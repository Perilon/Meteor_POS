<seg id="166"> The manufacturers of jet aircraft feud about the width of the seats at stake in large orders </seg>
<seg id="167"> Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft was a bitter dispute about the width of a tourist class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Literary dispute around the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always in the spotlight of the airlines, with the amount allocated to them space plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week called for the introduction of industry standard that would seat width of no less than 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class, but its main U.S. rival, Boeing says that it must solve the airline. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales all larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 expected potentially record orders. </seg>
<seg id="171"> The design of the rear of the plane-especially, whether sitting 9 or 10 people in a row-occupies a central place in the statements about economic efficiency of new projects &quot;mini-aircraft.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing argues that its new 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus says that its competing version of the A350 will be transported in the economy class, 350 people on the seat width of 18 inches, located on nine in a row. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Giants aircraft often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> And now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the show in Dubai, where the 777X, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers a slide showing three people in the restaurant, pressed to each other, under the name &quot;would you agree on this?.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> &quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John dashing. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With the change of diet people gain weight, but aircraft seats cardinal has not changed. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the early 1970&apos;s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards of modern travel, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American men between the ages of 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A waist circumference of middle-American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data, in the health service. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus says that its competitor to the concept of the seat of the 1950s, when the average waist circumference, recently called &quot;reactive audience,&quot; was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus says that ordered the study attesting that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities. </seg>
<seg id="184"> According to her, studies show that the convenience of salon depends not only on the width of the seats. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It really boils down to providing airline of choice and the ability to do that in their opinion they should make for success,&quot; said specialist Boeing on the salons Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don&apos;t want us to have decided for them, that will bring them profits. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it increasingly becomes a factor that can affect profits. </seg>
<seg id="189"> This dispute is the race for orders for the planes, estimated at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades-enough to change the relationship between American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As first reported in July, the Reuters news agency, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Both Airbus and Boeing say about 20-percent increase in profitability at one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The characteristics of the Boeing based in part on comparing 10-seat rows 777X with original 9-seater layout rows of constructive solutions 777. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The win in the unit cost of production is reduced when compared with 10-seat layout in use today. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;The reason that Boeing is doing, is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort of Airbus in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say salons with a full 10-seater series for existing 777-X indicate that many passengers prefer tight seating that can go hand-in-hand with lower rates. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;The seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view offer Airbus due to a threat from 777-th model,&quot; said specialist interior Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing do not put chairs, but offer the catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Traveling around the world, the sellers of jet aircraft even blocking a Roulette to check the competing design. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Commending the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout of the salon for budget airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus A350 offers 10-seat rows, but says that she still did not sell. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for additional modifications salons, offering a wider seats near the aisle on some of their planes. </seg>

<seg id="225"> After the Armistice in 1992 it became an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again plunge into full-scale conflict, but recent events made me nervous foreign investors and local residents. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in north-west could raise more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US. </seg>
<seg id="228"> The ruling party&apos;s Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the party of Renamo accuse each other in the tensions. </seg>

<seg id="247"> It is unclear what capability the Renamo, but it has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and cars on a key motorway leading from the north to the south. </seg>

<seg id="358"> Scientists shed light on how the tail of dogs are associated with her mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier research has shown that happy dogs by strings in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while the alarmed dogs Palaguachi tail mainly in the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in vilenie tail and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trotsky University, says: &quot;It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in the formation of the stimulators that generate positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we have tried to look at this and other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that, like humans, dogs have the right-hand side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile Povilionis tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the frequency of heartbeat animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes going in one direction and sometimes in another </seg>
<seg id="367"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the dogs video with dogs-or naturalistic version, or a silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we were able to manipulate the motion of the tail and send the tail more left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="368"> When they saw that otherwise nothing expresses the dog had driven the tail right (from the point of view of wagging her tale dogs), they remained completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they noticed that the tail was left bent mainly (again from the point of view of wagging her tale dogs), their heart rate was more frequent and they looked alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Professor Vallortigara said that he doesn&apos;t think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from her experience, what movements they should worry, and what is not. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He says: &quot;If several meetings with other dogs and often Melanie their tail in one side is associated with more friendly behavior, while the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of emotions his animal. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Expert in the field of behavior of Dogs by John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the veterinary school at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln have found that dogs turn your head to the left, if you look at an aggressive dog, and right, if you look at happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot; Dogs often approached the dog-robot when Melanie her tail was left, not right, rather than to become alarmed, &quot; opposite behavior towards Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceived animals in films or dogs-robots as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Could be useful in the study of how dogs react to these dogs, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> &quot;While the various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, given the ease with which it can be registered their behavior, perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes going in one direction and sometimes in another. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Whether the elite of Europe to do business with England? </seg>
<seg id="382"> The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to bring together representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="383"> With this purpose we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK business and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a broad slice of the business in the UK, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="385"> The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We found out that the vast majority of companies are now looking for opportunities for exports outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are in stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They want a government that gave priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reform of EU institutions. </seg>

<seg id="421"> Complete refusal from animal products harmful. </seg>
<seg id="422"> In animal proteins are indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Be sure to include in the diet at least milk or eggs, &quot; says nutritionist Marina bogey. </seg>
<seg id="424"> She cites the example of fish, containing essential fatty acid omega-3. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Most rich them vegetable oil-linen. </seg>
<seg id="426"> &quot;In order to consume it in the necessary for human beings, need gallons to drink Aneckstein or&quot; says the nutritionist. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia special attention to diet, you need to spend the winter. </seg>
<seg id="428"> In this season of vegetarianism especially is in question. </seg>
<seg id="429"> In terms of our realities are imposed heavy demands on the food. </seg>
<seg id="430"> In order not to freeze, you need increased calorie. </seg>
<seg id="431"> &quot;If people limit themselves on pet products, respectively, this calorie helps,&quot; says a specialist. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Agree with that doctor-nutritionist Olga OSCE. </seg>
<seg id="433"> She adds that imported fruits and vegetables-not a way. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Man better to eat mainly products, which are grown in the region of residence or where he was born. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The genetic code is configured the best learning and digest these foods. </seg>
<seg id="436"> And in the winter people want not OK to Magritte and hot Cupchik or even something Unhasting, &quot; explains his position as a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="437"> According to her, that can eat vegan, truly useful different grains, cereals, legumes, vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries. </seg>

<seg id="451"> &quot;The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, bones tomorrow will not recover,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="452"> All surveyed specialists-physicians agree about low winter as grown in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="453"> What to bring and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer essential we trace elements than (grown) in open ground. </seg>
<seg id="454"> &quot;The quality of the products is not,&quot; says Bohay. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse fruits and vegetables are far from ideal standards. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Sometimes the desire of manufacturers to collect more detrimental to quality. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;The apples are brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and Lesnevich, tasteless tomatoes and neuropathy,&quot; cites examples of the medic, adding that they probably are excessive amounts of fertilizer. </seg>
<seg id="458"> And become the suppliers not vitamins, and fiber. </seg>

<seg id="463"> Russia outside the urban pollution by car </seg>
<seg id="464"> Attempts to solve transport problems major cities were observed in most cities around the world since the second half of the 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time of their use. </seg>
<seg id="466"> A widely-known example of Singapore, where imposed strict quotas to increase the number of private cars, and the right of their purchase bought at auction. </seg>
<seg id="467"> His price may be two to three times more than the price of the car itself. </seg>
<seg id="468"> European cities, including London, have introduced fee for entry into the centre of the city. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called Green Zone, where allowed entry only cars with a certain access using the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric vehicles). </seg>
<seg id="470"> The agency for the protection of the environment of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012, &quot;five-year plan of clean air&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion). </seg>
<seg id="471"> According to Kommersant, director of the Department of Pollution Control transport Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection of Beijing whether Kunsheng, the main aim of the five-year plan-the reduction of air pollutants 20-35% by 2017, the increase of the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (5.2 million), as well as increase no more than 5% of the fuel in one vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="472"> According to the agency, now the vehicles in Beijing responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Among the main measures of the program-the restriction of the use of motor transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Among other things, the city&apos;s measure of &quot;green five-year plan &quot; include faster compared with the rest of the country in the transition to the euro standards fuel, the introduction of the local system of EastEnders and labelling of cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars in the central part of the city, the ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, creating a financial incentive programs to replace the old cars to hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including high-speed). </seg>
<seg id="475"> Among the automotive innovation of Beijing also applies to ban all private cars on movement within the fifth transport ring (just in the capital of China their six) one day a week (this information is contained in the trailing Mark vehicles), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only one-third the number in 2010). </seg>
<seg id="476"> According to Acting State Program &quot;environmental protection for 2012-2020,&quot; the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced by up to 128 (in 2012, there were 138). </seg>
<seg id="477"> According to the ministry, in 2011 on the &quot;mobile sources&quot; accounted for 41% of all emissions of polluting substances into atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="478"> In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times larger than industrial, and in St. Petersburg-nine times. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In the Russian Federation until only begin to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on city streets. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The director of the Institute of Economics and Transport Policy HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel is obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only when their complete versatility. </seg>
<seg id="481"> In the case of Moscow there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts-official and personal automobiles, as well as the cars of privileged users, which total number is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow). </seg>
<seg id="482"> A few days ago urbanists from Ecom in St. Petersburg has prepared the study, which analyzed the balance of urban areas between the residential development, with an area of the pavement and the number of vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The major findings of researchers: The centre of the city with roads in two times less required, and the majority of motorists who live in the center, do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on parking or simply on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="484"> As a result, it is proposed to build not parking and storage of cars, not to expand, and cut down on road a part (so that the streets were more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placement of personal transport within the borders of the protective zone of the historical centre (with a total area about 3212 hectares covering a number of the central districts of the city). </seg>
<seg id="485"> To fuel price will lead the tax maneuver, which provides the mineral extraction tax (Met) oil simultaneously with a decline of export duties and excises. </seg>
<seg id="486"> According to experts, these measures can bring in additional budget statement billion rubles. </seg>
<seg id="487"> The trip on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical aid </seg>
<seg id="488"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="490"> In this West African country doctors not so much-just one in 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="491"> Cast your vote here or through your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="492"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="493"> You can vote for him or any of the other top 10 Heroes, so he became a CNN Hero of the year. </seg>
<seg id="494"> This man will receive $250,000 to continue their outstanding work. </seg>
<seg id="495"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father was coming back to life and was again fall into an unconscious state, commuting to hospitals, which were not equipped properly, to help him. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Game Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981, near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="497"> At first he had only a broken hand, but the infection has spread to the brain and caused a haematoma that looked like myself for the rest of their lives. </seg>
<seg id="498"> &quot;In Cameroon was not neurosurgeons,&quot; said Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="499"> If we had the money, we would have took it from Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead Bwelle years was accompanied by his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get. </seg>
<seg id="501"> &quot;It is not easy,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="502"> &quot;You can walk away from home at 5 a.m., to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Patients very much. </seg>
<seg id="504"> That some may die because they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The situation is not much has changed since then, Father Bwelle died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor for 5,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="507"> For comparison, the ratio in the United States-one doctor on 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if the Adamaoua could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the cost of health care in it are private. </seg>
<seg id="510"> &quot;Their only problem is poverty,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="511"> And because of the poverty they can&apos;t enjoy their life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Bwelle became determined something to do. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Last year, Dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="514"> He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="515"> He also founded a non-profit organization ascovime, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost every Friday he and another 30 people clod in vans, bind to the roof with medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit in need of the village. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Is not always accompanies them luck. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Once, they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they come, they come across as genuine heroes: This is a holiday with songs and dances and best room, which only can suggest local residents. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Free medical care in these villages, this really is a cause for celebration, and Bwelle with his wide smile and boundless energy more than happy to join the fun. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The next morning, the team starts to take hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> &quot;We have 500 people on each trip,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They come from all over the area within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others may receive the crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates-documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply can&apos;t afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evenings the brigade performs simple operation under a local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> The operation, as a rule, are held in the building of the school, municipality or in the house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to post, to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitation of processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="531"> This unsustainable pace, but the determination of the brigade typically help to keep rural musicians. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday members of the brigade sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> This group, consisting of Cameroonian foreign doctors and medical students, has spent 700 free operations last year, and they know that their help could have huge significance for those they help. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One man explained that he received a free operation to cure hernia will allow him to operate again. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;This will change the future for me and my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon Bwelle also works nights in a private medical clinics around Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="538"> This is the second job, he said, provides 60 per cent of funding for his non-profit organizations; the rest are covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;I don&apos;t even know when he&apos;s asleep,&quot; said Kathy O Melli, medical student, the second year Drexelbrook University in Philadelphia, the volunteer group Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="540"> He has always either in hospital, or trying to earn money for the organization so that you can continue this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="541"> For future doctors and nurses, such as O Melli coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in implementation of its tasks, it is-practice that they never would have received at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> &quot;We got the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove the stain of blood or keep the tools for doctors bulle,&quot; said Mr. O Melli. </seg>
<seg id="543"> As a student, a sophomore, you would never have got such an opportunity in America. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The volunteers themselves usually pay for their own travel in Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But on arrival in Yaounde their meals, transport and training pays Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> &quot;He is a hero, without a doubt,&quot; said Mr. O Melli. </seg>
<seg id="547"> He gives his life to this organisation, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For Bwelle almost constant workload work is not a heavy challenge. </seg>
<seg id="549"> To help to live a happy life to others, to do this to his father promise is what brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy when you do this job,&quot; said Belle. </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope he sees that I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Go to the site ascovime and see what you can help. </seg>
<seg id="555"> For &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States has finally established a new name - &quot;The Circle&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> This week, the black list &quot; of the Russian mafia in America has been updated with new names and four companies. </seg>

<seg id="562"> In his opinion, &quot;fraternal circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of &quot;Russian mafia .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else, who would have confirmed the existence of this criminal organization,&quot; quoted Mr Galeotti American Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="564"> With Mr. Galeotti agree and professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley. </seg>
<seg id="565"> &quot;If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization,&quot; it quoted the words of the Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="566"> In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that &quot;brotherly circle&quot; unites in increasingly close Russian thieves in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The crime boss was killed in January of this year. </seg>
<seg id="568"> So, the activities of the lash Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashov replenishment of the list in 2012, was closely connected with his Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, had the dad Hasano nephew. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Nevertheless Mr Galeotti notes that some of the personality and have no ties to Usoyan. </seg>
<seg id="570"> According to him, they were united rather common financial and criminal interests, for example the delivery of drugs from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Meanwhile, the scandal around the &quot;fraternal circle&quot; Olatz Arruti-beloved singer Russian President Vladimir Putin-has attracted the attention of the Kremlin. </seg>

<seg id="611"> Ex-US intelligence worker Edward Snowden, most likely, will not be able to travel outside of Russia for the the tapped telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="612"> As told to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer the questions of the representatives of the German prosecutor general&apos;s office in writing or in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia virtually excluded. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;In this case he will lose the refugee status and can be issued to Washington countries-American allies,&quot; said the interlocutor of agency. </seg>
<seg id="615"> &quot;However, in principle, the general prosecutor&apos;s office and the Federal Republic of Germany could send in their representatives or to send written questions to Snowden,&quot; said the source, adding that the issue should be thrashed out at the international level. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Previously a member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian in Strebel reported that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of tapped by the American secret services of the German chancellor. </seg>

<seg id="619"> Despite the fact that the NSA, the US has blocked all his travel, Snowden is ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="620"> But to do this we need to clearly define the terms of his arrival, &quot; said the Strebel TV channel Euronews. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Snowden&apos;s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how-will decide itself. </seg>

<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia-consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive cuts in workers. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> The last time he entirely due to consumption, which almost does not ease the turnovers, &quot; said chief economist for Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens box, representing yesterday quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now the nominal wage growth in Russia-about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> With inflation at 6 percent, he will be able to provide future consumer demand roughly at the current level, at Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will optimize staff costs. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10%, GDP is only 2%, &quot; said Mr Field. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The company was faced with reduced profitability. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If it will not grow, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Not to raise the salaries of Russian business can&apos;t, &quot; said Barclays Capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment is near historic lows, the competition for workers. </seg>
<seg id="662"> To lure employees from the side or to keep current, employers have to raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia is supported and very rapid growth of PatrickDelany. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Mr. Field, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country, this kind of lending is not. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;The benefit to the economy from growth of PatrickDelany we no saw money not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; said the economist. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But the problem in the other-in Goldman Sachs expect growth of arrears on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="667"> These are mainly poor people who have nothing to offer in. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The interest on such loans high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, they often do not return, &quot; said Mr Field. </seg>
<seg id="670"> So the second threat to economic growth in Russia-a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The director of banking institute HSE Vasily Solodov already sees signs of a maturing of the banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit organizations, do not have access to cheap resources, has some of the state-owned banks, were forced to attract means from population at a high interest rate. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response, the state-owned banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, says economist. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit organization can not give loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If the state-owned banks will not abandon of dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solokov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Deprivation of licenses of some banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of mass crash. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;The state-owned banks with such a situation will not cope: The system of deposit insurance originally was not designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; warned the head of the Institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But consumption growth will slow and without crisis of non-payments, put in the investment bank, because of the refusal of indexing salaries of civil servants and the military, in the current version of the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> In part, the hit to consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partly: If the investments don&apos;t grow up (and preconditions to this no-see The Help), consumption growth will slow down, confidence in Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until sees no preconditions for implementation of pessimistic scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk is still the fall in oil prices,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> By his estimate, Russia&apos;s economy will begin to shrink with the cost of oil below $90 a barrel. </seg>
<seg id="684"> At Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to lower interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> There has been a paradoxical picture: Inflation has fallen, and banks began to raise rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> It may mean that they did not believe the central bank, declaring the transition to the targeting inflation, &quot; said Clemens column. </seg>
<seg id="687"> Interest rate policy of the central bank on market rates does not, only affects rates for interbank lending. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;For the central bank is the collapse of all hope,&quot; praised Clemens column. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Money received at auctions, the central bank, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> As soon as the reduced rate, changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the rouble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;Sooner or later, the central bank will realize that this strategy is not working,&quot; said Mr Field and reminded that to let the ruble in &quot;free swimming&quot; the state plans by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But will have to do this before, or to raise the key rate the central bank (5.5%), he says. </seg>
<seg id="693"> By his estimate, the ruble exchange rate now artificially inflated by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Ruble only one road-to weaken, &quot; concludes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if the central bank will Serenety in financiers even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of currency corridor is not part of the policy by the weakening of the ruble, it can bring down the ruble is much stronger. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snowden has agreed to give testimony about the tapped Merkel </seg>
<seg id="697"> A member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel met in Moscow with the Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="698"> During the meeting the parties discussed the question whether Snowden to be questioned as a witness in a federal prosecutor on the case about possible tapped the phone of German Chancellor Specktor USA. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Snowden has expressed a willingness to give the necessary testimony. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The meeting could take place either in Moscow, or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> He has made it clear, &quot; said Hans-Christian in Strebel-that knows a lot. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And despite the fact that the National Security Agency-led by Keith Alexander has blocked all his travel, Snowden is ready to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> But you first need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, US lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding spyware. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill to impose additional restrictions on the activities of the American intelligence agencies electronic. </seg>
<seg id="706"> FAA: &quot; Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not to call from your mobile phone) </seg>
<seg id="707"> The passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, to work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers should not expect that the changes will happen immediately. </seg>
<seg id="709"> How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, &quot; said FAA Administrator Michael worth at the press conference. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their planes meet new guidelines and that they update their textbook for the members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The FAA said that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already unveiled plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;Depending on the status of the plan we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; said FAU. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the aircraft door closes. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain will not welcome. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers must turn off their devices once again when a plane goes down for planting, and to not enable them, as long as the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="717"> In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes properly protected from electronic interference, can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, said FAU. </seg>
<seg id="718"> The majority of new aircraft and other planes, modified in such a way that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> The Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;After the new policy will be safely implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier, to achieve this, it will be a safe choice, &quot; said Glading. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We frankly are tired of feeling &quot;duty at school,&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But Internet connection for web browsing, e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be banned at the height of less than 10,000 feet, according to the agency. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in a mode of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Thus, there is still no &quot;Words with Friends&quot; - intellectual Internet games, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was the famous incident: The actor was removed from the aircraft the airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="725"> But heavier devices, such as laptops, still will need to be in the luggage department, because they can someone to injure, if will fly across the room. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Calls from the mobile phone in flight will also still prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Regulatory authority on telephone calls to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="728"> FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="729"> Last month Mark Rosenker from the National Council on transport security, national security expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered at risk. </seg>
<seg id="730"> &quot;Cell phones-it really is a problem, not just because potentially it could create interference to navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can create interference for cell phone towers when the plane is in the air,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study this issue, recommended last month that the government has allowed a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> In recent years, been growing pressure on the FAA with the aim of easing of restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Critics, such as the Democrat senator from Missouri Claire the MacCaskill, argue that bans for no good reason related to security. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The observance of the restrictions also becomes more difficult to provide, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices. </seg>
<seg id="736"> FAA began to limit use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of fail for navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to carry the FM-radio-high-tech gadgets at that time. </seg>
<seg id="737"> New airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also are being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The airline to offer passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude already for several years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The planes, modified for Wi-Fi systems, also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The vast majority of adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, &quot; said Worth. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices typically emit radio signals a much lower power than the previous generation devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Device for reading electronic books, for example, emit only a minimal signals when switching the pages. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But the signals are becoming more powerful when the device download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those who sought the easing of restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices was the company Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011 the company representatives have downloaded a airliner with their devices for reading e-books on the Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said that he believes interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA allowed the pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during the landings on the devices in poor visibility. </seg>
<seg id="750"> A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="769"> New antinational vaccine can deprive the process of smoking pleasure </seg>
<seg id="770"> Scientists have developed antinational vaccine, which could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="771"> One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further tests are needed before trials on humans, it will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the early results are encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We very much hope that such a strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, surrogate methods available in the market today, but they discovered that nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools,&quot; said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="774"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for antinational of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Selectively the virus infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Antibodies trail any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="777"> In vaccinated mice, which subsequently gave the nicotine, continued their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="778"> And mice that were not given the vaccine, &quot; relaxed, &quot; and this is an indication that the nicotine to the brain, &quot; say the researchers. </seg>
<seg id="779"> These experiments described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Previous tobacco vaccine failed, because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="781"> In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, the injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would give the children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking. </seg>
<seg id="785"> &quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will not get that pleasure due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them to get rid of this habit,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="803"> This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier flight may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Mr. O Melli said that changes to procedures on the Web site and its frontier is meant to ensure that passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="805"> A new frontier for hand baggage will not be charged until the summer, though the date is not yet set. </seg>
<seg id="806"> The passengers often complain about fees for baggage and other fees, but airlines their love. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They argue that the processing of baggage costs money, and the passengers who need this service, need to pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many on Wall Street believe adding a baggage fees a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> But most of them are not concerned the fees for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first fee for carry-on luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with this collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the additional fees. </seg>
<seg id="812"> By his estimate in the report from December 2011, the fee for carry-on baggage brings spirit $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, a former senior manager at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Flight spirit, and he was wondering what he will find at the gate, where the passengers will face an unusual gathering spirit for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> &quot;The process of planting was the smooth of those that I have seen for his career in the airlines,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing passed quickly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="817"> Frontier also follows the spirit in the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, can leave all the bank and that Goliath coffee will be provided free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It will still be free to hand out water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> Us Airways short time was trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned that after seven months, after the passenger began to complain, and no other major airline not followed its example. </seg>
<seg id="821"> The initiative frontier on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is it the latest measure to attract customers to its Web site. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It gave to all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to turn in on-line travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> All but frontier went further in this area. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September, she began to give two times less frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday she cut the bonus number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier, were purchased from online travel agencies, would get 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the frontier. </seg>
<seg id="829"> The frontier has a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and unprofitable. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Revenues decreased by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic is trying to improve finances frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline. </seg>

<seg id="833"> And now the news because of the ocean-namely, from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel has dealt a blow to Russian missiles, which reportedly was meant &quot;to Hezbollah.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="834"> Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition is to destroy the November 1 its production of chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It was done in the framework of an agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and the United States not to carry out a military operation to which they closely came this summer. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Read more about weapons and about what all this means for the Syrian president, will tell our Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for it. </seg>
<seg id="838"> More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas. </seg>
<seg id="839"> And the punishment came. </seg>
<seg id="840"> But not in the form of U.S. bombing, and in the form of the transaction, which was a friend of Assad-Vladimir Putin. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Syria give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year. </seg>
<seg id="842"> And today is an important milestone. </seg>
<seg id="843"> The group of international experts, reported that Syria has declared the factories for the production from 1999. </seg>
<seg id="844"> More long-term and difficult task-the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it. </seg>
<seg id="845"> As we understand, this is about a thousand tons. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Previously, Washington said that Assad&apos;s days are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="847"> I believe that Assad must go. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The question is not if this will happen, but when it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="849"> He is no longer legitimate and must leave. </seg>
<seg id="850"> But Assad remains. </seg>
<seg id="851"> And he feels more confident. </seg>
<seg id="852"> His forces are still using artillery, rockets and napalm. </seg>
<seg id="853"> His opponents divided and poorly armed. </seg>
<seg id="854"> His people forced to leave their homes, many go hungry. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Some people have to eat leaves and cats. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for a mass murder. </seg>
<seg id="857"> An agreement on chemical weapons are called success of diplomacy, the inspectors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself was impressed with the man, ready to cooperate. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer tough questions. </seg>
<seg id="859"> When a child dies from hunger, his mother is hardly easier from the fact that he was not killed by chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Assad is held. </seg>

<seg id="863"> The Lenin district court of Tomsk was sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work resident of the city, which was placed in a social network video extremist orientation, told RIA Novosti on Friday, a representative of the press service of the regional court. </seg>
<seg id="864"> According to the court, in March 2013 the man posted on his page on the popular social network the video, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials. </seg>
<seg id="865"> It was a criminal case on the article in the criminal code of the Russian Federation &quot;actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as the humiliation of the man publicly committed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="866"> &quot;The district court has considered the case in a specific order and found a man guilty of committing the crime, the punishment in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work,&quot; said the agency. </seg>
<seg id="867"> She added that the man fully recognized their guilt. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Parents visibly intersex children can choose &quot;uncertain&quot; floor&quot; </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany became the first European country that has recognized the third floor of children born with external sex organs intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="870"> Newborn will no longer be necessarily attributed to male or female gender. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify gender as uncertain or unknown in their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about the newborn&apos;s gender, and to counter discrimination visibly intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One visibly intersex people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am not a man and a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> I will remain created by doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars. </seg>
<seg id="875"> About one in two thousand children, charities each year is neither a boy nor a girl. </seg>
<seg id="876"> They have the intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development &quot; - the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, Honda (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed external sex organs. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Wallace Simpson, perhaps, was a intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the US say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information to assign it than to wait and monitor psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all, it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="879"> New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> Visibly intersex children create an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most children don&apos;t have them,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can assign to the floor without surgery and then to see how developed a personality. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science about how the child will develop any gender identity, not too accurate. </seg>
<seg id="884"> No one can answer questions about why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It&apos;s like a mystery about why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes visibly intersex people as different from transgender or transgender because the state has less to do with gender, and to their biological structure which is neither exclusively male nor female sex, and typical of both at once or not is for one of them. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also gives a general idea of the discrimination that confronts visibly intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes of prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boys with gender variations now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal has already allowed adults to be male, female or &quot;third gender&quot; in its official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia this year, Welby became the first man in the world, recognized asexual, upheld in court the right to maintain an indefinite sexual status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be the third rohace in addition to the M and F-X, is visibly intersex. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still arouse controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this strongly Catholic country, signed a petition on the &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> American Web site Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that &quot;in a situation when the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity-no, we Pereverzeva two more pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="896"> One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Web site baby zone that she would have preferred that the children have sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Raising a child is difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; she said the Web site for parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The children need stability and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, children born with both male and female sex organs, called androgyne-named handsome Greek god who had signs of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And yet just ten years ago the medical community perceive gender as a leaf on which all you can wipe, and then again to draw. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many disputed ethical reason for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to the floor when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="902"> &quot;In the mid-20th century, it was called &quot; urgent psychiatric case, &quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When these children were born, you called Not the psychiatrist-you called the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The dominant theory about how to treat children with genitalia intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender easily amenable to change. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He introduced the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social-how parents raise a child, interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether a person is considered to be a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one case of 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories were called into question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He told the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during a sloppy circumcision, fully to castrate child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> &quot;Mani has presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When the boy was about 15 years old, he was a boy and married to a woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But in the 38 years he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> The Drescher said that today, some doctors are still &quot;apply this model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who experienced these operations to change sex, declared himself, &quot;dissatisfied with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="913"> Such was the case and Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but with the genitals of intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Doctors were unable to pinpoint whether there has been a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to live &quot;full life&quot; men. </seg>
<seg id="915"> So soon after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He began to give women hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I knew that I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the 18 years he was appointed the vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But while in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he demanded a medical documentation. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he learned, it was terrible. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which didn&apos;t give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of genitals. </seg>
<seg id="924"> After learning the truth, he again became the man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The operation made him infertile. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today he is in defense of others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to bring in the normal perception of people with intersexuality. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Association of Legal Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;encourages to labels and the stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and to give the child &quot; undetermined sex, &quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We believe that it is better to a male or female gender, then to wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we have not yet seen, how will this law, so all we can do is build assumptions. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexual identity,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The German law implies its assigned at birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It is a battle, in which young children should not enter at this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr son the Baratz, mammolist radiologist from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law &quot;will support&quot; as parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> The daughter of Baratz, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a disorder of sexual development under the name &quot;syndrome of full P.O. to androgens.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="939"> Because its androgenic receptors incorrect work, Kathy developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="940"> She has her vagina, but not of the uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, at 29, Katie is married and a residency in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Despite the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent via adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood. </seg>
<seg id="943"> &quot;The law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves,&quot; said Bartz. </seg>
<seg id="944"> He gives them time to do some tests and to understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they would be male or female. </seg>
<seg id="945"> In this case you in order-and raise the child, love child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a lovely child, and you feel the joy. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We don&apos;t need to quickly do the operation, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the emotion, which is driven by parents, because they don&apos;t feel that doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> In the end the child will decide how Paul him or her more comfortable, and it is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="950"> This gives the children the opportunity to make a decision on their own. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Us Secretary of State: Security forces sometimes &quot;went too far&quot; in the data collection </seg>
<seg id="952"> Us Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that the data collection and Prasloski American intelligence agencies sometimes &quot; went too far,&quot; nevertheless politician noted that appeared in mass media information about the wiretap 70 million people does not correspond to reality. </seg>

<seg id="954"> Yes, in some cases, it went too far and was unlawful. </seg>

<seg id="961"> Judges praised the Fenton for his not on the years developed an innate ability of dealing with horses. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The toffee has received the highest score for appearance and character. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The Fenton gave toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been involved with Shetland pony every day. </seg>

<seg id="965"> They had a lot of rivals, but the two have gone with the Gold Cup and Rosicky. </seg>
<seg id="966"> It was only his second performance with toffee, and we were all delighted when he won. </seg>

<seg id="970"> He fled on the sand along the entire length of the stage and, although looked so tiny, it did its job. </seg>
<seg id="971"> The Fenton crazy of animals-he loves horses, tractors and farm, and he has two chickens, about which he cares. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Judging from how he started, soon he will have to take part in &quot; Horse of the year &quot; - and I&apos;m sure he will perform well. </seg>

<seg id="985"> Court has suspended the execution of decisions on the practice of &quot;stop-and-search &quot; in the New York Police Department </seg>
<seg id="986"> On Thursday the Court of Appeal Federal District has suspended enforcement of a court ruling requiring changes to stop-and-search &quot; of the New York Police Department, and has suspended the judge from the case. </seg>
<seg id="987"> The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the US said that the execution of decisions judges Shira Sheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city. </seg>
<seg id="988"> In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in how he carried out a programme of detention and interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="989"> The city has appealed her decision and issued a corrective measures, including an order to appoint the controller to help police station to change practices and related training program. </seg>
<seg id="990"> On Thursday the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the request to suspend. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The appeals court stated the need to remove judges because she had breached the code of conduct of U.S. judges and 1863 with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing public response to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people unnecessarily referring to blacks and Latinos under the program &quot;Stop-and-search.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> She was appointed as the external supervisor to oversee large-scale changes that include the reforms in the field of policies, training and monitoring, and decided to run a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations, where most of the arrests. </seg>

<seg id="995"> Debate on the appeal of the city should be held after March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The tactic of &quot;stop and search &quot; was criticised by many lawyers on civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="997"> &quot;Stop-and-search&quot; practiced for decades, in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased sharply under the administration of an independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 of absolute record 684 330 people, most of them blacks and Latinos. </seg>
<seg id="998"> In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed in court a collective action. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Supporters of the changes in the program &quot;Stop-and-search&quot; in the New York Police Department said that these changes will end the unfair practice, will generate more reliable and efficient police service and could affect how other departments police implement the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Opponents argue that the changes will lower the morale of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police because of the reduction in the number of officers on several thousand over the last decade. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The judge noted that it does not stop the practice of &quot;stop-and-search,&quot; which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stops of people. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after the signing of the association with the EU </seg>
<seg id="1003"> The prime minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will be considerably lower after the country will sign an association agreement with the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> He stated this in the course of conversation with readers of their pages on Facebook.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1005"> I can definitely tell you that prices are determined by many factors, including, among others, and customs duties. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> Now, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on free trade area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be considerably lower. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> And it will mean that prices should fall further. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;It is with regard to goods that come from the EU,&quot; wrote Azarov. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> But, nevertheless, there also should not be raising prices. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Therefore, messages on billboards, which in recent years many have appeared in our country that association with the EU is rising prices, it&apos;s not quite true, or more precisely to speak-not so, &quot; - summed Mr. Azarov. </seg>

<seg id="1014"> Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> The decision on funding for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> &quot;The government has proposed a package of emergency relief measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems, standing in front of the state,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The package of $325 million includes $31 million on a campaign blitz on routine operations. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and undergoing surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome a backlog. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> There is also money for clinics, patients without prior records in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care at the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and implementation of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> &quot;These investments will be made by leading doctors to implement ideas about how best to help the health system Tasmania,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania, will work in the strict accountability and responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> The state will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to get the money to the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends such additional funds. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Will be created a commission of three people to make sure the state provides the services as efficient and effective. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million nothing will decide &quot;if will not follow the real reform that would put the health system Tasmania on a more sustainable basis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to its request for urgent aid, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> &quot;I hope that the package of federal assistance will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system of this state from critical states,&quot; said Mr. Wilke. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s announcement represents a &quot; solution, similar to face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the state pulled out $430 million from the health system, &quot; he told the ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> When the government lifts the state of almost half a billion dollars, and the commonwealth is investing $300 million, you can&apos;t pretend that this is good news. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Mr Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> The cry of despair of Obama voter </seg>
<seg id="1033"> I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change </seg>
<seg id="1034"> He says that Obama has allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to nullify laudable efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> The obstructionism can&apos;t serve as an excuse for problems with the Web site reformulate Obama health systems, Attack of the drones </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Memoirs about the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been </seg>
<seg id="1037"> The Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at the medical faculty of Harvard University. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I&apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I thought that this book will inspire me in a time of gloom on the second course of medical faculty and will revive in me a sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It&apos;s called &quot; The Audacity to Win, &quot; and it is a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When I finished the evening to write the reports according to my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when the policy inspired millions of people, and the performances could capture the spirit. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Victory in the elections was impressive, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates wept with joy, and my parents I did all newspapers, which only they could find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> The White House was supposed to come to a young team of strategists, and the nation was ready to change. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> At the time of Obama into office in 2008, his level of support was 82%. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The return at present is a rude awakening, as Wudeluene from dreams. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> It is hard to remember those days of optimism-they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> In the years that have passed since I cast my first ballot, the changes really happened. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It was something that I even could not imagine. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical care until the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of &quot;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell, &quot; killing Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked many attempts to move our country forward: Immigration reform, the choice of a public health care and closing bases in Guantanamo, among others. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But after countless number of times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I have ended the explanation that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I have reached the point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> The obstructionism of the Republicans can&apos;t explain permission to wiretap foreign leaders or strikes by drones on innocent children in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> He can&apos;t explain the data collection about the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of whistleblower, revealing improper actions of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> He could not explain the killing of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that attach the White House efforts to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And the last time he can&apos;t justify that fails to create a simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I don&apos;t know, if I was to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the leadership may contradict to political campaigns, preconstruction? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It is obvious, that the work on elective office is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and such random events, like the massacre in Newtown. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Yet all my examples listed above, you can see that they were largely by his own choice of the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> And this is what bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney was a strange and an alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I thought that in his second term Obama, freed from the constraints of future elections, will justify the hopes, about which we have heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> However, when this week, Obama&apos;s approval rating has dipped below 45%, to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It makes me homesick for many promises that was gone. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton has dealt Obama a resounding defeat in a primary election in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At the meeting, according to the analysis of the causes of failure, he told his employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to their purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> &quot;I want to ensure that we back our appeal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> &quot;We have to remember who we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1074"> Has been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Comments expressed in this opinion belongs exclusively to the Nathaniel to Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> In Egypt takes the oath the first freely elected president </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of its celebrations is unlikely to Znamenov an end of political struggle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt,&quot; when he was sworn in, becoming the first freely elected president, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> &quot;We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life-absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization, which served as a target for tough actions of successive governments. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers, when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only a few hundred supporters gathered near the courthouse, to welcome a new president, and, unlike the presidential pumps in the time of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Although Morsi was derided as uncharismatic &quot; spare wheel &quot;brothers,&quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and Friday&apos;s speech, in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only Islamists, but also to all those who want to end the uprising of 2011 against Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> &quot;Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges are encased in the panelled hall, where he has taken the oath of office. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his inaugural speech. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> He was given an official reception with military orchestra, who performed the national anthem, during which he stood to attention. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Attended a military figure is Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;the army and the people are one hand,&quot; chanted the hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, a Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, completed the authoritarian Mubarak&apos;s rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived the military council who took the case from the deposed leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Speech Morsi in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Schools urged to pay more attention to the math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> High school English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, Romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> The exam will also be presented &quot;vneprogrammnymi texts&quot; to encourage broader reading. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> The combined English literature and language will be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> From 2015, pupils will be obliged to take a final exam on the tongue, with persistent recommendations of English literature as a separate exam. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The Department of Education should tomorrow to release new training programs for English and maths-the subjects, subjected to radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> He will have to make changes in other major items in the next year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Separately, the regulatory body in the sphere of Ofqual exams will present a revised structure of final exams high school, with a new system of assessments and less coursework. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that was &quot;reached a broad consensus that we need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting that high school graduation exams would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Research shows that English schools devote less time mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week in the quarter) than in most countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> For comparison-Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, pupils are engaged about 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Although formal demands to spend more time in the schedule mathematics will not be, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings, are likely to serve as an incentive for providing schools with extra training on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> In educational plan more attention will be paid to the tasks of real life, &quot; including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football-the cause strife? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma in the &quot;Open tribune&quot; politicians and pundits have been talking about how to preserve peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals sounded and this: To ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game-some scandals and discord. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The Speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded about recent events in Biryulevo and said that to reduce the degree of tension in society,&quot; politicians and media should be valid in the statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir, who in one of the television threatened to encircle the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they don&apos;t want to limit birth rates... </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All the speakers talked about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples inhabiting Russia that gave the debate a sobornost. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maxim Grigoryev said that events in Biryulevo - &quot;the conflict that it was possible to predict&quot; but &quot;these questions we have answers too many people and the authorities,&quot; and many a child without eye. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time in relation to migrants practiced Europe, according to the itinerary, failed, and we need to find its way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> The historian Yuri Petrov has high hopes on a new unified history textbook. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> &quot;We have to create a textbook on the history and culture of the peoples of the country, schoolchildren in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennady Zyuganov offered to introduce criminal responsibility for &quot; appeals to dismember Russia: &quot; If the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you are arrested and will give 20 years of prison Aneckstein which&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky worked very hard &quot;not to stoke.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, he accused journalists who are sick and acute national problems at a public debate: &quot;In the heat of the debate knows what to say Aneckstein which&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The leader of the faction &quot;United Russia&quot; Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised reporters to sign a &quot;charter&quot; and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same obligations can take on and politics. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> We have taken about 30 of the laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is installed, said Mr. Vasiliev. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> As an example, he cited a law that imposes on the regional and municipal authorities responsible for international peace on their territory. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Ludmila Andrienko delight about this law has not divided: There are no &quot; clear idea about what is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> It means that actors will interpret differently the volume of these powers. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> In addition, municipalities no personnel needed to address such complex issues, no money, and methodical recommendations, which they could use, they don&apos;t give... </seg>
<seg id="1127"> The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Gajimet Safaraliev offered to create a special office with formidable name &quot; to the ministry of national security,&quot; which dealt with issues of national policy. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s was led by a similar agency, abolished later, opposed it. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It is enough to have at the federal level, a special person, &quot; minister without portfolio,&quot; to which one might ask, if that. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> &quot;We are on the edge, shells screaming, it is very important to the representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together to oppose provocations, and this work must get decent information support,&quot; said a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church on relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> No neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, religious, including, to be, in his opinion, should not. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Then Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: &quot;More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, another to need, but their push on the road, not on the road,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;The Road &quot; is the development of football: &quot; Football player beaten all crowd, the burning flags, comrades with stones throw each other... </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe don&apos;t need us such a football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> There is another kind of sport-rugby is called... </seg>
<seg id="1136"> &quot;Equally, they will not be in the world in this sport Aneckstein all&quot; - hotly spoke prioress. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> In rugby in the Caucasus, no one to play will not be Aneckstein which-immediately intervened, Mr Zhirinovsky. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You still curling them will offer Aneckstein Research </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Need to know about identity, it&apos;s still that the Georgians &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; to offer ...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands has different representatives of the Moscow club during the game with local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Football will have to ban all across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Recognition of the National Security Agency&apos;s increasing paranoia of corporations against government surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> On the instructions of the Federal Service for the protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> German media say the BfV had hoped to discover antennas listening devices, and these actions had entailed negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Clapper, director of national intelligence in the US in September, again assured that the United States does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who resolutely-began to publish its treasure trove of intelligence secrets to the United States, European governments and leaders of companies no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Reports that the National Security Agency in the United States watched the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored, providers of cloud services, including Google and Yahoo, has raised paranoia corporations, caused by the surveillance state, to new heights. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The last straw was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel auditioned, probably about ten years. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, potential targets are and business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> I think it is likely that these data are used by a mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> &quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; says Oliver of Gruen, president of bitmi Association, which represents small and medium IT company in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> German companies are convinced that the United States now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> All documents, pursued by Mr Snowden, however, so far there was no evidence that the United States has handed over to commercial secrets of foreign companies in their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks specific opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce their dependence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Businessmen are skeptical about this. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in the German parliament, says that we must create German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can only close his eyes and slowly to open them again... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> &quot;This is not an option,&quot; says the Hasso Plattner, president of the German company-the software provider for Business SAP. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If there is a necessity for a powerful European IT industry, should not allow her to die more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> All subsidized in Germany: From coal to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> All, except the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> And yet the scope and the technical and agencies on US spying, which became famous thanks to the Snowden revelations, was a shock for some of the companies that used to be thought that the biggest risk of surveillance is China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> A big shift is happening in the cloud technologies, where leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are located in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> According to the study conducted by a trade association of Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-US members had abandoned plans to use the services of the US-based cloud provider after revelations of American data mining programme Prism. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Jim Snabe, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: &quot;We are seeing that consumers are asking a question that was not there a year ago, namely: Where are my data and can you guarantee that they physically will remain in this jurisdiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Many German leaders argue that the last message-this is just confirmation of what they already knew: Powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and hence this data must be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> What is the economic espionage, &quot; it is not surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> He always had a place. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> &quot;It was a subject of discussion for many years and not changed substantially in the current controversy,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> Americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we also spying for them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Leaders of corporations typically do not like to boast of those retaliatory measures that they have taken, as this may give an advantage to the enemy. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In large companies have long been internalized the idea that to take a free USB flash drive at the exhibition or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudent. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich&apos;s Hackenberg, member of the Board of Directors of automotive company Audi, said that for many years it is standard practice to collect mobile phones before meetings of the board so that they could not be used as listening devices. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The Federal Service for the protection of the Constitution, Germany recommends that managers of companies to consider the possibility of using a pre-paid mobile phone during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> A prepaid mobile phones later perception. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> &quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,&quot; warns the report BfV. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> The United States warn their own company on economic espionage from other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> National intelligence summary USA in February put France, together with Russia and Israel in the second series of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German companies confirmed that when talking about economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst of all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Bernard of Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency the DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: &quot;The service know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated because of a fire in one of the terminals. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> The unknown man opened fire in a third terminal at 09.30 o&apos;clock local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30). </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Guard evacuated employees and passengers in the second and third terminal. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> According to preliminary data, the man was shooting a rifle high capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Several people, including an officer of security in the United States, were injured. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> The police returned fire and detained the attacker. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> He easily wounded. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Tripodi denies that subject to the influence of Obaid </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The former Labour minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be a helper to investigate anti-corruption oversight body of this state. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The former minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi disproves amendments in order to rent seaside objects at the request of his political mentor Eddie of Obaid, secretly owned stakes in the three properties on public land. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its investigation, lobbied whether Mr. Obaid several ministers of extending the lease agreements on circular Ki, where the family of Obeid owns two restaurants and a cafe, without tender after the expiration of their actions in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> It now is investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi knew about the secret part Mr. Obaid in real estate, after testimony, data, former deputy head of the administration of Mr. Tripodi Lynn Espol on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Within a few years of discussions, which began in 2005, the government insisted that the rent was exhibited on the outdoor contest. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The lessees were against it, and also wanted more long-term lease. </seg>

<seg id="1278"> Currently, the investigators are all the circumstances, and given the legal assessment to the actions of employees of the kindergarten. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> After the accusations of Durnovaria Eugenia Vasilieva began </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Eugenia Vasilieva, to the person that almost a year on media attention, has still never been commented on numerous publications in the press as a theft in the Defense Ministry, and about her personally-Relations with the ex-Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and passion about the valuable things. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> But on 1 November the figurant case &quot;Oboronservis&quot; broke the silence. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In an interview with Life News Vasiliev said: &quot;Originally, of course, the task was exactly one: To pull out of me any negative information about the former secretary of defense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Was blackmail on the subject that I have to give evidence, otherwise they will put me in jail. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Today, these threats stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Then we go to court, we are going to prove his innocence. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> In the victory we are sure 100 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> At the same time from an interview I can make the conclusion that, perhaps, most Vasilieva hit that she has no matter with taste. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Probably, in a statement, the official representative of the RF Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings, which collected the figurant case &quot;Oboronservis,&quot; was a forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Among the arrested property there are a number of pictures that Hostess, being confident in their deep knowledge of art, had acquired as masterpieces of world art. </seg>

<seg id="1291"> Some paintings, stolen from the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Then finally acknowledged that they were not stolen from the Defense Ministry, meanwhile, told me that bad with taste. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments? </seg>
<seg id="1294"> In my opinion, it&apos;s just an outrage, &quot; says Vasiliev. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> On the question of whether she admits their guilt although in one of 12 Benjamin her criminal episodes, Vasiliev said: &quot; Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> To nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Moreover, there is no damage of the Russian Federation, we&apos;re talking about. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Simply enter the people, and that&apos;s all. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In addition, in response to today&apos;s announcement of the RF SC that Vasilieva shies away from the study of the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of Figurado said that he and his client &quot; investigator does not meet with the materials of the case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1300"> That has caused to the revelations under house arrest Vasilieva, still not communicating with the press? </seg>
<seg id="1301"> Perhaps, as a woman, she has not been able to answer the charge in bad taste? </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Or right journalists &quot; Komsomolskaya Pravda, claimed a couple of days ago, that she &quot; in even greater trans under house arrest &quot; over News of the reconciliation Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and in his return to the bosom of the family? </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Known military observer &quot;KP&quot; Victor Barnes in his article &quot; Serdyukov returned to his wife? &quot;Wrote:&quot; Investigators do not rule out that after such turmoil it may become more talkative on the interrogation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Earlier Vasiliev some accusations of illegal sale of real estate of defense took upon themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The defender Juventus Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the championship match against Italy with Parma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1306"> According to Football Italia coaching staff took the decision not to include him in the game, in order to keep before Game 4 of the first round of group round of the Champions League with Real Madrid. </seg>

<seg id="1323"> On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown, urged Mr. Carmack unequivocally support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Mr Brown said: &quot;High-speed railways has all chances to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in general arguments for a high-speed railroad across the UK.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1325"> So we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for the construction of high-speed railways in Scotland, creating benefits for all and the continuation of railway line Glasgow-Edinburgh, which already plans to the Scottish government. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers in the next year and a decision on next steps. </seg>

<seg id="1443"> Revelations of hope the Tolokonnikova did not affect ONC of Mordovia, which believe power: In a new staff wanted to get only one human rights activist, and she has not even made the documents for the competition. </seg>

<seg id="1600"> This project is a key element of energy security of the European continent. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> &quot;South Stream is designed for diversification of export routes Russia through Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> A dispute over a contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is most of the intended for European gas Russia, increases the level of risk for regular routes, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Miller said that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries removed forever. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price, once in 2015, the whole project will begin to work. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries, further along the route of the pipeline, by the end of the year. </seg>

<seg id="1607"> The agency Rosbalt was stripped of the status of media for abuse </seg>
<seg id="1608"> On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled to annul the license registration agency Rosbalt, &quot;writes&quot; the tape.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1609"> The prison agency status of media insisted Roskomnadzor, systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> In the course of the process was created a nasty precedent: The court decided to close the media, effectively denying the right to nominate counter-arguments. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> What is the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> CJSC &quot;news agency Rosbalt&quot; was established in St. Petersburg in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Also, the agency operates offices in countries of the former USSR. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Since 2001 the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; was developed and operated as a federal information-analytical news agency. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> While the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; always took very specific niche: The nucleus of exclusive publications of the agency were (and are still) notes with a reference to sources in law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Talk about the proximity of the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Along with the fact that the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was saying and what the head of the project was Natalia Chaplin-the wife of Viktor Cherkesov&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> The role of Chaplin in leadership &quot;Rosbalt&quot; up to the end not clear: More often than not it is known as the &quot;head of the project.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonin, editor-in-chief-Nikolay Ulyanov. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The last time the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in the ratings federal media-neither the quote, nor the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In October the agency ranked 25th in the rankings of attendance of Russian media on version of clicks. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> According to the same clicks, the average daily audience of site Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views) a month-about three million unique visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Among the most popular materials over the past five months-notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of lead singer of group King and jester,&quot; pogroms in metropolitan Biryulevo. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The conflict &quot;Rosbalt&quot; Roscomnadzor started in July 2013 when entered into force of the amendment to the media law, which banned journalists abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The agency discovered the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the website of the videos (&quot; got from Krasnodar &quot;and&quot; Pussy Riot has desecrated oil rigs &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Further the parties describe differently. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Roskomnadzor based on found material has accused the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; gross and systematic violation of media law and went to court with a demand to deprive the agency&apos;s license. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In &quot;Rosbalt&quot; stated that claims of unlawful: First, the videos were not editorial content, secondly, Materne words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the videos were removed from the site. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> The agency appealed against claims of Roscomnadzor in World Court-and when 22 October 2013, the Moscow city court has accepted a lawsuit (Roskomnadzor), the examination of these complaints still continued. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> However, the magistrate decided not in favor of &quot;Rosbalt &quot;: Editor-in-chief Nicholas Ulyanov was convicted in violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles-10 thousand for each video. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Obviously, it was foreordained and the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court-to abandon the idea that the outcome could be decided even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> On 31 October, the court took the decision to annul a certificate of registration of the &quot;Rosbalt,&quot; effectively depriving the agency of mass media. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> That is not to say that the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; during this confrontation remained in solitude. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the statement in the name of the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Gerova October 10 signed 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the CPRF). </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Consider closing the magazine claimed the head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Vsevolod Bogdanov, president of the Moscow journalists&apos; union Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential human rights council, Mikhail Fedotov. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roscomnadzor even gave him some guarantee that to withdraw the license deal would not go. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The trial &quot;Rosbalt&quot; showed: Under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a mass of information in Russia today is the big question. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Gene speech turned out to be a stimulant of the synapses of </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Scientists from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Mount Sinai has discovered a protein, which &quot;gene for speech&quot; FOXP2 carries out its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The study published in Science, on the website of the magazine, you can read him a summary. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> FOXP2 gene is the first known genome, the function of which is directly associated with speech. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> To establish his role managed in 2001 thanks to the discovery of the family from several people who were unable to correctly pronounce words and sometimes even themselves did not understand each other. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Scientists have found that a family member was the FOXP2 gene, but how it performs its function, was not known. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> In the new study, the biologists have shown that at least part of their functions FOXP2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Is it thanks to another gene, srpx2. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Last was discovered as a result of the search for the factors that stimulate the formation of synapses. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> Srpx2 turned out to be one of 10 such genes, the authors found, with only its activity feet FOXP2. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> What srpx2 really affects sound, scientists confirmed in experiment on the pups. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> When animals, the gene activity was artificially lowered, they shouted when sharing with his mother. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> If the activity of the gene was restored, was recovering and the frequency of the sounds. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Previously the mice was also shown a link with the sound of the FOXP2. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> The animals, which introduced a human gene, pishchal more and at a lower rate than normal mice. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Until now, however, scientists do not know is whether the FOXP2 work and, accordingly, they managed srpx2 purely mechanical properties of education sounds or more delicate processes. </seg>

<seg id="1667"> Want luminous in the dark ice cream? </seg>
<seg id="1668"> The British entrepreneur has created the world&apos;s first glowing in the dark ice cream using jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of marine animal, to develop a food. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> He came to this idea, having read scientific article about the jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China chemically to recreate glowing protein. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Ice cream comes in reaction with language that it eats, increasing the pH of the protein and causing it to glow. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Chris says that since ice cream begins to glow when reacts to the warmth of the mouth, this means that the more you licking, the brighter it gets. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Charlie, the founder of the company producing ice cream &quot;Lisot me, I&apos;m good,&quot; says: &quot;This is an incredible thing, but still at the initial stage, if you talk about production, so for £ 200, you get about 2 grams of substance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Protein that we use in ice cream, enters the reaction with your language with a neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> So, when your mouth will warm the protein, this will raise the pH level and ice cream will start to glow. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed that ideally would represent him in Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable effect. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> This is probably the most expensive ice creams from those that I did, because the jellyfish luminescence four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> So every ball cost me about £ 140. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> But it&apos;s quite pleasant to the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Pilot Charlie Company, based in Bristol, famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste the gold. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But his next creation should be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> He said: &quot;I very much want to develop invisible ice-cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1683"> It is by definition impossible because of the refraction, caused by ice crystals, which is ice-cream, but I think we will find a way to do it. </seg>

<seg id="1892"> Syria has destroyed the equipment for from 1999 </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Syria has destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons, has acknowledged the organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This is the first phase of disarmament Damascus finished for the day of the deadline. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Until 1 November, Syria was supposed to destroy industrial and other auxiliary objects designed for warfare agents to use, reports the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> The destruction of stockpiles of toxic agents or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are in sealed repositories. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August in the chemical attack were killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time-to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more from 1999-and destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> These capacity will now be carefully watched to prevent their repairs. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The next milestone-the middle of November: This time the OPCW and Syria must agree a detailed plan for destroying existing stockpiles of toxic agents. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> Questions here a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where they will be destroyed? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will provide for this equipment? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They readily will advise inspectors new objects for testing, if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not the end of Frank. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The US believe that this attack was carried out by regular troops. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia insist that this is the hands of the Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The international community urged the Syrian leadership-in accordance with the agreement brokered by Russia-to destroy or result in inoperable all capacity for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and for filling munitions with these substances. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now, when this phase passed, the next step should be to destroy existing Syrian army from 1999. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is envisaged that Arsenal could be more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-Neringa mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored at dozens of different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> For its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to start agreed timetable of action-it is two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The head of field operations, the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally oversaw the destruction of the equipment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;They have now no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In a statement the OPCW said that inspectors had visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and has become convinced that the factories on manufacture of shells and toxic substances or destroyed, or are ruined. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The remaining two objects is too dangerous to carry out an inspection, according to the document, but the equipment was transported from there and inspected by specialists of the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> According to Smith, the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production from 1999 was &quot;particularly difficult&quot; because we had to work in conditions of the continuing conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> At the beginning of October, the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate that inspectors have so far not found-they were too busy with work. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> George Kerevan: Gap with Europe gives Scots the choice </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Another day, another scary story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> This time we warn that an independent Scotland would have to join the European zone of free movement as a condition of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Then comes the stories about the passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrionova shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits of free movement across the rest of Europe, though-what&apos;s predictable-it has not appeared in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> One pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Because Scotland now is not included in the Schengen area, the continuation of the compliance requirements will become cheap concession of Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So it&apos;s not deserving of attention the story. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And so old that she turned into a fossil: I first heard gossip about what &quot;independence means passport control,&quot; at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the retelling of the old fairytale. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why an independent Scotland should fulfill the orders of Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The real European news: The great post-war plan to unify Europe finally has stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With eurocrisis project &quot;Europe&quot; is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Across the European Union of parties opposed to the EU or the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany, the party of the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded this year alone-appeared out of nowhere and got almost five million votes at the September federal election, thus essentially replacing &quot;the Free Democrats&quot; (the equivalent of our &quot; Liberal Democrats &quot;) from the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> There was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Nevertheless, the current economic crisis became a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, has led many people to the idea that the project &quot;Europe&quot; has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments work with excessive budget deficits, this was true only for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates, favourable for German exporters, &quot; that German politicians and want to preserve. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is already at a disadvantage in terms of production capacity in comparison with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only thing saving tool-to cut wages and government spending that actively supported by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> For the current budget problems and currency lies a deeper problem of productive capacity of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of green energy measures, implemented by Brussels, is a cipher, meaning the subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times more for gas than in the US. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> This paralysis adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No freezing of salaries in the world will not stop an overwhelming victory cheap shale gas from the United States over European petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result, the brewing revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on one level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a tool to gain political legitimacy, and have already imposed their own economic policies in Europe, leaving destroyed the French economy in a mess. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> The result-right, anti-EU party Marine Le Pen of the National Front just won a decisive election, the new yardstick for the ruling Party of Socialists into third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;The Front&quot; is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote-a timely warning to British Labour that cannot proceed from the assumption that the split among the right-wing will automatically impact in favor of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among French white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use the elections to the EU next year, to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If-and it is very likely that anti-EU party will receive support in this election, this block will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The EU will not disappear, but it will once again be something vague &quot; Europe (sovereign) of nations,&quot; which enjoyed General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and a few of her dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I assume that the UK distances himself from the project, hoping to move closer to the US. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will be left without attention in the cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> In what position it leaves Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to become a region (essentially) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can protect their own economic interests, what it means, among other things, to send the Berlin and Brussels to hell in a handbasket. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in the broader European agreements on condition that we will keep its currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Cooperation with other countries-like-minded people will be easier in nonfederal Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is-ironically-the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, which received a majority of votes in 2011 due to the objections of spending cuts proposed by (Labour) and implemented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and later by the coalition with the Tories and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2043"> Early puberty: Aging earlier </seg>
<seg id="2044"> African American and Hispanic girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white, research shows. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> The physical changes do not mean that puberty close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge-a journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Whether the mother to be startled if her daughter start to form the beginnings of mammary gland and lobby hair grow at 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the children&apos;s endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes quite common among American girls and represent a new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend a lot of time, calming parents-usually it doesn&apos;t mean a rapid onset of puberty,&quot; said Koplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobby arm and underarm hair and the smell of the body, appear before girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But it was only a small shift in age menarche (the first menstruation) over the last four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;After the chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before the menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also author of &quot;early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time is the most accurate test how puberty will deepen. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> The debate about what constitutes actual puberty, but is considered premature, and when a breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth of up to 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process will slow down or suspended-that&apos;s what the pediatrician can monitor carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses the endocrinologist to prevent serious problems, such as tumors or cyst. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which ultimately could lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy based on the child&apos;s age, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> The psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The Kaplowitz cautious with drugs, but admits that &quot;the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don&apos;t want them very young daughters were pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or even about how they will cope with the issues of hygiene,&quot; said Koplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, daughter of menstruation started in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> When she came home from school fearful and upset that it first among their friends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are many theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual promises in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> Boys-and girls-puberty begins earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> The Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the largest weight is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country, African American and Hispanic girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white age. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are various explanations for. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Around the world on early puberty, apparently, affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Another mystery: Although boys hair on the face and on the pubis appear at younger ages, a trend towards full early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as the girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other physicians participating in the conference AAP, confirmed the complexity of the issue. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The appearance of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and children of nursery age. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> &quot;We need to be careful about how we define the true puberty, &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children&apos;s Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with your child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;It may mean an earlier than expected, the conversation,&quot; explained the Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you keep calm, your child is, as a rule, will react well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> The girls who bloom early, need proof that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2446"> Although she and earn S $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Indeed, demand in various parts of south-east Asia-where the amount of indebtedness of households is growing-is such that ValueMax, where she spends her deal, this week became the third Lombard, listed on the stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Credit under pledge of jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalingam), but almost as cheaply unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Usually the pawnshops in Singapore 3.99 effective annual interest rates at 17% - slightly above 15.4% offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require the credit check or evidence of a salary and can lend faster than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> So millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops as households feel the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, palpitates loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low-and middle-income people in the pawnshops, to compensate for the reduced incomes as the slowing growth of their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> This week, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, the rating agency, said the increase in family of leverage, primarily due to growth in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for creditworthiness Asian banks. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008. </seg>

<seg id="2459"> Record-high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the haste with which people lay all their belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> In Singapore, about 70% of the things are 200 Lombard points of the city-state, are gold. </seg>

<seg id="2464"> The company will finance the expansion, with 60 percent of S $66 million, attracted this week as a result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> While some lenders have caused fire critics because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeoh says that Lombard does not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> &quot;Customers lay items that they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households,&quot; she says. </seg>

<seg id="2492"> Retina question about the criminal case, said a senior official of information and public relations Southeast Lou Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Agovic. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> The Russian security forces know nothing about the group &quot;fraternal circle&quot; Novye Izvestia </seg>
<seg id="2494"> About interfax.ru writes, citing an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> &quot;After a media report that the amendments to the U.S. Treasury Olatz Arruti the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate&apos; brotherly Circle&apos;, we looked at all of the databases, but such groups not found,&quot; said the interlocutor of agency. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> In his opinion, the spread of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> As I wrote earlier, yesterday, the US Treasury has published on its website a list of alleged members of a criminal gang &quot;fraternal circle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Among them was named and the Russian singer Grigory Leps. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> It appears in the list as &quot; Grisha, posted the day before. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> With the popular Russian singer they coincide. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The exact name is Grigory Leselidze, creative name, place and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In addition, there mentioned another five people. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the United States are confident that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket transported for gangsters money according to their order. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> To this message attached to the photo of the singer and all his data, which correspond to reality. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Moreover, the lips really recently bought a house in Phuket. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> The agency said that they intend to impose sanctions against Olatz Arruti. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The man in black lists of American finance entails blocking his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with individuals living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> The assistant Olatz Arruti Maya Sarikova said that no notifications to the singer had not admitted: &quot;It is difficult to answer the question, whether it is Gregory, about which everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the United States.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2510"> All that knows the LEPs is the information media. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> Officially to him personally, there was no notification, even though I don&apos;t know whether they are in such cases. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> &quot;And, of course, all this is, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, is surprising and unexpected,&quot; she told RIA Novosti. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> According to her, in Phuket Grigory Leps no lives, but according to the U.S. Treasury, the house on the Thai island, he really is. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> She said that now the LEPs is in a long tour to the Far East and Siberia, and that news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> A black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> While the American designers roads trying to find money to repair crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly prescreened on the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> These devices, tracking a motorist progeny every mile and transmit that information to officials, are at the center of contentious attempt to upgrade the system of financing America&apos;s highways, planning authorities in Washington and the state. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to provide the right use of small boxes to track the number of miles you progeny and even, perhaps, where you go-and then use this information when drawing up tax bills. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Of the Tea Party movement in shock. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply troubled and raises a number of questions about private life. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And although Congress cannot agree, to continue or not, several states are not going to wait. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They ponder how over the next decade, you can move to a system in which drivers pay for each mile road, which they pass. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists had already taken on testing these black boxes, some of which have a function of satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> It is really necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;This is not an issue on which we can have the right to choose,&quot; said Hasan Arat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, progeny every California motorist, by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There will be changes in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The technology for this already. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds the government fund the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay at the stations. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans already do not buy so much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> The cars drive more miles on one gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> The federal tax of 18.4 cents a gallon, had not increased for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politicians don&apos;t want to raise the tax by even one penny at high petrol prices. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;A tax on gasoline is simply impossible to maintain,&quot; said Li Minnich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In his state, was recently installed on the cars 500 tracking devices for testing system family of payment. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;This would be the best alternative in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The beggar call it family user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, as with tax revenue will be able to change the nature of travel for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> The authorities in California are eyeing up this system during the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state for combating global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the transportation committee of the House, said he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Supporters of the free market in Reason Foundation also delighted from what will force drivers to pay for each mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;This is not just a tax, which will go into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The people directly pay for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This movement also is supported by two former ministers of transport in the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of family of payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The US Senate approved last year, a pilot project costing 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> However, leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who in everyday life, often many miles to get to work or to the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> A few states and cities, however, are on the way. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The greatest enthusiasm evident in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country a 5,000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will soon be paying staff for miles run instead of the tax on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada a pilot project has already been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York, he is. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois probate it on a limited basis with participation of trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> And the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studying how they will be able to conduct these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept has not received universal recognition. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can monitor every move they make. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;Concerns about the&quot; Big Brother &quot;and similar things is a big problem,&quot; said Allauddin Khan, head of the strategy and performance management in the Department of Transportation of the state of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> It was not what I wanted people. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its Web site: &quot;Very easy to convert these devices into a full-blown tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about day-to-day movements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada is one of several states where are the difficult search for low-cost technology that would have allowed the state to record progeny car miles, but no information about the place and time. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you will be able to do it, &quot; said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The search for this technology has led some agencies of the state to a small, young company in California called true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Initially the company was not engaged in assistance in tax collection. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> She sought to enter the booming market type of insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the device that they test, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded with modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more inclined to do it, if you don&apos;t track their speed and do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of the true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programs. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There is much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with giving drivers of different options. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can choose the device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they can just to abandon devices, opting instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, passing all the residents of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places we hope to sell the idea of the public, forcing the device to do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York City transportation officials are seeking to develop Kalgoorlie device, which will also receive a payment over the parking meters, to provide &quot;pay as travel&quot; insurance pool and to collect data about the speeds in real time from other drivers, motorists could use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> &quot;Motorists will be to involve the benefits that they offer,&quot; according to the document urban design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers transport systems, however, think about not whether all talk about family payment just huge distracting factor. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In urban transport commission in the Bay Area of San Francisco officials say that Congress would be very easy to overcome bankruptcy trust fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> An additional lump sum or annual tax it would be possible to charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgery, when all you have to do is to take an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on legislation and public relations. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have to worry about his private life and many other things. </seg>

<seg id="2587"> Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices, &quot; said that by February the number of cardinals-electors will likely decline. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> He said that usually the Pope calls cardinals so much need to again to bring the number of cardinals-electors to 120, and so the Cardinals over the age of 80 years, much as he would like. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> The consistory next year will have great meaning, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favor of Italy. </seg>

<seg id="2596"> He said that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis will turn to the Cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> But we have not been in this situation before-all this for us, for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Valero said that the pope was usually elevated in the post of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis &quot; full of surprises-so we don&apos;t know who he will call .&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2620"> It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of welded pipes in a month. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> After that, the decision was made about the changing profile of the factory and installation of the equipment for their production. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Already this year, shipped more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles-Lei, - said Denis Grubanov. </seg>

<seg id="2641"> At the moment, they do not and subsidies become direct spending commitments in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> With this in mind, the government&apos;s immediate priority believes support of industrial enterprises, not funding through the oil industry. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> The aid budget will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in the production. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Many business leaders had expressed concern in connection with the emerging situation in relations with oil companies. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> The subsidies on their purchased equipment is a competitive advantage in the south of Tyumen region, and its abolition will be difficult to compete on price with an average strip of Russia, where cheaper labor. </seg>

<seg id="2692"> The message: The Obama campaign headquarters considered the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2693"> According to the New York Times that top advisers President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in the election list of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> This discovery is the most spectacular stunt of all books mark Galperin and John Heilemann about campaign 2012 &quot;rates doubled: The game has changed in 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2695"> The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming books and reported on Thursday night that the next president&apos;s assistants had conducted &quot; large-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011, &quot; to assess whether the exclusion of Biden to help raise a hope for Obama&apos;s re-election. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> According to political commentator of The Times&apos;s Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely, the former head of the administration in the White House Bill daily, to assess, what effect will have a vote on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton vice president. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Possible replacement was a mystery, carefully protected in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Only six of the president&apos;s closest advisers-including daily, former head of the Obama campaign&apos;s Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David&apos;s and David Plouffe-knew that the replacement is considered. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> The book &quot; rates doubled &quot; says that the Daily was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their &quot; close personal relationship,&quot; but ultimately rejected that step, when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral roll will not improve significantly the chances Obama.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2700"> In an interview with Martin daily confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden to Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;I was actively advocated the consideration of many things, and this was one of them,&quot; said Daily newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> You must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape, so we thought: &quot;Oh my God, what do we do?.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Although the daily has described the study as &quot; necessary checks, &quot; Martin told CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper to representative that the pre-election headquarters has a lot invested in the study that will do this step the dividends on the vote. </seg>

<seg id="2707"> Although daily and said that he doesn&apos;t think that the president was &quot; in the know &quot; possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that perhaps Obama knew. </seg>

<seg id="2716"> The legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Russian Brewers in a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> According to their pricey, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level, and this is at best. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Although businessmen initially counted on growth. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> For the current year is for them badly: Sales fell 7 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> All told, the head of one of the largest brewery companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at III Annual Conference of the Institute of Adam Smith&apos;s &quot; Commodities daily demand in Russia, &quot; which just ended in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> It discussed the state regulation of the market. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, because in recent years the country has a significant strengthening regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and sales of beer-drink with a low alcohol content, &quot; told the audience the ships. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In no country is such a severe restrictions of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of more and more new illogical prohibitions that motivated alleged struggle with alcohol abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The brewer has complained that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, does not have special influence, yet constantly and there are new initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Sick of all the producers of beer struck introduced this year ban to sell alcohol in kiosks. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We just lost 35 thousand customers,&quot; said Isaac Sheps. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> For the next year, the two forecast. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Optimistic-the one that spoke the ships: Sales of this foamy drink will remain at the same level. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Pessimistic-will fall by another 2-3 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> In order to maintain their profit, businessmen forced to leave varieties, designed for mass-market consumer, the &quot;premium&quot; beers will be less, but it will be more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Meanwhile, radical consequences from falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Based on my observations, the level of alcohol remains approximately at the same level,&quot; said the doctor-narcologist Alexei hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> True, increased the proportion of patients who use the surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who &quot;got hooked&quot; on alcohol bracing drinks like &quot; The Jaguar,&quot; whereas ten years ago it was a beer alcoholism. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Each year, city authorities promise to develop more transport and transfer nodes (TPU). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Until 2020, it is planned to enter the 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> What actually turns the project, understanding our correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago, the Metro station Arbat Smolensk-Pokrovskaya line came the construction fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The caption read, that the arrangement&apos;s funding. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> It was all very strange, because from Smolensk no terrestrial transport does not stop and, therefore, to change for him. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> To get to the nearest trolley bus stops on the Garden Ring, we have to overcome about 130 meters, including ground moving through the Carminucci Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now the Smolensk almost all over. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Faded flower stall, dismantled a booth for newspapers, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by paving. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> And the whole transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transport-transfer sites are planar and capital, &quot; explains in the press service of the Moscow Department of Transport. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No capital TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> And planar suggest the construction of car parks, shopping facilities, hindering the movement of passengers, creating small architectural forms and landscaping. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Actually, Planar TPU not even engaged in the transportation, and professional blogostroika from Department of the major overhaul of the city of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Transport is not necessarily a complicated design, &quot; explains director of the Institute of Economics and transport policies of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes enough of the roof over his head and scoreboard ringing time of arrival of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Here, for example, the Metro Moscow has recently opened fully fledged planar transfer site. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Even without awnings, but ride car parks and the scoreboard showing when the next bus. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of a number of officials write the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Back in 2011, the city was planning to build all the 151 node, of whom 59 capital construction. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now in plans up to 2020 are up to 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> Of them 150 promise to pass more this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although the town has the program of development of TPU, not any qualitative criteria, &quot; stated Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization &quot; the city and transport.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: First-time transplantation, secondly-convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all, the ability to change the type of transport, not going out into the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow when the development of TPU sometimes goes the other way around. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Example &quot;VDNH&quot; Metro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Earlier commuter buses with Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance MMS. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now they stop suffered on the opposite side of the street Yaroslava astronauts. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Farther from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential home. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> A gift that residents didn&apos;t want bus station and complained in every possible instance. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With capital TPU in Moscow is somehow not immediately asked. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them began to build five years ago, the hotel Planernoe. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The project is called was to be a model. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And really it was an example of how the transfer site, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, here there are the tourists for buses, the Canopy not to come from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> True, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and 203 in the Moscow TPU places have not fundamentally. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> As others pushed away from the Metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> But under the trade more left. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> One of only 32 of the clothing store, and generally there are almost everything-from the stone to the dealership. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well, in fact, suddenly of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> We have, when build capital TPU, somehow always turns out shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot has decided to give to the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor of the TPU Planernoe among marked on the floor of parking spaces is brisk trade. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The vegetables, spices, jeans, non-speech and the guards, viciously Palaguachi on our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Transfer the site finally turned into a bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The fact is that before the Metro Planernoe. It was the market, but it demolished. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> And in the prefecture traders took pity and allowed to intercept parking funding. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Still, because of high prices there are always empty. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The same ridiculous that the market demolished in order to build in its place... a new painting TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> This is the castle. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> The Metro Kaluga distance approach from the lobby of the Metro bus was 50 meters, &quot; said Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After the construction of a shopping center, ostensibly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> To sit in the bus, you need to go through the whole shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to work around it under the open sky. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> However, construction on Planernoe and Kaluga region will soon appear in the neck. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> In mid-September, the City Planning Commission and City Council approved planning decisions for the first eight Capital TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground level. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> The monster will grow from the underground &quot;Ring,&quot; it will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Representatives of Railway Stations Directorate RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU from Metro, already told journalists: In future rise will be located shops, hotels and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> While officials say that a lot of parking places will take from one third to one half of the square. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Take for example, the people&apos;s garages. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> For example, the garage on 258 cars, which has recently built on the international street, is 8015 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So, for parking 2.6 thousand cars &quot;- Razumovskaya&quot; will need on the order of 80,000 &quot;squares..&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2801"> This is less than a third of the machine that there are going to build. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Let one or two floors will go on all the tourists for buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate. </seg>

<seg id="2864"> The corporation Bombardier, a Canadian maker of aeroplanes and trains, was announced on Thursday about a reduction in net profit by 15 percent and reduced the number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> Located in Montreal company Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information about whether the ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation to the next September. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> After the first flight of prototype aircraft, about one and a half months ago, he was flying only three times, that raises questions about whether stage of tests on schedule. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> The results had not fallen short of forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Cameron&apos;s Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its estimate of &quot;above average &quot; to average because of the belief that the shares of restricted growth in the next quarter or two. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> &quot;Although the decline in the number of supply aircraft was largely predictable, we, of course, disappointed by the revenue of the transport department,&quot; said Doerksen in stock market review. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as the continuation of the flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced about new orders, we expect that the market will become more skeptical about the program. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The first prototype aircraft was presented in March and for the first time flown in September after several months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But firm CSeries orders so far, not too much-177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of tests to verify the claims of the company on fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner. </seg>

<seg id="2878"> &quot;The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; said Boduan during a conference call, adding that the downtime of the aircraft were scheduled ground tests and software updates. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> All the manufacturers are planning test in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> We decided to carry out the first flight and to have a break for updates, so we did. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> So will occur throughout the flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> The second of five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow, as reported by the company. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customers will be able to start exploitation of the CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bombardier said that it evaluates the term of commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> &quot;This slow pace of flight tests-though, apparently, and consistent with domestic schedule Bombardier-underpins our view that the commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, &quot;.&quot;said Doerksen. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> The portfolio of orders in the aerospace unit was $32.9 billion as of September 30, December 31. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> &quot;In the aerospace field results were consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor,&quot; he said. </seg>
