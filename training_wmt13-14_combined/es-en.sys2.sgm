<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to obstruct the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, the Brennan Center considers this a myth and argued that electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die from the fall of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Indeed, the lawyers Republicans have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new provisions shall adversely affect the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In that sense, these measures will undercut in part the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in the same vein a majority of Governments Americans enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the process of registration or ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, during the year 2011 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws reduce periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and withdraw their right to vote of citizens with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no state american demanding that voters submit an identity card with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The State of Indiana was the first to claim it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In recent years, the authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, citizens japanese-americans do not have a universal identity card, such as the card of the Seguridad Social. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., 21 million people of voting age, have no identity document with photo issued by a government agency in your state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But often, obtaining the identity document required costs more than a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, a 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, an 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there are still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In many states, students, voters that more vote for candidates Democrats, may not use the identity document with photo issued by his institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Moreover, those same states authorize the members of the clubs fishing or hunting tend to vote Republican parties to use the documents issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 no state demanded proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state to submit such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are citizens japanese-americans. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures seek, clearly, limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It appears that two of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, lawmakers Republicans supported in 2011 certain laws abolishing registration of voters on the same day of voting in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service of aid to who that to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the 2004 general election, the campaigns of registration of voters contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of registration of new voters into 2010 compared with the year 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states advocating the reduction of the period to vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of electors who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for more than 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These do not represent more than an 11% of voters, which amounts to a 24% of citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters have opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this sense, the governors Democrats have blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Ministerio Fiscal of the Estados Unidos intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was, in part, limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law that required the submission of a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics Democrats denounced the partisan nature of laws that have been voted, because it is clear that aims to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Centro Brennan 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed in order to achieve the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One thing is certain: These new provisions shall adversely affect the rate of participation. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this regard, the measures will undercut in part the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Detection of prostate cancer: Going the test or not shy? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test presents, sometimes, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which decides unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is a reason enough to make hesitate to men, already reluctant itself, should be done on whether or not screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> How Going the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked advice to two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies in the United States was detected a high rate of infections among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make recommendations firm. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, with a follow-up to the 12 years, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if not the detection test has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend, therefore, the test at age 50, or 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of African-American origin have a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. It should offer all possible options and not necessarily treat cancers and prostate cancer that do not undermine long-term life, in which case it should opt instead for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive or presents a risk to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> We find increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should be treated or not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend that you do the test in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether it should be the test or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that lets you evaluate the pros and cons of PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (for the moment only in English, but it will offer translations shortly) at the following address: Http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe for preventing cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of investigations, the adoption of healthy life habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent a 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;if anyone smoke, this rate would rise, at least, 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokeswoman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others remain completely inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Society Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Tobacco is linked with 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Damaging to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> A non-fact hopeful: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight a </seg>
<seg id="87"> The fat and obesity also favor the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;research shows that the practice of regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; they added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, they climb the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The products of charcuterie should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat for smoking, curing or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins those </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between the complex vitamin and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> However, for the moment their research are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Segú the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them found a decrease the risk of prostate cancer, in another what it was noted it was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been able to determine clearly. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Furthermore, M. Beaulieu insists the importance of talk about the concerns and family background of each with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;do the test of detection not cause cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs bosón in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs bosón generated a great shock last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed, in effect, that this bosón is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> What is more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model: Our best or &quot;less bad&quot; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But to physicists is not entirely clear that it is Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that looks very much like bosón of Higgs predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week in a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although it is still more data to be completely secure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be few. We will see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this great world, a law widespread and inescapable that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way infringe that rule and not try too, because end up becoming damage. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although physics of particles is a very complex world, has also demonstrated that there is an act of this,: The principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if are in the same &quot;quantum state &quot;; a&quot; state &quot;that comprises, grosso modo, of some of its characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The particles physicists classified into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not by this principle, which means that can be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Laboratorios Berkeley which, incidentally, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: The taverns, that we do not here, and the &quot;particles of force,&quot; for which the great forces of nature is spreading and with whom bosón the Higgs would be somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosones, it should be stressed here, are not the bichos exotic that we could believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if she can read this chronicle, thanks to a bosón remarkably banal: The photon, or particle of light &quot;which acts as a&quot; messenger &quot;of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electrical load accelerates or changes direction, &quot;desordena&quot; the electromagnetic field in that very environment; a bit like when launched a stone in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this &quot;disorder&quot; was born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon, i.e., one of the bosons &quot;carriers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the bosón of Higgs, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be &quot;messy&quot; for this bosón appear. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it takes to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> It requires a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km circumference!) to reach such levels of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Indeed, not all particles or all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like the magnets, they do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will not be never by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what &quot;could bring&quot; all of these investigations?, asks the Lady Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, in addition, that physicists escrutinen the differences between observations and predictions of the MS MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For their part, many fervent wish that they are, because the smallest difference could open the door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that tape certain holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, admittedly, is still huge gaps, as does not propose any explanation regarding the seriousness (UPS) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of matter in the Universe (another UPS!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we found no such differences in the CERN until the moment. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact of </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of these investigations in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> To see: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratory is not suspected in all the revolution that their jobs would. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Entreveían the scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, as has already said the physical Willard Boyle, who worked in laboratories Bell, where the laser was invented in 1960, and established the first continuous laser (the first were pulsados) in 1962, the principle the laser was rather considered a &quot;laboratory equipment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And also, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a sensor of light in 1969 in the course of his investigation in the matter of optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Despite that it was not in their original intention, this sensor is now &quot;eye&quot; for all digital devices of the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC want to necessarily transform our lives, but you never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> In his Commission die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be joined again soon as it prepares a draft law. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, within that domain essential, there is still much to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to see it close. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Sr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a reprieve of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I had been given five years of life, but I&quot; ve already been seven so, &quot;he recounts, made a passes, lying on his bed in the middle of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, who arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;but it is always a shock, we cannot be ready for this,&quot; continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease has wreaked havoc: A huge weakness that prevents him go to the bathroom and even eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting in front of an apetitoso lunch, acceptance resigned to help it eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, even to smile, to talk to strangers who devote attention, will bring drugs and provide a bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;my greatest wish is that I cure diarrhoea, is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found remedy this wrong. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;in the course of our lives we learn that a man doeth pee standing,&quot; recounts Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the centre Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Return to his childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;that depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of the majority of the people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All patients who enter the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provide care &quot;curative&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The biggest fear of the Sra. A., 89 years, is dying &quot;conscious and drowned out&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made him discover to their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have some good kids,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I no longer are more wishes in this life,&quot; says, before accepting that you put a mask to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And, in the coming days, a last visit of his son who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid to feed. </seg>
<seg id="174"> They are palliative care being given when there is nothing we can do more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To help make his death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for every 700 people. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Is very little, because we know that we will all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the centre. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Either a level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The moribund are offered of shenanigans by mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> To diabetics they are no longer controls its rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The death is part of the everyday. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we serve a beer Mr. X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son is finished beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;we help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; recounts Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever be the same. </seg>
<seg id="187"> The next to a man of 94 years to savoring its last meeting in the courtyard, well placed between its pillows while all beben to their health, a young of 36 years in a tragic tragically, surrounded by their parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;six months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age suffering from cancer,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted in the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care centre. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the society of palliative care to address of the Grand Montréal, specialise almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this large relative lack health care in Quebec what makes many doctors specialising in palliative care they fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to the DRA. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;recently,&quot; he said, &quot;I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Spain suffering great pain has not done enough to alleviate it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die alone because they do not receive proper care. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already low ebb when he left a tiring chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> &quot;when i told my oncóloga that wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that gave it much wishing to stop fighfing&quot;, has penalty. </seg>
<seg id="201"> &quot;however, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="202"> There are no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> The DRA Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients requiring die welcome to their attendants do not have served them in their demands once they have been relieved their pain thanks to a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to the treatment of pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep in the patient until the time of his death, whether sporadically or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the disease is not relieved to have the possibility to have that palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved say all the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want to euthanasia,&quot; but &quot;I wish to alleviate. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The completion of this reporting has been possible thanks to a journalism scholarships research institutes of health of Canadá. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals of wide in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, employers of BTP political parties, fundraisers and experts from the mafia italië count, day after day, what know of a formidable &quot;system&quot;, which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> A &quot;industry&quot; that went too expensive to taxpayers quebequenses, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;it is curious how the system is sprayed once we have got to big media&quot;, observes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former Chief of Police of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation of fraud related to contracts of roads in Quebec, the liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had not consented to delay. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;report Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry it would have saved billions of dollars in contracts&quot;, containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;has already made fall to two mayors,&quot; he adds, while hoped to reach &quot;demonstrate the existing manoeuvring behind individuals.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="226"> Has been formally accused engineers of the road network of Montreal and entrepreneurs of origin italian-style, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused shock to explain to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; variety of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He paid over three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> M. Zambito distributed money to left and right during the years 2000, providing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Admitted, also having organized a colecta of illegal funds for the ex-viceprimera liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Inflation in the cost of contracts of </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked effectively. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it well before the commission: In ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes by companies in the construction sector, for a total of $736.000, all in exchange for contracts of sewage whose inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road network have admitted that received money by inflating invoices between 30% and 40% of false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, M. Tremblay accused of having deliberately turn a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to an enormous crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected political Montreal that sounded the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, was opposed from 2010 to the sale of city land acquired for $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to the promoters in the housing boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was dirty money </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation was eventually take place, it ensures that pulls &quot;by a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> He adds that the process is &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning the wounds but would require a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that the dubious practices are not repeated. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> And regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but is anxious above all by the role of the &apos;elected politicians aware of the ruse. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="246"> Judging by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was allocated to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, observes: &quot;I have said that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebecois government is proposing to limit to $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;while not strictly limit the election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> Advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and financing of the parties: &quot;we cannot fall lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, we will rebuild the house with a more solid footing, with more checks and laws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes tarnished international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who are rían to look in the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;the PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How would explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Could be explained by a collection of individual conscience, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Have come great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> I advance from day to day at his side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff I also has contributed much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> In a match, that is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very fast in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not acaloro. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early in the centre of preformación NPI Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Going to get the benefit of competition caught by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Those recruited this summer are accustomed to the disputing parties of very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> That makes a player like me has want to fight and publicise everything. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much in terms of my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is backed by Mayor Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> How Ancelotti is the man who needed the team? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technical. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, there is no one in League 1 and is among the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that will be other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had a conversation very comforting with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence in me also explains my good performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyon we have removed the post of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we still in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarterfinals with style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are trying to reach as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, you can do anything. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have much to say in response to many and very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to start, finish the first of our league against the Porto to qualify for the quarterfinals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can become a great European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> On the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its media for this project. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, we are going to invest all our efforts in on us that title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season we do not far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were a disappointment, since contábamos with the optimum conditions to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Terminamos with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, the Montpellier, had a far rather better. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year I think that will be the good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams as the Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have arms to llevárnoslo. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect more PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal to expect much of us if we believe in what has been invested in the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We have accepted completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After that ganáramos 4-0 at home to Troyes, which is still with things that reprocharnos is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what more expected the people. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 all the weekends. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to launch a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for quarterfinals, and they have also invested a lot! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In view of the sums invested, imaginaríamos with 15 points of advantage to the day. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship of Francia. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, had been &quot;driven&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up leading the trophy. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better to say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He has come to prove that it is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And has demonstrated in all the equipment by which has past that is a great player, a star world. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects to the men which has around them. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> That pushes others to increase their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was very excited to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate time of the game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there, and I strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today achievement play good matches in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is what I expected from my baptism with the &quot;blue&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we now have exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What vision you have the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the &quot;blue&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is getting results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Are well positioned in the group of qualification for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc achieved its goal of mechanics for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead to the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The draw (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the groundwork? </seg>
<seg id="346"> That game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each one fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, had not lived a game like that in my entire career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Contrary to the current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, the transactions identified and the burdens of processing between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: The conviction that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol for change in the way of BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files of equals. </seg>
<seg id="353"> There have been nearly 200,000 transactions with 15,000 computers of the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And nearly a thousand web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to approach the ten dollars (contributions are censan in the ods-website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> It is nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> In it, he described the bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency with more success&quot;, &quot;which compete with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot;, used to move forward in a video game and that they can win playing or you can buy (and sometimes even redeem). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But in any all a central authority controls and trafficking changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With the bitcoin, all the network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users are is in fact between two addresses in the form of e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user may choose a different direction for each payment, thereby guaranteeing the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this transaction is signing electronically through a system of double encryption key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins show in the book of accounts public, which is broadcast across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This goes through the resolution of a challenge launched mathematician to computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege to add additional that line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> This is a phase of cubed file, i.e., processing of a large file in a digital numerical and unique footprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;catch&quot; the new transaction and add a number of &quot;chop up&quot; the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once that is found that number, the other nodes readily verified that is good. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is found then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the mark. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, for committing a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than 10 minutes), the network just accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, because both have different footsteps. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer to resolve the challenge is 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but are divisibles until the cienmillonésimo, which leaves a large margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is also reveals in every increase in the number-crunching power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;the ruling does not affect the same protocol,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, which has just launched Paymium, a company in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB has in mind also the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this service anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The actors of weight as Wikipedia reject payments of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the platform Wordpress, the accept. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analysed the book of records and showed that about 80% of bitcoins not circulating. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November we launched the &quot;giant cuts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;is changed 30,000 dollars&quot;, is regocija Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of a book on this pedagogical currency, believes in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Its system, Paytunia, equates to a credit card (in real money) or a payment by mobile without contact, but used Bitcoin to validate transactions, so they are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier, moreover, manages its identity and, therefore, may remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement in the shops, which do not have to install new terminal or software used be. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Simply have to provide an address to a phone to &quot;photograph and recognize,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, which ensures have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a movement of general review of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;it will take a while for Bitcoin be imposed, but in 2013 could be a change,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> Moreover, in its report, the ECB BCE revalue rehabilitate various risks, now considered senior, in the event that currency success. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We out of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan, Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army regain possession of its territory and that Afghans can choose their future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished particularly to the Afghan farmers, who have seen terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, the wounded and the maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as in the days of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Want to defend its traditions, old and archaic, even if its causes join the jihad, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they are no longer when Westerners become more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops in the Nijrab base, which i from the top of the hills planted with almond almendros thanks to the appropriations French, was done by order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no influx of non-taliban in Kabul since the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed since their irresistible between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then vacuum and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Its takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of their farmers are overwhelmed by the organization al-Qaeda, but their situation is no better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old Mujahideen, the current government and the Taliban current share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main personalities of the anti-Soviet anti-soviet returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become speculators with government land for resale such as solar refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the American pair of massive outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are discredited; most of them have not fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people, as I heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American generosity: The flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have lived the modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan and has seen its advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With around 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul account now with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the state schools are full of both girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Will give work to those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties nor to the corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opposition, are money-grabbing mobile phones. The television and its folletines turks who presented a modern world has great admirers around the country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> You seen as legitimate authorities who want to lead the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle is concerned about whether to reconstitute the provincial militia, which would flee the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States had wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister who has existed since the 1964 constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The president Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the planned elections in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, the country relies on foreign aid since the 1950s or even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has restored its services, has not been fixed no dam or have been repaired irrigation systems important. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported, and is not produced nothing except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to the private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary governmental control. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Spread the rumour that Afghanistan had immense wealth of mining. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that only added to the feeling that Westerners were there to seize. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to extract minerals iron or copper the ground and without means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already have almost abandoned copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excaven the immense site búdico and remain there as employers most important in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the country largely dependent on imports and exports, restore its normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The French troops departed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new treaty of cooperation provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: Girls&apos; schools, colleges of children, a department of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the fields military, legal, health and agricultural and support for the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, with the aim of trying to &quot;win the hearts and spirits&quot; and make the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions match, a service &quot;civilian and military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and did bring through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of towns of mountain. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Those jobs, chocoholics to get local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurgency irrigation, wells, water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we will leave as I recall after two billion euros of military expenditures? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often located more than 2,000 metres high. </seg>

<seg id="451"> A Constitution with forceps in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives provsionally full powers, he decided to play by up. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote their final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Only a week ago, the head of state had given two months to the Assembly to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And nearly two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, amended a number of times, which weakens the institutional stability and legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has not done more than increase the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the president continues his mind-boggling &quot;autocratic&quot; and &quot;betraying his word&quot; and &quot;flouting the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> By its supporters, ensures that this is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the next 15 days should organize a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, forcing the Brothers to renounce his project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>

<seg id="465"> It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> The majority of liberals not went to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their points of view. </seg>

<seg id="483"> &quot;for now, there is no specific religious involvement. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil status. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who have been working in this text are not members but academics, some of them trained in the French system, &quot;says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding the article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> &quot;we refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civilian judges competent to pronounce on top of all this. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;the big and powerful&quot; will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for the language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that would bring the law on the examination, have already appeared in the country scammers timadores dealing with licences &quot;false&quot; </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most are citizens of countries of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> His only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> From December 1 enters into force a law, according to which each immigrant labour should conduct a review to check their knowledge of the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, institutions of community services, domestic services and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, as promised in the Federal Service for Immigration, the exams will be mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will not be sufficient to pay the consideration of the language, if not also of Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> The knowledge of the language must confirm even to receive and renew the work permit. </seg>

<seg id="597"> Will not be subject to this law persons who succeeded in obtaining education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>

<seg id="599"> The network of centres examiners will be hosted by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher learning Russian. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants may run in evidence in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 centres of this type. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Service for Immigration. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But human rights defenders, long before the law entered into force, achieved many times do this question to the press: What will bring this into reality? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will bring direct knowledge of the language, both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, respond the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;labour slavery.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people speak today on the defense of the rights of immigrants labour, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of Servicio Federal de Inmigración de Rusia in Tayikistán. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The defence of their rights must begin before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of selection organised to solve the problem of immigrant workers in a 90% of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical supervision. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant to be sentenced to find unscrupulous people, under the pretext of help, &quot;my a&quot; paid &quot;to a grisly and close covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We received a number of complaints of our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;in his homeland they promise one thing, but you are deluded, deprived of their passports, wages are not paid promised,&quot; confirms the head of the Directorate of labor immigration, the immigration of Tajikistan, Sharipov Tolib. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Don &apos;t be angry, jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country to which seek to go, but also in their own language write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not their fault but his own misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive primary education normal. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is due to their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to speak of dress them up, calzarlos and buy back to school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> To reach adolescence, these kids venture to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if not know the language, recognize them. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;you feel humiliated and bottom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, when it comes to the law on language rights defenders point out an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If they do not have that status, there will be no consideration and, accordingly, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of immigrant workers still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;welcome or banned the way to strangers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors say that receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 billion to sixteen thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> However, a false registration can be done quickly and with only a thousand five hundred rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, are not registered and cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;we are calling for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,&quot; he commented to reporters the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;we &apos;re going, don&apos; t be stingy, bought a painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> The first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only records of immigrants can be false. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several licences &quot;false&quot; knowledge of the language already have been seized by officials of Servicio Federal de Inmigración. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The falsified documents had been printed in color printers standard. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, came into the hands of the new owners not as gift: Every immigrant, who wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two and a half times more expensive than the process of procedure, which will cost the worker immigrant three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption in order that the &quot;qualifications&quot; to buy, merge government officials and human rights defenders. </seg>
<seg id="637"> So far, the authorities can promise to immigrant workers that had not been able to successfully pass the test the first time more time to study the basic course of the language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian, will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal trade of arms </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with weapons is quite small </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Ministry of the Interior intends to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to gun owners of civilian use. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the reaction of the government to recent incidents: Tighten shootings during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the tiananmen initiated by the lawyer moscow Dimitri Vinográdov, in the poor seven people lost their lives. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to prohibit the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raising the minimum age for handgun license, 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea was supported by the head of the committee of the Duma in security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised reforms in the law on the possession weapons will be taken to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not all feel happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &quot;hardline policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> The network has appeared in an open letter, whose authors, representatives of several social organizations of gunmen, demand that it desist from such measures of thoroughness &quot;meaningless&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the BBC news service, the lawyer criminalista Vasiliy Lésnikov. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to total of 238 crimes recorded for the same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are confident that a more stringent law in the field of weapons for civilian use will not be a drawback for which the offender is directed to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, in his words, in Moscú you can find any weapon at low price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, in the Ministry of Interior affirms that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: From factories to officers </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market is supplied through several channels. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main channels are years, said retired Col. Viktor Baranets, who for 10 years worked at the Ministry of Education and the High Staff. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Screenshot of the website that accepts orders of weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first, &quot;vestige of the army or military&quot;, ie the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;the weapons were hurtadas by officers Russians and Caucasians,&quot; said Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The next type of &quot;black weapon,&quot; the stolen by criminals and members of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that this will include weapons hurtadas of the police and those stolen directly by officials of the bodies of law enforcement. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal weapons go on sale from the military arsenals. </seg>
<seg id="661"> In many military arsenals often had explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;there are versions demonstrated that some fires were caused question to cover the lack,&quot; says a exmilitar. </seg>
<seg id="663"> According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put its sand granite. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;now have proliferated private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons illicitly to the black market, including Moscow,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> A source more of the black market is smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Large amount of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;there have their own production, at times, and it has formed a mob that has organized the flow of weapons,&quot; explains the former military. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Where the weapons come from? </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts have calculated what is the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A report on this topic was developed in 2011 by the Center for analysis and planning of governance. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminológica literature and data from public access portals that thematically revolve around weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The great majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, from the armed forces and security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of weapons on the black market has come there &quot;because of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; the report says. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of cases steals for the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the &quot;illegal&quot; archaeology. </seg>
<seg id="675"> The dependent on one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his name not be mentioned, said that the weapons found by excavadores illegal for the purchase nobody a long time because they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often, he said, suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a game. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Through some alférez, the supplier buys a unit, for example a gun TT. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The eliminate the registration and go over the fence. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;he keeps the weapon to the city and the sells to 900 euros per unit with two chargers&quot;, tell us </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;but, of course, the police this aware of all the issues, as well as periodically, when we comply with the plan of discovery of offences, carried out test purchases to merchants of illegal weapons,&quot; adds the clerk. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;as in a luxury boutique&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The seller and the buyer often be found through known. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;I visited websites and blogs until a sort that I proposed it to the platform&quot; Begovaya &quot;, where would a man that I would lead to a&quot; esquinita &quot;where we could negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the weapon, I was only there. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="686"> &quot;to get a gun need a friend who have contacts,&quot; said the clerk of the store. &quot;I have a friend as well, but I am not very confident it.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="690"> Novices are searching for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s, when preparing to publish an article on this topic. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The schemes, in his words, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> She got a photo album where there was no &quot;all&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, not offer no mistake: Everything you can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the salesman the forest, where we put a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure you that the gun shoot well, we began to negotiate,&quot; describes the procedure, the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shop of sofas </seg>
<seg id="699"> Web search engines lead to sites and groups of &quot;Vkontakte&quot;, which offers buy weapons &quot;for different purposes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> For this is not require any document or personal encounters. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;it is enough to have a certain amount of money,&quot; write in the title of the ad buy a gun or a machine gun. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="702"> There, users make their orders and put questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> What they sell to minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;without permission, of course,&quot; asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling preserved). </seg>

<seg id="708"> Military commentator Viktor Baranets exmilitar and </seg>
<seg id="709"> &apos;ve heard these systems: Generally, the website is registered outside the scope of the laws russian. </seg>
<seg id="710"> The people orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer makes the payment through an ATM. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;in response, he sent a photo and instructions to know where he is hiding the weapon,&quot; recounts press secretary for the NGO &quot;The right to weapons,&quot; Dmitri Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Viktor Baranets said that if it makes an order online, one is left without a gun and put them in jail. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of websites and capture two hands to those who want to purchase firearms. </seg>

<seg id="717"> In the illegal purchase of firearms, according to the experts, you can spend of 100 to 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitri Kislov of the ONG &quot;El right to weapons&quot;, a Makarov pistol you can acquire by 100-300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> It must wait a month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="720"> It is sent from the military stores by the heads. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to official statistics of the ministry, in comparison with the period enero-octubre 2011, the total number of these offences in Rusia decreased by 7%, what constitutes 22.900, and the number of cases identified of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> Go on strike employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in &quot;McDonald&quot; s &quot; </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, the United States has started a wave of protests against low wages paid in supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as McDonald &apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, &quot;&quot; Wendy&apos; s &quot;and&quot; Kentucky Fried Chicken &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For now, nobody dares to say whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or if it meant losing forces and amansarse in its early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The actions of protest enjoy the support of unions and a series of leftist ONG. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the modest increase wages received by employees of Walmart and the system of fast-food, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> How Forty and six cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The shares began the week, after the day of Acción of Gracias, the so-called &quot;Viernes Negro&quot;. That day, in Estados Unidos coomenzaba the orgy of cuts that captured a million inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some workers of the corporation Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed picket lines in protest alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are directed to people of modest incomes and modest. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the major supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many workers underpaid of Walmart buy only in the work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and the range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low price, in part because pays little to their workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Recent also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of hoists or scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> That &quot;Viernes Negro&quot; participants of the event demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to $100 monthly. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker Walmart, which receives $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the company $3.2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart placed wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In a year they spend a ridiculous amount of $has more of what they earn now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart comment satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that no loss caused to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The &quot;Black Friday&quot; extended in their tents from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, their tills carried out the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of left-wing Huffington Post, who left his job &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart and that the protest had not been &quot;another public relations conjuring trick&quot;, organized by the union of workers. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Box free!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in Nueva York, in which the objectives were not precisely the department stores Walmart (which in this progressive city would not have them, and so for now there are none), but the &quot;McDonald &apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> You McDonald &apos;s says that sells billions of portions, and then even te granted sick leave and no te pay for your work honest! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7,25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants are increasing with time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York $8.90 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody wins less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost one-quarter of teenagers us flowed through the McDonald &apos;s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly stumbling block in some interviews with workers at McDonald &quot;s who complain that they have to live this salary, and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal there is a comment remark the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning of Thursday in the McDonald &quot;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers, fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, or that they double its current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the fast food industry is believe trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits the administration of failing to this right and punish activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, rarely the administration provides les with life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy to trade unions cover the food sector rápid. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is the excessive staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant, </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action took place in the middle of a rally in the McDonald &quot;s near Times Square, involving several local Democratic politicians, particularly the member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said:&quot; McDonald &apos;s says it is selling billions of portions, and then even gives you a hospital or pay you for your honest work. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The protesters received the support of other prominent Democrats in New York, for instance of candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must support workers in the fast-food sector to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity that it deserves every New York.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described by the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest demonstration of this kind in American history of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But she participated only a few hundred people, not even all of them were employees of fast food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not clear yet whether this will spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;for now, trick the brain is not so easy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The issue of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the beginning of the summer, in its annual conference Google showed a model in movement and later, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the corresponding patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, a conversation with the head of the group of 3D interactive 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, is dilucidó that for scientists of the carrier, the glasses because they belonged to a bygone past. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dedicated to human-to-computer interaction, but also try to extend the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For now, humanity at large mass has been caught in the stage of work with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes plays with the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, since all interested in the gesture control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what the future holds? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite that Kinect has led the interaction of the physical level, much of it still happens in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good yet. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, we work in truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including the design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Should be ridding the world of the computer to our, physicist, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a form more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First, the devil with these fools of virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the control by voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A detail very popular, but is not believed to overestimate? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - Of course he cannot be considered a panacea, remains to resolve the issue of privacy, since they are not always want others to know about our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think in gestures, but not in feral movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In addition, gestures were captured not by the house of the device, but by a pulsera that the movement of their bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For now is very big, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - how is that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how do I ask you to pass this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You will speak and show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - O is, you want to coerce users to adapt to what can or cannot do in this moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine with precision the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These can be, for example, laser sensors, already providing a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you to the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Les absence resolution, depth or something more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to obtain 8 megapíxeles at the speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the issue is not in the Megapixel, but in the quality of the womb and in depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this point of view, all current technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work for designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Or is that we have to remember not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are pretty dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory in Redmond, did a sensor contact with retardation adjustable indictment of 1 to 100 ms and worthy of mention that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction hombre-máquina. </seg>
<seg id="819"> To it would be very useful for my work equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact for which the frames per second are more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - Y is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect now has three &quot;chambers&quot;, one of which is indeed the issuer of infrared and the second the recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third camera is in fact a simple sensor the pitch visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially, more number of cameras could solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be good to create a flexible analogue Kinect, toying with the curvature of location of cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - By what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted their glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you think that, from the point of view of daily use of technology of augmented reality glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, moving all the time hold a smart phone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: The best option would be an augmented reality &quot;transmutable&quot; when, on the basis of a platform for cloud, you could spend of the glasses the smartphone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also its weakness: Based on an augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on virtual items together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects virtual holographic in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem with this idea that the critics often noted: There is no tactile response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers prepares his group to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my conferences I often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in quality of support for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It has the touch perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really aimed to provide tangibilidad to these &quot;images in the air.&quot; for example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams aimed at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to the one feels if somebody was soplándole at their fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets for the wrist that affect the nervous terminations of the fingers, this also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Do you think that he feels it seems that should feel at the moment that sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - Esa is a good idea, we have not tried yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge with which have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in an a very small space creates which goes to an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the velcro-type of treadmills (not the cardio gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> By now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, there is still that work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes it attractive working with virtual reality to the researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Personal taste subjective in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;avant-gardeness of St. Petersburg&quot; dedicated to the people who are in front at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list of the best are brilliant figures from the art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: Often found recognition in Europe without Russia even know. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found close to the Russian Museum, Summer Garden or in meetings of fashion and inaugurations. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever it is exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilósofos he of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the vanguardismo of San Petersburgo of the late 80 - the early 90. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Moreover, it is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, took their hands on a organillo and became the recording of St. Petersburg, as it has matured to do so difficult role, for its bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why go through the city dressed in red and yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the red because I am a fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society, everything that is not a little gray suscita aggressiveness and agitation of properties nothing good. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are directed to start a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The history of my provocative actions are an invitation to the debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - when comprendiste that must be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In an exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where they displayed my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of older artists unofficial had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprendidos. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I made friends with artists of the new wave, with the subsequent they face in Gaza and front, which led to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and ended the new wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I sumí in the theatre for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not by the letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this is gathered in your clinic of art... - For me it was important to be in the cultural centre of St. Petersburg, where you should bring together the best creative minds. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I ocupé a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reforms, there was a musical music club, a club bohemio, the home of the bohemia bohemian San Petersburgo. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way in which Schnur brought the project to &quot;The ear of Van Gogh. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and his friends sang songs light under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to touch live, became &quot;Leningrado&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the days of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training the received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; the &quot;Griboedov Club, the remains of the Art Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and regulars. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was &quot;La people of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;artist of the Year&quot; I was elected I, thus ended my conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In these new times is not easy work; I am a man who likes to the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our times it is easy to be popular, but the culture and the popularity are separate. One can be popular but very little cult. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - There are in your work something recognizable. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the present and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I &apos;m going to make a presentation scheduled, &quot;The Russian Museum in clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I was sociable before, but now be so is painful and terrifying. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns everything is embadurna and the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world through compulsory totalitarian and a change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now you are for the clothes, looking abroad, but not in the interior of the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps this person is not due or give the hand, but spit on him in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception be removed when you change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - A little we saw in the role of urban recording. - A cultured city must have a hero as well. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than I to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Well but the best commercial art could be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Ahora the commercial art should be scrupulously, sweet, take tact. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before the people are comprised in flocks, the bohemios wanted one thing, the simplones other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have been divided into microcomunidades, it is hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket hundred dollars to taste at all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> There are now to think who you want to taste. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each hero worship has its 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by the thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - Van to see the abandoned, there is the sexo-social area. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event are 300 people, 10 thousand never come. As a result, less management, less money, all languisheth. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have to my fans, the most important thing is not deceive them, not lose what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young was such a collector the paintings that he had hanging on the wall beside Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, with which people generally ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, that is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists living in poverty and died in poverty, refused to money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Buenos experts in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: Official of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can engage in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the kings were the correct all was another way, the kings may not understand very well the culture, but knew that it was necessary to keep the experts correct. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow there is now very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg that could well be experts, but are closed, because it needs experts to a higher level that correctly assessed to them and open way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now it is thriving the personal taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is it for you St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there are ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones is difficult for the art grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural ground and we are now more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is tiny. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We have to make the art is fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be implemented with a grant of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in the space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Tierra is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or an asteroid strike murderer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spacecraft with humans onboard leave in search of a planet parts. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To preserve humankind becomes the main question: How continue the species in weightlessness or on the same planet parts? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that there is little to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;these are Venus and Mars,&quot; said the chief investigator of the astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago that were carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit are not diferenciaban in none of the terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, was sent to the space quail eggs to see how the embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Get as a result a chick normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;the problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and start to move,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Unable to find support, the chicks were randomly Acer. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in newborns gave a total atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks not reacted to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And the misfortune was that after four days simply died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;and twice we were born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them,&quot;, says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time a &quot;biological&quot; miniarca flew to orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, in the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; only travel species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the area space with fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;this was precisely in the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out&quot;, he says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it has not yet managed to address the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an emotional fund. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel to space for 50 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk happened Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And most fundamental that has humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: If you are after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> May or not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;after all, this question no one has responded,&quot; says veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights all have found good, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;and if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights,&quot; summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, the hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must find some new avenues in biotechnology, in the radiological protection, in the creation of the artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hidrolaboratorio the Centre for the preparation of cosmonauts is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> In terms of buoyancy void, cosmonauts practise their skills to work in the space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water simulates the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, even hostile, for a newborn child is a native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small hombres-anfibio seem to confirm that life on Earth emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is located approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bathing spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;this is very little to forget something,&quot; says Marina Aksenova, monitor swimming babies. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the weightlessness is a state more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary and gravitation, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the weightlessness the abdominal muscles and pelvic decrepitan is very fast, the ability of expulsion of the fetus is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we drop, relying on the action of stimulants for the delivery. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it pulls aside. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot;, Valeri Polyakov is this original question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the sense of gravity, the agency does not generate the skeleton and muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> To a newborn in orbit is impossible to dress with a special suit for training, as adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Simply strip you of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;and this experiment that we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to traigamos to the Tierra to a disabled, to a person fully inadaptada&quot;, provides the head of the bioethics committee of the Instituto of biomedical problems of the Academia de Ciencias de Rusia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships travel to a distant planet that will be the home to their children born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the system &quot;švarc&quot; has not provided with the political guilty </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the area of public tenders, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, but its application falls short. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> So said Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Oficina Supreme Control Suprema (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;the law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct.&quot; this is, in my opinion, what we lack, &quot;so describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The joint controls of the inspectors Czechs and Germans also come to similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of a practice malpractice, says the attitude of Petr Nečas into the system of autonomous be only on the paper, which is known as the system &quot;švarc&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) government would not harass entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;the law must be regulated in some way and if ban something, in this case, neither the president of government cannot prevent the actions of the office that has the duty to perform such controls or demand obligations,&quot; said Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the commission of control in Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the team Czech and German, in the framework of which was likened the legislation to the public tenders in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What is it exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> This is a control non-self-healing we start to make around two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simplified way: European legislation regulates how they should organize the public tenders, this was still the legislation in each country and, later, the practice itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have joined all and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is &quot;more rigorous and more complete,&quot; however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can bring in fact this project? What do you think are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is a common control of this type could contribute to which we invest efforts in the implementation of laws, debt reduction and improving the limits, although this does not have a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of saving means to achieve an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not for the fact reduce the limit of awards mean that we are going to do it. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated with both &quot;red tape&quot;, that those who want to search for bugs in the system may do so more easily that if the limits would remain as high as it is now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You spoke of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of the public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of checks in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is organized differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Regarding the offices, as the NKÚ, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to our own, with a college also, the only thing is that in his case is somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also the powers are to some extent analógas, however, as Alemania has an organisation, federal courts of auditors are even at this level. In this differs slightly aspect of our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there is, in Alemania, in the Tribunal Federal of Cuentas. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to local legislation, is more simple than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Generally, I would like to draw a comparison without concrete evidence. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but you cannot specify exactly what is best. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> What could be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That sure that no, but, I repeat, I like to do this type of comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must confront a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If not, they would be no benefit to collaborate with our office, does not believe? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> With regard to the legislation of our country, what it meant to her Office the amendment of the law on public tenders are manifested in any way their incidence? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet manifested in the proceedings of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Given that we ex post controls, there need to be a certain delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For now, there is in the process of preparing for the future controls: We have launched a new tool to detect risk &quot;not cheap&quot;, for which we have done spend nearly 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as adjusted, corrected conditions for some types of the selection process and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope that it will. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the regulations &quot;harden&quot; and that it will be impossible to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already with the previous regulations, persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional council regional operational programmes), and every law not respected in the field of government awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does it make sense then tighten the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think not in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to attacking or respect. &lt; / p &gt; of him and not punish those who commit a malfunctioning formal, which has no implication in decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create a bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Y how do get out of this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We &apos;ll see where it takes us this path begun. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister has recently declared that the SDGs government would not harass entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact be autonomous only on paper. What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Does the system švarc &quot;is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be regulated in some way, and if prohibits something, then even the first minister of government can prevent the performance of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such checks and require obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say: &quot;we change the law and allow it to be,&quot; but cannot say that we as if nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public tenders, the regulations are very strict regarding the manner in which they must act formally. And that is as it should be to protect the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic that excluded the candidate with the best offer for failing to comply with the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are ice sheets, although most of them are passable </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several places in the Czech Republic roads are plates of ice and snow. </seg>

<seg id="1108"> It is only one among so many other alarmist news that we like agarrarnos. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> The music group The TAP TAP we like rather to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, in december organizáis a project really original: Three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you explain this to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity event that we have been planning for two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to exploit the potential of marketing that has the end of the Mayan calendar sentence for the December 21 at 11: 10 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The previous day, on December 20 to 21 hours, organizaremos three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Will end at roughly the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> It was initially my idea, then we develop the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to muster sufficient energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state of the world that we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of items: Boots, t-shirts, bags and original key fobs against the end of the world which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another form of support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The TAP TAP, together with other interpreters, also sang the anthem called against the end of the world, which goes by the title &quot;Fin of the world, canceled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the charity concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course we do, and shall be just the latest, well, whenever everything goes well and not the world... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The sing all the interpreters at the same time in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The hymns are second among themselves simultaneously thanks to the broadcast special live in the Czech TV. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, which also sings Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did this collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We work together even with other personalities of the cultural scene czech, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put all our efforts in participate in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been shown that the majority of them are interested and amused work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What is A ineended the money collected in concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association TAP in Jedličkův ústav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with the fun and interesting activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students do not have adequate means to pay for teachers and make a efuerzo to make this possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we trasladaremos with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In each concert act a number of groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the criteria for selection? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive for all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you have planned some other &quot;spectacular&quot; similar action in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May will for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here we surely an attractive package with guests interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also like to play in the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now, have done for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The TAP TAP is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is the logistics and organization of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so difficult how it can seem at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five members in electric of wheels, the wheelchair must travel in the baggage compartment and in addition also carry much weight, boxes with the tools... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far, however, we have fared well. ČSA and British Airways were well prepared, thing that never ceases to amaze me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, went without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad can compare the different attitudes of society towards the handicapped and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What ye have found so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there continues to be prevalent that a person is held alone in the city centre in an electric wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Something as common as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair lift, there is not. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, has created a civil association that strives to tematizar the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what areas we must take example of more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many ways in which we are going behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the people that are directly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is quite normal that people with severe disabilities moves through his mind in public and can go to the service, the museum, wherever... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, in this aspect, with The TAP TAP go a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the moment comes that arise eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Until now, they are isolated cases of people who have a large force of will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The TAP TAP is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what I led to form the group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where he had many young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician, playing, among others, the saxophone, an amateur group founded with a co-worker. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a little hands (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity did not until these last few years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us rather the fact connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that is, it is as if there were no. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can afford also teacher quality, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Do you have intention to go so far with The TAP TAP? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I saw the potential that had, that can be done something differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The entertainment world is full of things that seem to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, in its own way, everything new is viewed cautiously welcomes and takes a long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The TAP TAP is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who we ve for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not neglected ones who suffer and that we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that the necessary resources available. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if something comes to people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as he describes many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do a work of quality, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think it is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they hear that have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend much time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria les them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently the group The TAP TAP has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group open, people entering and exiting, cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has will and desire will always find doors open </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Will be the day before the expected end of the world, the 20.12.2012 Thursday at 9pm </seg>
<seg id="1191"> It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno Fléda and Plynojem in Ostrava and participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The three cities will be connected to the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the band The TAP TAP &quot;End of the world, canceled&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational center without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, costing 25 million korunas. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry to the option of advance sale in Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week was accepted Poland as twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of ESA of the old block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Polonia initiated an intense collaboration with the ESA in the year 1994 and during subsequent years participated in the commission of projects the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, the path of Poland to the cosmos began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The Polish enthusiasts, as were flights into space before the Second World War, although not always understood his work. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas about the pioneering study &quot;Introduction to the cosmonautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) were indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 Šternfeld scored in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for its &quot;Introduction to the cosmonautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), previously mentioned, became later in a big driver of astronomy and the cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Published hundreds of articles in magazines Polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a promoter of the cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the far side of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in the year 1925 was built in Polonia a dresina going to be loaded with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and did not know details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the start of the dresina or for its braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In the year 1933, the Polish artillery began to engage missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stadium of the evidence practices. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, with the arrival of German troops, was halted the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a missile photoelectric game designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza,&quot; the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were intended for military use of engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, the Committee interim scientific adviser (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) is responsible for all projects of techniques of missiles for military use and coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In the November issue of 1954 the magazine Problemy referred for the first time to society with four articles very extensive dedicated to the astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society devoted to the cosmonautics. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of astronautics (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> Played this office until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket that carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time the 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a heyday of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not to the 5 kg of weight. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, was finished version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 the aerial evidence of the rockets RM-2 two stages in the wilderness of Błędów. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket 1.4 metres measured and weighed about 11.5 kg </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of developing rocket was going to be the object of scientific study. The rocket RM-34 going to have a swing of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, in 1962, suspended the work. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> It was designed as rocket of two phases, with a total length of 510 cm and a weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> There are three types (so-called developed Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which is diferenciaban between yes by the space available for scientific apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> In the rocket Meteor-1A the available space for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Institute Aérien the rocket Meteor-2, whose first tests airlines began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km in height. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently the version was built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is necessary to mention also the entry of Polonia in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and training of the national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation of cosmic space on artificial satellites Soviets and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court suspended the law traabajos. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Since then it will be interesting to examine the problems existing since a more comprehensive view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal economic systems in the UE, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less ausschusses,. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Accordingly, this means that the different ways economic and national economic systems are in conflict standing among themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause is in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of the big differences in the labour cost (wages) produces economic stress. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer with cheap goods imported, try to shorten distances and that &quot;causes a bajadda&quot; in the price of competitor with the aim of taking the bulk of the market, and thus increase their profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale means, for the majority of entrepreneurs, move production abroad, buy it cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries in which the price of labour, in comparison with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital has no social responsibility whatsoever and, with it, nor is it responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon produces, grows necessarily social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> All this leads to the complete lack of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for economic and social damage caused in its pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to make specific statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Unscrupulous practices of private equity create situations, in particular economies, in which governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of the population itself, and thus attract foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Put another way, governments put private capital at the disposal of its own population without taking into account social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is especially evident in changes in applicable laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The objective is forcing the population to accept the diktat of private capital, especially as regards wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of financial liability in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the right of employees to work. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty together with the widening gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a number of years, exist in Germany points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot keep up with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people who receive this type of aid arrives at million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a case quite common: People employed with a wage so low that the state should pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It became a public scandal of this kind related to the situation of the employees of the German federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The savings of almost all the southern states of the EU lead, no doubt, to the same situation. People, under pressure from a precipitous decline of its social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or malvivir with a salary foul on the edge of society, with the hope that one day arrives to the country private investor capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is it necessary to preguntrarse where does it come from? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians and Africans still work by a tiny part of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also affects all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and the media claim to the mantra that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to lead the economy leads to failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private equity defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Below, it is necessary to ask whether private equity has no influence with their selfishness in the political march, and thus throughout the state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case, the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and pervasive in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation that manifested in the field of corruption, in the mutual favors, in a legislation that is reprehensible almost everywhere but it is not punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is the following: Government ministries, lack of financial means, responsible for drafting laws to private law firms, which are often linked with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> This type of bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are rapidly in a situation that describes how the Appiános in his book The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompei: &quot;the state had been disintegrating and administrations are occupied by force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In exchange for bribes, favours obtained illicitly and help to finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and the people went to the polls to vote apalabrado in advance &quot;...&quot; there were people with character who wanted to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disarray, the state was eight months without consuls &quot;...&quot; began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man &quot;... Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, César rose to power and transformed democracy to autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, just as in antiquity, is that the current society is based in desconsideradas preferences of individual profit without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not capable, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same as then, a decline of unprecedented elite, without make an effort to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the rampant liberalisation of the economic systems in the nineteenth XIX and XX. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, it is possible to see the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy of sorts, as a pause, waiting for the next coup. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact really devastating is that the elite current ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian of the disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know it in the ancient history and the most recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public tenders is not the solution; at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to keep looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is concrete socio-political reforms, to reinforce both the involvement of the state capital as the influence of citizens in the government and that weakens the position of monopoly of private equity in society for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: The laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;that nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot; (No labelling, nothing of violence and nothing could do so), Sting in the song Fragile and whose refrain puts &quot;Let &apos;s do not forget how fragile we are&quot; (no we let go of how fragile we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;if my children would not want wars, there would be no&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in the year 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One of the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and get boxed Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and accused Israel of terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to focus on who is guilty of killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today &apos;s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my considerations were based on historical facts, other conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of humankind the history of the struggles for power is in the front row. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what is no longer so clear is whether these the characters were which directing his footsteps of own or if behind his throne had someone who guided their actions towards a particular goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of power and money that this implies, could not be reached in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among these families astronomically rich highlights one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but did not exclude): The Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> It is not write much about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the years 90 of the 19th century bought the first (Reuters news agency) to stop associating its name with criminal acts of great seriousness. The power and wealth, or both, covering the shoulders, thing for them always meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have significant holdings in almost all central banks of the world and in those countries that are not represented, has been declared or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after overthrowing Qaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the rule of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc McFadden was poisoned 1936 after want to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Its quest for global power led them over the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchical states across Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (such number of slaves to their well-being and luxury enough and not consume many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which operates the group of the richest households, together with the Rothschild, remains the dynamics of the unfolding crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order ab Dai - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions, however, are wrong, and always entail a worsening of the situation. If not, it is sufficient to recall that the Fed was created in order not to repeat of a crisis of 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the onset of the First World War, destroyed Czarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended in a sudden and unwarranted from a military point of view, and economic capitulation of Germany (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were unnecessary because) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To prepare the ground of the Second World War, allowed bankers and politicians create, covertly, a troubled situation in the wake of the massive war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby created the conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, the mere act to the Germans the solution to the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and drew guilty, and build after a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority who should represent as well, and was the role of the fifth column, that lit the flame and caused the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the nineteenth century the Rothschild fueled the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch which aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour declaration referred to above laid the foundations for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Are produced terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The outbreak of the Second World War: It is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the rope to which they were bound international bankers in a principle or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jewry in concentration camps created the conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in global society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948, and similarly to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was established the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers would initiate, the Jewish nation, as well as in the Second World War, become a victim in front line of the battle, now with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. Take, for example, how to divide so adamant supporters and detractors of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who are doing everything they can to declare war on Iran, and considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to become a global conflict, and if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of the entire global oil (the corridor of navigation has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy. </seg>

<seg id="1335"> Film Argo: If it is crude, call to Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a group of the manifestation of Islamist students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> His release was going to be a change in the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the US administration the situation offered no positive perspective: Throw the Shah overboard they could afford, because, if they did, jeopardizing the trust of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not available. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Diplomats detained were released 444 days after the intervention of negotiation of the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The failure in Iran Irán contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections of. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film &quot;Argo&quot; director and actor Ben Affleck puts an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the embassy, escaped six employees of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a complicated journey, ended in the residence of the Canadian embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, got out of Iran, so that helped a story covert an extravagant point: Came with Canadian passports, as members of the team that reviewed film location in the country for the filming of an overproduction of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan that outlined the expert in &quot;exfiltración&quot; Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> For the fabrication seems truthful, wrote on the film project in periodicals, press conferences were organised, the production company fictitious was even a real release. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details about the operation remained secret for a long time, the film has been made on the basis of the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film Affleck is a unique combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a political thriller realistic; on the other, a &quot;caper movie,&quot; the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example might be the series Ocean &quot;s Eleven). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film combine the states of mind. We find a well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are photographs emblematic of the era of events, which were reflected in the same way in the film; there are many differences in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, scenes typical of Hollywood somewhat more energy-intensive, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And in addition, scenes of the CIA and other institutions: Men elections that analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been ridiculed, has become a respectable director and their way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> ARGO is his third largometraje, after &quot;Adiós small, Adiós&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town. City of thieves&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first movie of Affleck in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic which placed to the directors of old films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Shows and Affleck in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;wheel&quot; in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events truthful true. The introductory sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive by its capacity synoptic that, at the same time, trasmite the thrill of bemusement and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history is a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team imposter in the bazaar of Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that a history be does not offers much in the sense of the most intriguing cinematic scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And manages quite well. Sometimes adds something to reality: Here is all so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit after its runway become a craze). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the confusion that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a role very fact as cofinanziamento of Hollywood, although its characters held that is deserved more space and are not, nor much less, the unique in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these reasons, the film Affleck loses a little hint dramatic, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, assessing its performance and style pavilions of a thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But that will collapse, that will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As evocation of a real story and proof of that can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omnisciencia of the secret services, is sufficient. </seg>

<seg id="1384"> The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that bananas higher-quality should take into the UE a length of at least 14 cm and could not submit &quot;curvaturas abnormal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended himself, saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards not homogenized to date, only complicate their marketing. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the UE, despite the opposition of some states have their on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of edible. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the US of last year, according to which the inflatable balloons that are marketed it is obligatory to warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to puffing them up without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The US was referring here to an American study according to which, when you talk about toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is also a similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Strange occurrences are born even in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Equally absurd is the regulations regarding European officials: Anyone who has any formal role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. Not to hurt the sensibility of Greece, is due to speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of economists liberal laissez faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state. </seg>

<seg id="1394"> Later, the Czech Republic overturned, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which he made a threat of substantial fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey are also interested the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> This kind of ideas not emerged in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>

<seg id="1400"> According to shovels, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of grain of countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposed to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is intended to the writing of grant applications from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: Prescriptions are a rare exception </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how it happened to run for election for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If in our country was all right, then not present my candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But no longer can withstand see how robbing in the past twenty years in our country, how thieves are unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> He had no ambitions to be political. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something I like, attempt to find a solution to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I already have forty years, and my nomination is independent, the only possibility to have to change things is running as a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The Senado has already arrived, but shortly after has been put in path to the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it not giving back to those people who have voted him? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, precisé that if elected Senator, submitted my candidacy for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my goal is not the role; the role is the tool with which I realize my own ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need the greatest possible influence and the mandate stronger as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we are a nation that we still criticized in the bar or in front of the television, but that pisoteamos to anyone who wants to initiate a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> This is compounded by the media, which undermine and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For me it is said that I bribed to journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are going to talk about their ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It is presented to the presidential fight with thesis financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To this must change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As the president does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How want to solve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, &apos;ve formed part of a group of pressure for the officio guide were recognized as autonomous work, and it was. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is in politics: If someone comes with a good proposal, either right-wing or left-wing, is it on purpose and this affects citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all the parliamentary groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without encasillamientos or dogmas party, i have the ability to choose something power of each party that is best for our country and implemented. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider rather a man of the right or the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the point of view Czech, I have the impression that the people I considered more leftist. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it is not important, whether a little left or a little right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What matters is that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I do not care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or SDGs and, by the same token, I will be against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> A joke when you say to you that it is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it is not showing what it says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, have also certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And try to get to them. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> There will be those who call populism, but all the proposals of which I speak are already in the world or known experts speak of them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of parliament only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that cannot survive in the long-term policy. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe you that are going to people and talk with them, will, for example, a criminal and financial? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Convince politicians, journalists and civil society, and try to spell them on my part to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live telecast on television in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties that lend legitimacy to the criminal responsibility for financial and political, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, eventually, they would have to communicate why not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong character that said disputes, can be done pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Consider the direct election of the president, who has been a success of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I afirmo that I only just a amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my opinions and ideals attempt to seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I just start in politics and attempt to obtain the widest possible support for my agenda. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Attempt to take things forward myself, but if it goes well, within six years and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a bit like Okamura out to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that a person does not do anything, so I visited a number of well-known personalities, if it is encouraging to submit his candidacy for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because he had much work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part, at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which brought to light the fraud with light oils. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I stood on the basis that the people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the population went to the polls, and those who did, voted to the representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> However, I judge my own ideas, such as for example the direct election of mayors or governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Looking to form his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not yet seen because I do not have time for this, for the past record of each of potential members of the party, nor do I have money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind transparent there are only 20,000 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> &apos;t have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Talk statements of the property, how is it yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think my private property in some 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a ground valued at $25 million, a flat valued 10 million, another floor assessed in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin of about $3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at a million, and I have a couple of million. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have a Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I &apos;ve always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the iniquities and injustice. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> What drives an Aston Martin, its property is regarded in 60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You said that you want to change the republic but not want to put too much money on your part. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Do I have to endeudarme? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that has no sponsor demonstrates that there is much interest in my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign covered in essence what will I receive as salary of a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live it. For example, could not pay my son to school English, which costs 30,000 crowns per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only earn money, then I would stand as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So that will continue with its business to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Has said before that he was going to leave this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This has nothing to do with a salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, in part I left my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people want outside the Samaritan that saving the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How customary to win monthly as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I winning. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were president, then would leave the business. </seg>

<seg id="1506"> Nobody comes by taste in these libraries passé, why not? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory city located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having risen to a record to forget. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the lowest literacy rate of the Países Bajos. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counter this shameful situation, some years ago, it was decided to contribute in any way to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that are represented in the euro banknotes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive educational was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so it was as policymakers decided that there was a chance to improve statistics: To build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the study of Dutch architects MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar diagrams and fun buildings in the cynics, took the subject with its usual calmness and appeared to the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked bewildered around her and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and ended his brief speech with the words: &quot;dear fellow citizens: </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here you have it, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called &apos;Boekenberg&apos; &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros on rises in place. </seg>

<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project is also nominated for &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> In this way, the small town bereft of history, which until the date had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a city incredibly ugly after as white façade one intuiría rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now available the first public cultural building in its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese-making. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right at the heart of this massif, but real lovers of space and reading did not use it, but who prefer to commune with its topography every step of the climbing to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The interior completely glazed is bright and easy to cover with view, the soil mix of brick and the elegant streetlights unequivocally support the condition of the public library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The look is to arrive to visualize the banks of the park, dogs and children and girls playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And by all sides books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and in the centre opens a huge dark room, which usually tends to be somewhat awkward and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we have done is to put upside down the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area of the interior abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain is very well taken: In the middle are offices, the library the Internet, the chess club, the centre of environmental education and the board of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Special mention deserved the shelves to assume the functions of mural coating, balustrade parapet and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The sight, the touch and smell are strangers. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers more civilians a day shake their heads when they hear about this material unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;we wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And that is as one day, on a farm Friesland, we come to the right by-product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands Países Bajos a few millimetres thick plastic fabric is used as a basis to hold the roots of crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is a cheap and efficient material. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library this fabric is prensó, for the first time in such quantities, to achieve irons of four centimetres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With the heat and the pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and that smells like a mixture of new car and zapatilla of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps to the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 metres around the mountain awaits us the reward: From the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy tasty croquettes Dutch, and their planted fig in enormous pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create a pleasant atmosphere to the couple who maintain the atmospheric humidity appropriate for this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;believe it or not given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in regard to ecology,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The heating and cooling needed obtained from geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a massive pyramid of glass, even in the sunniest days in the sun shines only a few hours inside. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The cerchas huge timber located in regard to the façade facade glass serve to provide shade and absorb the majority of &apos;s rays of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a climate comfortable interior. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is thing of the automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the worker skeptical of the Information Technologies, already has dared to set foot in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Similarly, a professor of Chinese traditional medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes as the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; as &quot;the late soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration took place a couple of weeks ago, invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This way it aims to fill the gaps optical a library which does not yet have its complete archive; currently has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has seeped deep. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;there is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that, thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have some link with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book form part of the library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although only is there to decorate. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In this way, the study MVRDV has been a success in that discipline queen who specializes in the argot is known as &quot;creation of an identity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Regardless of how young and uneducated that may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally a starting point for shaping their identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans should play a greater role in&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert kapur U.S. EE. UU.-Europa, this puts Berlín in a diplomatic position quite tricky peliaguda. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to give the Palestinians territories the status of Estado observer of the Naciones Unidas. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why?? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I believe that it supports the US position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establish a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This has been declared finally by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Do you find it difficult to Germany to take a clear position when they are at stake international issues important? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because in the moment is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the Estados Unidos and focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what further complicates things is that Europeans do not have a policy consistent and uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that are still test what its role, but have already begun the path to a foreign policy &quot;normal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to the countries such as France or Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What it means specifically a foreign policy &quot;normal&quot; from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend different positions in the United States and its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e., in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The bürgschaftsgebühr economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Alemania should protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Are these economic interests have influenced the position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has big markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this reason must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion, nor of Arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I will not give so much importance because it is not a completely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> However, play a key role in the German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain in the vote on important decisions as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys a huge degree of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a break as dramatically as in the case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, all this has not done but demonstrate that it is a country that taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In contrast, the UU. has been shown clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there disparity of views between the U.S. and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been these disparities due to the US domestic policy. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration shows in secret a great understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation unfolding here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public that position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real disparity of views is not in fact the scale that is attributed to him. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look relations between Obama and the Primer Ministro israeli Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for nothing excited with the policy that develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Do you find it difficult to Germany to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, to the position of its main partners in the EU, for another? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Believe that that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the bürgschaftsgebühr. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a European policy coherent and homogenous, but that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, do not have the opportunity to be part of an upper body, but must drive things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role to compel Europe to adopt a European approach. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether simply for the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a theme peliagudo. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think that the Germans have clear that must play the role of independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Do you see Germany itself in the role of significant international actor? Do you want to actually Germany take a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or perhaps still finds it difficult to accept that leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet accustomed, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a leading actor, it triggers certain sentiments flat hierarchies. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is an old problem is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the countries countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen in this way, Germany is in a position much more difficult than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must show an attitude receptive to the various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the U.S. in European politics decreases increasingly, but the EU does not cover of time that vacuum, who is then? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans they have no choice but to assume a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like, if it is unpleasant or if it becomes a people even more unpopular, c &apos;&apos; est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the executive director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analyzed together the challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, which has specializes in German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;protection of trademarks in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a brand known globally and Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But, what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> After this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it enjoys protection while the real epónimos not submit a demand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then it is not clear that they go to give the reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the firm Taylor Wessing specialized in protection rights violations in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week comes to my table a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada Prada-Kny is recorded. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies also copied legally in the same way, as happened to the sporting goods maker Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens an archive which holds seats of the trademark office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010 a Chinese company sought to register the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that is also served to the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That chinese are world champions in this copying and of violating intellectual property rights is widely known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities there are large stores of several floors devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeit. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, cases of Pattloch are of a different nature. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademark office formally give Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese what is called &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or brand companion. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word has its origin in the Chinese term &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> That makes reference to women who have &quot;fish&quot; a rich man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;it is detrimental to the business, we have to fight this,&quot; requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;the brand is waters, the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned are millonarias, especially in the case of products emblemáticos of luxury. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year China is, in size, the third-largest market for luxury goods and the growing faster. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and involves a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The processes can extend up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name of the demand had already become a &quot;market reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &quot;if the applicant had bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China,&quot; says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a litigation against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by the German concrete pumps manufacturer Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why today the Chinese can continue using an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer for Volvo, blurred, used the principle a blue and white logo that he remembered largely to BMW; the issue is dirimió in the courts and blurred had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of clothing company Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo was a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledged that in 2010 have had difficulties due to shortages of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, &quot;the labour emergency situation returned to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this way, the number of processes of claim without process has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57,000 of these cases were settled resolved, a 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81.500 claims are still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Fight against this costs a lot of money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is often customary in China, the figures are startling. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It would be a new record and means that China leads for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the trademark office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this also applies to the number of logos valid, a figure that rises to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, would be embolsado 1.8 billion yuan in concept of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Put another way, this means that on average each entry costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Combat this costs a lot of money, as shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group tussle in the courts against a imitador Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of automotive component of imitation, </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The copycat has managed to ensure the Chinese rights on the trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;we ourselves have caused this situation because in Alemania the surname are not protected,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, Presidente and Consejero Delegado of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Múnich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the Münchners. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the two following instances have given the right to Freudenberg, but the other side continues fighting today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> There is take extreme care </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, where remains outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hoped to resolve the issue and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, it also states that &quot;the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the file has had to review records of up to one hundred years old to be able to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered to the other side a &quot;six-figure sum in Euros&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but was not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;this shows how much we care,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers that lurk in the Far East threaten to affect Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Specifically, if the imitators ensure there rights in trademarks are not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather factories. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Long ago that the group left the area of trade, however managed to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;we have to be very carefully,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend to the German companies that are extremely cautious about doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international law concerning the rights of mark, but what there is to do is &quot;record also in China anything that can be susceptible of protection&quot;, as are Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the issue may be much more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, in the case of Freudenberg lost the latest round of their battle particular, would then have to pay the licence fees for its own behalf, such as Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> This or in the segment in question we expulsarían of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Global day of the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg tested the chorus Imbongi and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a link able to overcome a lot more of 8.733 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First starts for the dance: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and mocasines looking for the compass on the parquet, and found quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (alto, bass, tenor and soprano), arremolinándose, entorpeciéndose and dedcated each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatens to get away of their boxes to try to make order with its energetic gestures and mild. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi tested a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> They have also reached the 50 singers, between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the master of the house. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om &apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, every voice to the chorus has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: The Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some areas. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> For the self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations agenda for the fight against AIDS, around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents to 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover the school fees, uniform and will guarantee a hot meal per day in the Gogo Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi in Zulu means &quot;narrator of stories&quot; or &quot;panegirista.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this room, nobody knows speak fluently this Bantu language, but sing themselves know. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Since ten years ago this chorus rehearsal songs on this smooth foreign language which sometimes achieves jumping to their place of origin: Southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> To 8.733 miles away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices in this chorus German. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The forty percent is infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the SIDA. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: The infection rate of AIDS highest and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population not well-wisher circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland are carriers of immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered this hidden population, but what they saw on all were many children in the streets that lacked not only the protection of their fathers, but the main thing: Food, clothes and training. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without a title school, the chances in a poor country are more rare. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few making it possible for a child to school and to enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> However, a year after the chorus founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; since then has been professionally of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts on sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What Cuáles are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the ETS of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> STDs of origin are commonly used AIDS virus, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The crab louse and scabies are among the ETS transmitted by parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups of affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute, part of the basis that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are more common infections by Chlamydia, tricomonas, the human papilloma virus, candidiasis (thrush) and gonorrhea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The contagion of HIV among the heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of all new HIV infections occur in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people, infections by clamidia are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to surveys communities, three quarters of all the infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the human papilloma virus also adds to the diseases more common among the young. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has evolved the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 to $3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections maintains a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, trouble urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore not detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but not offer protection to one hundred per percent. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infected with dirt and by physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this reason, experts recommend submit regular medical examinations, especially if it changes with frequency of sex partner. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> If they are diagnosed early, the majority of STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any consequence late. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the chorus for their performances throughout Germany, managed to raise enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;in total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the people Zodwa Dlamini a woman confident and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It took that orphans are a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> &quot;gogos,&quot; as it is called to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans from, dependants, offer them a roof where they live and take care of children going to school every day on time and in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who have nobody left under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, earns a salary of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has launched a sewing school, has built two coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the town &apos;s residents have been subjected to an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not something obvious, since, despite the clear that is this disease throughout the entire country, are is usually not talk openly of it. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is a taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Something strange in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The Black last absolute monarch of África Negra, the King Mswati III, is known for its opulent lifestyle and chockfull of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy, instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This way of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has seen the HIV virus in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But it is also due to the countless temporary workers around the country from one side to another and to take wherever they go. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> It is another culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To promote the cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white people who sing songs in a language of black; both recognition not only entails a great environment and a lot of joy, but that also has made arrancarle a couple of tears to some that another soldier rabid rabioso. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey takes them always to Esitjeni, where the singers visit sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Despite that this small population barely appears in the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well-known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;after to Esitjeni, there shines the light,&quot; says local people. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after touring the 8.733 miles as the crow flies back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine his light from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA finds ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the layer of ice has a thickness of up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also ice water, as may be seen in three studies published Thursday in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has been formed a layer of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that it is at least 30 centimeters and probably even until 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is presumably of comets or, with great likelihood of asteroids that collided against Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help clarify how have reached the water and other components of life to other areas of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix are dedicated to explore the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Once in a while send images to Earth: Small windows to the immensity of space. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no &quot;planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This section of an image taken by the infrared Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; in which appear endless generations of stars: The oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although it more difficult to recognize is the pink color of the stars &quot;newly born.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region of formation of stars, called a bit romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> This image tornasolada of a star in extinction was taken by the Spitzer telescope of NASA. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The ring in the form of careless is composed of the material that the star escupe in the process of extinction. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the enormous cast Trífida, to 5.4 years light of the Tierra, form new stars from gas and dust. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope of NASA took this photo of the area of galactic star formation. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pléyades, a group of stars also known by the nickname &quot;The Seven Sisters,&quot; are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, with the telescope can better appreciate the colors. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The fog of the propeller appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> Is located at 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarity to land a continent has earned him the nickname of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image leads to a spectacular colour. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This star in the making could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope &apos;s infrared detectors. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: How originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> It is probably remains of one of the moons of Saturn who disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the largest and most sharp pictures taken by the Hubble telescope: The Galaxy of the whirlpool. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the drink, some images of galaxias galaxies become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula Trífida located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The Trífida name comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three), as dark lines of dust burning divide the heart of this area of stellar formation in three lobes. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the evidence of a cosmic snooker: 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging hurtled down the one to the other to end up irreparably. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Those who do not like of abbreviations techniques may refer to it with the nickname of Southern chewed. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the cast Iris in the constellation of Cefeo. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The cast is located at 1400 years light is composed of particles of dust whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was created from images optical and X-ray telescopes made by different. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists known as the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this fog is the group of brightest young stars of our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> This area of stellar formation constantly produces new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta, also constantly arise new star; to 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy as shining with a small black hole is still no dust, only gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The researchers assume that was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our window on the universe: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei one year after the stigma to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescope has not stopped growing and images that we offer are increasingly depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, EE. USA., get out the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The interior of the Great Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite this, reaches a diameter of about 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The drawback of this building is more economical that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so his mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Tejas also has a fixed angle lifting. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite having a diameter mirror comparatively smaller, such capacity is comparable to the mirror telescopes largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of the existing radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the &quot;Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) can help anyone with a computer, providing processing capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that live up to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The ESO will also be hosting the so-called European extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT or European telescope extremely Grande). </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Until 2018 is not expected to be able to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna of KEA were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> These are equipped with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the Observatory Mauna KEA, which together with them explore the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> In Mauna KEA is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter mirror of thirty metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This is an image of how it would be. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since the 24 april 1990 sends images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> February 2, 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of his mission had been located 1.235 candidates for planets. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the image are recent run-up to the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the functions of the telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The researchers assume that in the south pole of Mercury there is also ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no compelling evidence, since the Messenger probe circling the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades the radar measurements point to the existence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, now scientists have the certainty that is so. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink butter daily and live 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> To the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> A search of footprints in a country where the people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> To the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> A search of footprints in a country where the people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The bus is moving forward with great commotion through the winding road that goes by wooded hills, rivers and the simple houses of local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> However, we are in the most southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is located just a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here are the &quot;talyshi&quot;, a town that not much is known, apart from dominating the Persian and the Azeri and they are very durable. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Our final destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too thick designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit it in a mountainous landscape so picturesque. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists barely reach this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, it is too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> For touring the 323 kilometers between both cities, it takes eight hours because the road is only one direction. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The staggering wealth of the country enjoys thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku became famous in May to celebrate the Eurovision Song Contest and the next year we celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This is the director of the Museum of longevity, perhaps the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is documented the lives of eight dozens of talyshis of the place that have exceeded 100 years old. Fatulayeva said an image in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, who lived through 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> A child died at the age of 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no birth certificate that certifies. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And if we take into account that the older man lived documented 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;he was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to conceive a daughter more at the age of 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has it wrong then Şirali Müslümov in their age in a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan are also very old people,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;even in Sardinia there are many older men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age; especially when there is no civil registration. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day glassfuls of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region situated around Lerik often reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Today there are 20 persons who exceed 100 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why live here, in the south, many elderly people? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the genes of the talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems logical that precisely the diet rich in calories of the talyshi who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom moreover, drink a glass melted butter, so healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Its 97 years is relatively young for what is customary for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Sitting on the ground, move tirelessly a huge tub of butter. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also cavort from one side to the other two small children. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen preparing tea for guests, a tea served in a typical vessels with a curved. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the scarf hiding two long braids of hair a dark blond that his son discovers us proud. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always wash your hair with milk, so I never has fallen and has maintained its color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;nor have I ever used a shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Always has eaten only what was in their own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> In all my life I have not been ever to make the purchase a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then we talk of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst was the time after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> However, all returned to his vehicle when the &quot;beloved father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, in Azerbaiyán the cult that is professes to the reassuring the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no limits. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He remained in power until 2003, when he handed the baton to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At least older people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva takes 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) in concept of monthly pension, an amount that you can live well considering the situation here. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the canoso son of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;in our culture the highest are well respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Living in a big family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> As if this were not sufficient reason to stay alive many years... </seg>
<seg id="1938"> In the Constitution lack the expression &quot;Human Rights&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Competing demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division that has gripped the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution, with sharia as the basis, it is very controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president spared in pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> &quot;we must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And that happen is my responsibility to the people and before God, &quot;said on public television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, Muslims and the secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> All of them, living without a remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> As explained Mohammed Mursi, almost sector, oops, has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Tribunal Constitucional and extend theirs &quot;in order to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, neither Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this engineer of 61 years with a PhD from the University of Southern California wants to save really. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Does it deprive of its power to the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles, whose adoption has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in an evening meeting of 15 hours, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, in the draft also says that the jurisprudence is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> However, what does it mean &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that islamists Islamists to seize this vague formulation, as well as the margin of manoeuvre associated with it legal, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least that is what suggests a new article added: In all matters of the Shariah is obligatory to consult the University Al-Ashar, the country &apos;s most important Islamic institution with a great power in the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would controlaría legislation, which in - effect - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> What is also problematic is that seeks to maintain the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As established the draft, the state has to protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote their morals and values.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2003"> Is it possible that the success of the country kept some relation to their appetite for a very smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a series of cheese excessively cured. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Colóquelos in the midst of a slew of soccer dirty clothes and wet. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave it there a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> May then oler the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the exquisiteces of Noruega. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Is nevado. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, fleet in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk is salted trout that is fermented in water, depending on what stinks you prefer, up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As it becomes dark and is becoming more cold, the Norwegians come in droves to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;shall come crude and then watering a glass of aquavit of a trago&quot;, says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the &quot;General of Rakfisk&quot;, which is 5000000, organise the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Everywhere we see people eating this fish is saved into small cubes and sipping from a drink large quantities of the drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;some people like the aquavit that the rakfisk,&quot; says 3.00. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Pruebo some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid pass near the nose, is not wrong; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has travelled a few kilometres by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty ravaged Norway and that, prior to the existence of cooling, the fish were kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt into airtight barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in winter, when it is fermented, removed, and obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, eats. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> A mere generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Currently, the population is rising rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and is not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite smelly, of the past. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is among the most expensive dishes that can buy. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a sandwich will cost a whopping £10 ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway often does not appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegians like that. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist that acribilló shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, refer to the shooting as &quot;the event of 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The norwegians cost it hard to believe that in its quiet country one of their own was capable of such cruelty and murder. </seg>

<seg id="2031"> &quot;but oil is not the only reason that we going so well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, while moving trays of rakfisk and that, with his long blond and its striking blue eyes, he represents the image of the Norwegian well-being. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;we are, as ye, people prudent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, as the majority of people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> &quot;we do not like to boast, we don &apos;t like the fanfare. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; all, except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, investing in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> While everyone was dissipating money that he did not during the years preceding the financial crisis across the world, Norway kept his wallet closed well. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;while we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;and eat rakfisk,&quot; she adds with a laugh developed. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow queuing to eat something; I already have had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Now a an elk burger is certainly something different and succulent suculento to enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But by the evening, that stinks fish. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I stay is one of the many venues which held a dinner of rakfisk in which the people voted the best fish, or perhaps the most tested the nostrils. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> A television has connected directly with a presenter leading a bow-tie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It seems the Eurovision contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;what are your scores for the best fish there up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;here is our score, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There is laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls out of the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps are the vapours of all that fish. </seg>

<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of its population. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city that, in the best of circumstances, it is already congested, has been installed since Monday a steel fence that cut several major roads leading to the city and it is causing enormous chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, however, was not prevent the workers could arrive at their place of work, but avoid the protesters could reach the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Faces a complicated task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the rule of outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country was plunged into a war against the narcotráfco that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;my government has a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; explained Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> &quot;let me propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the US, the prior political experience of Mr. Peña was as governor of his home state, Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A populous state and a rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Las opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A man sincere </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he recalls with affection. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Its residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in place and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city can be lead by one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, a huge improvement compared with the photographer roads and full of potholes that were refurbished. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> You can also see plates with his name on the entry of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum about climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;we are confident that he will make a real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> &quot;particularly in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Also rejects the status that the opposition makes lack of essence of the new president. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> &quot;he is a man very sincere, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a fantastic man of state and, above all, is a person who knows listen. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people on his former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled adoquinadas of Valle del Bravo could not be higher. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under sections of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems of the borough are also tough and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs that operate in the neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a desert plot, situated next to a garbage landfill, have been left abandoned in just the past two years, the bodies of dozens of women murdered. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of México while the Sr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than Ciudad Juárez, sadly known for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, in the best of cases, which failed to address the problem of femicide while he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía have to make efforts to contain tears as he shows photographs of their deceased daughter, Mary Moon. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana, committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believes that his partner the murdered. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;when I arrived at his house, it seemed as if he had been cleared the body,&quot; recalls Mrs Buendía. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> &quot;there were signs that had been beaten and rigor mortis had already occurred&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mary notes from the walls, alongside a cross that read a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family said that he has been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;the state authorities have treated as if it were an old chismosa, a prophet, a quejica. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that street &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;but this cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and negligence,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has pledged to give priority during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope it &apos;s the same kind of president who was when I was governor,&quot; said Congressman of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza more fear. </seg>

<seg id="2114"> The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment they received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council mandated to examine the intentions of suicide who had expressed in a form months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the regime of &quot;prevention of injury&quot; under which he was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that it had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is a degree below the watch for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted the rule more knew that I was well and (wanted) to be under prevention of injury... to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,&quot; said Manning. </seg>

<seg id="2143"> He says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to criticize those who were; he says that remind Mexicans in those difficult times </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that the mexicano-estadounidenses are caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had fallen by the esplanade and reached the area of immigration and was already totally confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Some posters suggested the path toward two tails: One for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; and another for &quot;Extranjeros&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was there for a few seconds without be sure where it should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Having grown up in Central California, during all my life I have called &quot;Mexican&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is shorthand ethnic, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York call themselves &quot;Italians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I decided on &quot;US-Mexico.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not needed. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> It was simply. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish. Well enough to para during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and I &apos;t get rid of my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and I put in the queue of foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time this week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> In the agenda of the day, as provided that they meet leaders of these two countries, contained: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Peña Nieto was willing to talk also of the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is just as likely that a Mexican left in Mexico as they venture to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> You want to associate with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, but gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> In Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of rancour. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably most of Americans will never accept that in 1848 the Estados States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of its territory at the barrel of a gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, that they think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that will remember him are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, at the time a United States official said anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press as among the elite Mexican, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the sons of Moctezuma are put on a war footing. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that have with the more than 35 million mexicano-estadounidenses living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> How We speak of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is much. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there were a person, it may be that the father or the mother or one of the grandparents, to which he closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to move towards the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the times that person encajaba in a given profile: Dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor people, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Mexico not. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, despite that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we cannot never lose sight of what we are witnessing is that the American dream, and not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty it is. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Is for the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many of the mexican belonging to the elite of the ruling class no les gustamos. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with México will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not been gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now we we would see trapped after this silk curtain, living well in the Estados Unidos but, even so, as solitary souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when he was a child, I remember that there is this contact between Mexicans and mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more strength who they are and the second this resent. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses I know feel that they are not part of either of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico they see us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States are considered Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as &quot;ambassadors&quot; makeshift of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We would say to our fellow Americans whimsical who is visiting that country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen its ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with inequality of wages, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid that you will be alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive to the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some mexicano-estadounidenses are still bitter about how they tried to their relatives makes a lot less time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps be more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamás could well be a unlikely basis to peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can some day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual useless and discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, despite the Israelis and Palestinians appear to be stuck in your old conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has ceased in shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this makes their struggle even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal deadly impasse could desencallarse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither loses nor is </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the optimism currently looks very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if it keeps the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say have forced Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite have killed some of their leaders and forced to pressure the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most wretched corners and villages of the planet, Israel has failed to break Hamás. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by their ruthless rival Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, the leaders of Hamas could come to the conclusion that time is working in their favor. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence across the Arab world, Hamas has made friends rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. It has made Qatar, one of the richest states and dynamic Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The exultant Hamas members say that the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, which dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its demise in 2011, it took too long to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders depend more on popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas emerges as the protagonist cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hardliner wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> With regard to the military issue, have put Hamas on its site. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Iron Dome anti-missile system of Israel has proven its effectiveness and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis stormy quiet... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has been widely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main chunk of a territory contender to become state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite that, according to international law, is illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even fiercer led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why pamper these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you really governed in the West Bank, would not rockets as they have done their compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have them behind that wall and give a good blow up if the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliner wing, although the Arab Spring might upset its calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although Islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere not have much appreciation to Israel, his priority will be to address the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defense budget of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the superpower of the area hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augers well and could mark the start of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also the Israelis should think in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination entails creating a powder keg that one day it will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded on a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography makes the situation worse as it increases the Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a toll diplomat growing. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a boost of outsiders. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution remains the touting sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire be a little more momentum to outsiders who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which should start to stem the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs outside the matter should also push Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has an important role in regard to achieve bring Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term failed to present its own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back in the White House, seems equally reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The law of generic packaging of tobacco comes into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packs of a dull green colour, which are the same for all brands of tobacco </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, enters into force and replacing the logos and colours of marks by a wrapper of a subdued green olive, a dreadful images of body parts with diseases and depictions of children and babies sick by be children of parents smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, obligatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in small font. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the strict regime the world applied to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia stated that the objective is to deter young people from smoking through the elimination of the traits that make this habit has glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Relying on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the 26 years, there is a 99% chance that never made. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;you can see that children, even from a very early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,&quot; said the Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls got the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Despite that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect too much the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar action. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has exercised enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argued that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, in which the cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;the legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Will increase the amount of tobacco counterfeiters will bring China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others say that your business has benefited after the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that demand for asparagus and covered with silicone to cover up the unpleasant images of the packs had shot up almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain &apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was waiting for more stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> &quot;for us it is a good business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the population sector than to the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and which oblige the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of tobacco has happened to be online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local websites, but cannot restrict foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;if comercializas tobacco and so you only is this small window to promote your products, the online space is the place more convincing in be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted an increase of review on marks from &quot;ordinary citizens&quot; published in social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether this is just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on implying the new rules where the season-long. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has even gone to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is restricting trade unfairly, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is likely that the WTO issued a resolution by the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering similar laws in the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce mandatory to include images in the packs. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> There are compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering tougher laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> In Australia, many smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> &quot;the photographs I do not affect. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply not the case. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;you take the cigar and keep the package,&quot; said Victor El Hage while buy a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> &quot;frankly, there is only one reason why stop smoking: For my daughter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, chief executive officer of King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, indicates that the packet uniform make it more complicated bring them into the bins. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;normally it took an hour in desenvalar a delivery; now it takes me four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;the government should be totally prohibited tobacco and then, is already, okay, ran out and closed the shop,&quot; says as lifts the hands upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad bored a little </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the thanksgiving of this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Loss-making a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite aburrido, even if you have means to be amusing, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But there is growing academics and experts in child development that praise the virtues of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is right that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Bored forces the brain to seek interesting options and it may be that encourages creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Given that, today, most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experienced the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So, should we accept in good spirits boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes it. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, as we will discuss this later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First, like many people, it assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, the boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as he says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of &quot;Boredom: A lively History&quot; (&quot; The boredom, a lively history &quot;) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;in fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> In the walls of Pompeii exist in Latin graffiti on the boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Also we have to ask how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &quot;the problem is that has already been defined and discussed in various ways,&quot; says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After reviewing the research published and raise the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of &quot;want, but not be able to participate in an activity that fills.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Affirms that the difference between the boredom and apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Notes that with apathy there is no desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The experience of boredom, he says, is &quot;alteration of the process of care, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom may sound terribly similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are boring, when what we actually happens is that we have trouble concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were sent to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person who read the article in a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups heard in the chamber adjacent a programme of television to a volume that was no connection, others heard with the volume low, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not heard the audio at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group that heard the program with the volume low showed more boredom than the other two groups; they took focus, but were not sure why and what attributed to the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &quot;when you try to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, alteration of the attention can lead to boredom,&quot; said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &quot;on the other hand, when you &apos;re doing something boring, such as detecting defective part in a line of manufacture, a music that distract you can help you will not get bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &quot;in fact, we know that move or make garabatos, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as do that person is physically more alert&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what is bored at some point: The delay of an airplane, one speaker monotonous, a film especially tiresome. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more inclined to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a &quot;scale of boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes issues like &quot;many of the things that I do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I don &apos;t have time to do everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more diverse. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that is bored quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in touch with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32 percent of adolescents said that it was bored in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said that was bored when he was not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said that it is boring. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that what he knew was that &quot;adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest point&quot;, in large part because to both children and adolescents are not given a great control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, to return to my question of principle: It is good to be bored? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, since, pushed the extreme, can make us expongamos to absurd physical risks, make bets or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as investigations show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;boredom is the way that the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is more appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you &quot;re bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cooking, that you will satisfy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you see the TV, it is possible that you meet in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &quot;so, if your child is bored and you give an iPad, it is possible that no longer get bored, but has not learned to entertain itself or dosificarse,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And that capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your son not only learn to entertain alone, but learn to be better controlled in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that really want to praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But nor should we be too critical towards him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of the constant hum of activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> The professor Eastwood is. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;in our view, we need aburrirnos more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing as to relate it to something worth,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Notes that what people really looking for is a way to unwind and enjoy a died time. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;in an environment where we are constantly sobreestimulados&quot;, says, &quot;is difficult to find ways to focus our attention where the noise ceases&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: Without instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college football and in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: The possession of stones of marijuana and a pipe used to fumarla. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco says that a day of september, he and some friends pushed by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when it stopped the police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The police found marijuana in the car and after a while Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in the reporting of the trial date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;they treat us like criminals,&quot; said Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> What are they? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of cases minors for possession of drugs depends less on the law of the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are canceling both here and in the state of Washington, where he passed a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police departments have ceased to bring charges against those aged 21 years for possession small-scale, which shall be legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors from more conservative districts in Colorado have pledged to proceed with cases opened for possession of marijuana, and are still quoting people. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western mountains, are voting to prevent open shops of marijuana, recently authorized, in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;all this is changing so rapidly that I do not know what will be next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who are responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington are also going to matter. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> Continue to seek advice and to establish a licensing system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this before the deadline on 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado goes ahead of most states in regard to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Commission of alcohol control of the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr. Smith admits that any part or system can only make suggestions about what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;there is no real precedent that we can serve as a model,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which nadará between two waters, because the licensing system in this state does not yet exist, but possession will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Moreover, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, as the way to maintain a balance between the requirement of state to offer an &quot;adequate access&quot; to the approved marijuana and its ban on carrying out turnover of cannabis in a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, areas of game baby or childhood centres. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;nowhere will be more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorized in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for cannabis legal, a research group recently established. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Oates, the police chief of Aurora, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which they reported that the prosecutor of the city would no longer prosecute for minor infractions for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years and that the police would bring charges against those crimes &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief Oates said that they would enforce the regulations of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that will continue to pursue traffickers and sellers of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, said that his office would pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly for pressure consumers and that will decide to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other objections. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;our office has the obligation to take action against those mistakes that at the time were crime,&quot; said Mr. Buck in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer appointment to adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Hautzinger, district attorney of the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that it is losing time to continue enforcing the law to change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, was never considered that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use the level of government and the judicial system were to be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The mixed reactions that arise from around the state showed a sharp ambivalence among officials about the great experiment environmentalist in this state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;it is a cultural barrier with prosecutors in the district,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing the defendants for possession of marijuana and local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;have spent so much time taking people to court that, in fact, still cannot accept that it &apos;s legal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases at the national level concerning the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also looked eager to receive indications from the federal government, which still requires consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalization of marijuana they hope that the Department of Justice will subside. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Although there have been some high-profile arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed to exist business of selling marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 states more. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;although it is likely that the agents anti-drugs no animal carcasses being left doors dumped below for hijacking a bag of drugs small, probably will be reluctant to allow the functioning of shops controlled by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law&quot;, said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of anti-drugs policy of the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several towns of Colorado are not expect to act federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will be about a year before any of them can open. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the city west of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely to approve the next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;we don &apos;t want to get into a situation in which allow someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are parliament &quot;s in favour of what the community voted to vote in favour of what voted the state.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise in this. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I chased to go to Oxford as a Tory&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It does not address to the students for their points of view only now </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I do not remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a symposium Greek of the modern era that drove the two pillars of civilization: The free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, in the two weeks of taking my place at the Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the career of History, had already packed their bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and fell to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper The Evening Standard asserted that i had abandoned because brooked no which some fellow university maintained sexual relationships in the room next door. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because they forced me to drink in shucked cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less fun. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Huí there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I fled because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my flamboyant name, nor the fact that they come from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Me harassed by a single reason, that in the cradle of the alleged enlightenment was something intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and my supported the conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Perhaps be wondering what comes that now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students center-right is suffering a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The institutionalised hatred and growing toward students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them argued the same level of equality of rights that have gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students from grade) of Corpus Christi College say they are &quot;often badly sections, personally attacked and treated as non grata&quot; by his political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a seat in the committee of equal opportunities of his college to ensure able to express their opinions freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary of the so-called &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; (The paradise: Young, bright and right-wing) on the policy of students and presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of Conservative party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silvery suit and a stick with silver hilt. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students conservatives say that they are treated as &quot;scapegoats&quot; for the introduction of tuition fees higher. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing trend of left-wing universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know us. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 and a student of history in Corpus Christi, who introduced the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and the incoming president of OUCA, said that the attitude of the members of the JCR to people who are center-right has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;this poses a threat to the environment intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of members&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During my first weeks at Oxford I was more than a single. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I entered university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old woman terribly timid. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title of &quot;honorary&quot; after cuts in funding of Higher Education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would have done a estremecer of espanto to any stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the first days of the week to welcome new university, when new students and professors know, I received a sign of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the professors not only did the blind eye to the mockery of the college conservatives, but involved in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The policy of the miners&apos; strike, privatization and the government &quot;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa arrived in the halls of the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first thing that I should translate into English, French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Not di neither one. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a shallow man with a face that seemed mass of sponge cake, knew well how to expel bad bile. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Is that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that, simply, are stupid?&quot; asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other university laughed out. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I burning in the eyes of the tears that sought to contain. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, if and when you are not too busy knowing people,&quot; &quot;Hoessler ordered Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room as a banshee. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat alone at dinner time at university; then I felt a light slap on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a of second year student English called James which was presented as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; said unto me kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;I am afraid that this is how the thing. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Get with whatever suspected of being a Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me it is very complicated, but they know that your father is closest to Margaret Thatcher, so for you will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I tried to cobardemente dissimulate. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I emphasized that he did not agree with everything she said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick was useless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student of first year of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: &quot;you are the daughter of a fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You contaminated. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took the ditty. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I became the perverted dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;how do have sex the Tories?&quot; asked one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> &quot;there are a beating one another, isn &apos;t it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt the same way that should have been homosexuals before the law liberal of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> What Podría someday lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would be forced to be with people who think as I just after dusk? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> What Tendría that have labor and suppress my natural trends? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that I hoped ran as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only Tory was openly professor Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History to my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also Thatcher &apos;s foreign policy adviser and one of the people he wrote his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Hated the place because I believed provincial and insignificant and by his adherence to the vision marxista-determinista of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;here you are not going to be happy,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to commute daily from Oxford home of my parents in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan mindset more open. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> Not I believed. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he was a student there in the 1940s, it accepted all points of view. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;but if it is the best place in the world,&quot; said with sadness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> &quot;they never would do that, not there among my beloved dreaming spires. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> To my friends Communists always had an impeccable attitude. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Their sore eyes began to nublarse. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;give him another chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that they have done only to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I would split the heart if you stopped. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced their faith. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, during a seminar in which another Professor of History had hinted, speaking entirely seriously, that I was a &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Societies of shame on the inside, admití that my parents I had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; and called &quot;old stupid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The truce lasted a short time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my career university in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Then my father wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was nestled inside of fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors duly repented. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they were made the suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Never came back. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps I call weak llorona. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only made up to 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but that, today, hides behind a well-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegance to the renown&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2554"> &quot;I was impeccable, the time is not for him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If you said a princess... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: The human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play the life and health carrying 70 kg of sulphur through steep stone footpaths </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for which his work is hell, and the other, literally, works in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> In the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living removing sulfur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> For this, you have to get to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies it into contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After booting large rocks of sulphur, which in total to about 70 kg, the carries in two baskets of bamboo that burden on his shoulders through rugged stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> They are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to move at a snail &apos;s pace, keeping the balance with defining and measuring his steps to tune and not fall over the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any traspié could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist despeñó years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur that </seg>

<seg id="2566"> This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates since 1960 the volcano, and never better that, to their workers, to which pays of &lt; / p &gt; &lt; p &gt; 11 indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and to launder sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;as usual is charged 70 pounds, we drew some 50,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually three doors daily. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems a misery for so inhuman effort, it is triple what would win in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;the Jornal of the miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; clarifies the carrier, formerly worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>

<seg id="2593"> Singapur seeks babies to save the economy </seg>

<seg id="2595"> &quot;the people of Singapore needs to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic, we meet our civic duty and we believe life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an announcement of pills of mint, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references as &quot;We are going to put a Bao (bun in the oven&quot; to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company that made the video, BBH, harbors the hope that with the notice to draw attention to the problem of a fun way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music for people to meet &quot;their national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is purely internet, so we had to do it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos to ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we must address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, including launch perfumes with pheromones, or arrange appointments (speed-dating evenings). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily work. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not do the most creative possible to solve this problem, which is compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children, </seg>
<seg id="2608"> That is not take it so lightly is the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Spends $1,300 per year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for marriages and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends the licensing abscence). &lt; / p &gt; &lt; p &gt; 1 and distributed tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy and of high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2 -conocida as rate of reposición- was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> As Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;that has allowed it to people have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marry and start a family,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise of unmarried, and to delay marriage and the births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to increase drastically reduce immigration to confront the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore there are websites where there is barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical to maintaining low wages and cannot join. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapur experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences of </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, income tax, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying not to build many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, has started to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority of urban development has gone to control the number of apartments small, known as &quot;shoe box&quot;, which can be constructed in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have had much success of sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of soltería and desanimen discourage developers who want to build large houses, Rooms. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their &quot;boxes of shoes&quot; are sold much faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Are more popular, in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new rules give clearer direction for developers, to which before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Much too stressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city State. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the birth rate national, speaking with Singaporeans who work in the financial district downtown it seems that are not going to have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;the people are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing,&quot; says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;but for me it is important to have with my own money and time,&quot; says another young man of about 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, the stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The private off line is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> And privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the Dictionary of the Real Academia Española it is the quality of private or &quot;the scope of private life that it has the right to protect any intrusion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private to a child under 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in their daily lives and in social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Did it understand the dangers to which it is exposed by venting on the Internet situations that would surely not out of line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Nationwide interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, asociaron the term to &quot;something very mine&quot;, in the plane staff, and &quot;in the key and name of the user&quot;, when applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;my deepest secrets not rise to a post,&quot; said Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which has accounts from two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;they are very secret secrets, my mom may know, but not all over the world,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In FB I upload beautiful images or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also I with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;not share a picture that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures know the 35 friends in FB and their nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I turned to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I don &apos;t know if I answer, I just uploaded,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or friends quickly,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request for an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Nor would case someone to recommend to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Joseph, 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last admits not knowing to 20 people added in his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;it scares me, because we have something in common, the music for example,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, none has hinted nor has asked for the address or phone number from his home. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;if I press or I would simply the sack of my mind,&quot; acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy you are outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> An acquaintance of a my friend they were gouged in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;never knew who it was,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, not closed the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;we just put privacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains a series of steps to configure the account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this guy subiría photos of known in uncomfortable situations or embarazosas. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> It would, if I fall ill or would I have. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;although I know that this is ciberbullying,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos batons, teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, believes that for guiding children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is reporting. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;Internet emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; mentions. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Batons said that the academic Marc Prensky, master &apos;s degree in education at Yale University and author of the work native-born and immigrant Digitales, coined the terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;we are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that the issue is complex, &quot;because we are asking them have a criterion defined on what should or not distribute, publish or say to an age to maturity not da for that&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;also to be selective when what matters is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;tell them not to do not served,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, batons lists some options: There are things that are not contarías to a stranger, why you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, do you &apos;d like to publish a photo of yourself as you published a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other published about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you tag photos of holidays, do you have requested permission to other people to label them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And a more, all they need to know what you are doing each time? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to see that they must act online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;one out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as it should be in social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance, </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Queen of Scots Guard, university professor, teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents read to the policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> To understand each of the subsections they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;for example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> In accordance with Guardia, it is key to remember children the lesson of &quot;no hables with strangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Ends summit of the Unasur without making public the Declaration of Lima </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The VI Summit president of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without being issued the Declaration of Lima, announced previously and theoretically signed by the seven executives attendees. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE repeatedly tried to access the document signed in the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancery and Chair noted at the outset that they were going to surrender after the closure, but later claimed that at some point be published on the website of the Peruvian Government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When consulted by the text, pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Perú, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists access to information of the Summit was restricted at all times. </seg>

<seg id="2709"> The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by press spokesmen of some of of the Unasur the governments attending the appointment, although not the peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media calling for greater data. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the Presidencia of Perú sent an email to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but this is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document which closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In October, Peru was the host of the III South American and Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite being requested insistently by the press, nor broadcast, also called Declaration of Lima, who had previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> In the ASPA official website of can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals&quot;, adding Piñera, and saluted with a apretón of hands to Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents of which will be the ICJ happened then that Colombia reported this week the Pact of Bogotá for which he had agreed to undergo the failures of the international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua was severely flawed. </seg>

<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated of the appointment. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for open deliberations in the morning and close the summit, shortly after noon of Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The trustee read the final document in which he reported that there were 16 deals and set lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements mentioned that the countries of UNASUR &quot;important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the agreements on residence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> Reported that will drive actions to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against insecurity civic and against transnational organized crime, actions to make the medicines more accessible, internet access to low-priced in every corner of Sudamérica, and respond jointly and efficient risks of natural disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not be a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand nustra productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our peoples,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;we have decided to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... joining our countries and generating new cash economy,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a message read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among those projects, mentioned that five of them to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two indicate a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;we hope that the electoral process in this country serve to return to the Union of South American Nations,&quot; which is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was also one of the issues highlighted by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, Colombia &apos;s president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that it expected to meet with your couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat with respect the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with the President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;we will review all these roads, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua&quot;, stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;with the president Ortega I hope I can tell you that we conduct this in the most civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega find themselves Saturday in Mexico, where they planned to attend taking command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Also, as part of the summit, ministers of Defensa of the bloc met previously to approve the Plan de Acción of 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on Defensa in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru holds the presidency pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship &quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that &quot;South America, in this case yes, you must learn from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who took part in the VI Summit president of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that the Europeans &quot;were killed in the Second World War and other conflicts,&quot; but now are practically a homeland. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Defended, in that sense, the project to establish citizenship suramericana that encourage member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;we have to get the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as already happens with members of the Andean Community, but there is still a reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who give lectures were never committed to anything and, on the other hand, us South Americans we signed everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;it is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States,&quot; he said in allusion to the given political asylum by Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa asserted that is not repentant of that decision because with this has not betrayed their principles, but that has respected their &quot;profound democratic values and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Adding that, in its time, &quot;had reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and are not respect his process&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, in addition to the Swedish justice by requiring that are brought into its territory to the interrogation by an alleged sexual offence when &quot;the Swedish legislation allows you to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since that is our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian leader. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What is there is the danger of that of their physical and mental health by being locked in a small space, without being able to do outdoor exercise. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;that complicates the health of any person,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a salvaconducto to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the encierro of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We don &apos;t negotiate with human rights, do not use that word in this case, but there has been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;the solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Garzón Una, is doing a series of procedures in different European forums,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And opined that &quot;if Britain gives morning the passage this is just.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as well as to its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or questions via Skype tomorrow is this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and matizó that what is &quot;not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which distorts the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;the biggest enemies of freedom of the press we are not politicians wicked and perverse but the bad journalists in profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect welcomed that they will no longer be these journalists &quot;neither the bankers nor the hegemons and middle-class the dominant in Ecuador,&quot; and said it to be reelected &quot;deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2784"> The boy hid it to his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take charge only of his illness and began to learn about it; with such efforts already celebrated his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after various battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, until the director of a clinic the IMSS avoided say goodbye to him &quot;because he had a cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignorant of their disease, yet many people arriving where the virus has already caused havoc, &quot;exhausted&quot; his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, &quot;the great achievement means that at this time the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, it is exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectólogo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system of patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best expectation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years ago, when provide 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple terms, this means that whoever receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms &quot;while it remains in control can live without problems until the 75 years,&quot; the interviewee. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> For sizing this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average. </seg>

<seg id="2799"> - A me it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So view, as well has happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have not had desabasto of drug the problem is that patients come very advanced because unaware of their infection, or in the latter stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He gave a resounding: &quot;nine of every 10 patients arrive when already have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is more early diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, all persons who require it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a laboratory particular only motivated because he had done a friend and, despite his young age, was already in phase of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi &quot;s sarcoma, a cancer tumour that is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;if already me&apos;m going to die, better me reviento three times a week&quot;, say not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve, I food well, I exercise, taking medicines. </seg>

<seg id="2876"> Of all, which holds more excitement are those that recall its way through the jeans since the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or seized control of the franchise. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;these were my best years, which I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of jeans since 1967, either as assignee, coapoderado or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships shifted from 1971 until 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Thereafter, took charge &quot;cuckoo&quot; Ortiz, who was a great manager, &quot;said Reyes. </seg>

<seg id="2907"> What you was to be done? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to implement, as regionalization of the categories children. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and set against teams from only other corners of the Isla in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now children travel and play too much unnecessary. </seg>
