<seg id="1"> Republican strategy of resistance to the reintroduction of Obama ’ s election </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified its policy to deal with the spin in the election. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, in the Бреннана believe this myth, arguing that cases of fraud in the election in the United States more rare than deaths from the impact of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Besides lawyers Republicans have counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One can say with certainty: These new trends will have a negative effect on turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American states bear the responsibility for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is why most of the state governments since 2009 pass laws, усложняющие the registration process or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received a new dimension after elections in November 2010, which brought so 675 new locations in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only for one 2011 was taken 180 draft laws that restrict the right to vote in the state. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New election laws require voter to ID with a photograph and evidence of the presence of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws are cutting the absentee voting, the right упраздняют voter registration in the day and take away the right to vote for citizens who have has been removed from official records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections no US state not обязывал voters to present identification with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana has become the first state, which has such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Republican officials rushed to spread this practice and in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they have policies that commit voters to make a photo ID, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, in contrast to the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identification card, as well as medical insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of US citizens, then there are 21 million people, under the necessary for the voting age, do not have a photo ID, from the government body of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> While the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions диспропорционально affect the young, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African American men, 15% of people, easily earn less than $35,000, 18% of the people over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years does not have the required photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that is not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters, which, as it is considered, vote for candidates from Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph, issued by their educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, no state is not required evidence of the American citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time, this requirement has been introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Starting in 2011, more than ten states have laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, obviously, aimed to limit the vote from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is considered, that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws упраздняющие registration of voters on the day of voting in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also have limited the right of individuals or groups to help those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction is not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign to the registration of voters helped make in lists of about 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, brought down by 17% level registering new voters in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition to Republican lawmakers adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of absentee voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted, were moving ahead, even though the last accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with come from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of the voters, they accounted for 24% of the people who voted earlier. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast to the white, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted earlier were only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, lawmakers-Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft legislation was ветировано state governors-democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The most ambiguous laws were halted with the intervention of the General Prosecutor of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This has enabled in part to limit the negative consequences. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So, for example, only 16 of 34 states have laws requiring or photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules who joined the action, of course, will make it hard suffrage in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Criticism from Democrats denounce bias laws, which were taken, seeing in them an obvious appeal to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report from Бреннана 2011 demonstrates that states, these laws are 171 from 270 votes needed in the electoral college, to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one, of course: These new regulations will have a negative effect on turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening prostate cancer: Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test on Majoris gives sometimes erroneous results, лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to бесполезному medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so reluctant to passage диспансеризацию from which begin to doubt even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked opinion two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> A study in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups investigated, so the received data are difficult to interpret and difficult to work out which-or clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time European, found a different level of mortality in those patients who underwent screening, and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also found, after a 12-summer the observation that the likelihood of a метастаз on 30-40% higher than those who did not screened. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So, I would recommend pass test starting from 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men African-American origin also are at increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key point is making the right decisions, as soon as the cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Patient need to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him a possible options, without a prostate cancer treatment, which is safe for life in the long run, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who revealed the cancer will not pass the course of treatment, as their cancer is not offensive and is not a threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We let them offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we start treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we with precision define criteria for deciding who should or should not be course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend all-still pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important consult with your doctor to determine whether or not, it is necessary to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Мовембер created a tool that allows you to assess all for and against passing the test on Majoris. </seg>

<seg id="73"> To prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle-prescription to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite progress in scientific research, the healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is considered, that if all people cool питались and enough moving, 30% of cases рако could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one was smoking, that figure has risen to at least up to 50%,&quot; emphasizes André Болье, the press-secretary of the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by наследственностью. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer remain completely (CDS). </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Association of cancer fighting smoking remains a priority, despite a reduction in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking linked to 85% of cases of cancer of the lung. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It deals huge damage to the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, in Quebec has 1.5 million smokers,&quot; says the press-secretary of André Болье. </seg>
<seg id="85"> The ASEAN Regional Forum fact: Ten years after abandoning Area the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the data of a kind, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus and pancreas and cervix. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Studies show that routine physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer,&quot; - add in Association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The Association also recommends to limit consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Should avoid also sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of the meat by Salad, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The past can damage cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer&quot;, - just follow in the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists on the influence of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But for the moment, the results of these studies could not be called a single. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, research vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed lower risk of prostate cancer, then another gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D and there is no full clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> However, n-Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and the family anamnesis, it is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Interim analysis does not cause cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs boson in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> In the summer of eating a message about what scientists may be able to discover the Higgs boson, provoked a boom, and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is considered, that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, as many. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, this is the latest particle whose existence has been predicted in the framework of the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, &quot;the least imperfect&quot; descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter - but that previously could not find an experienced by. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physicists have still not sure that the question is about бозоне Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles Higgs boson, predicted General model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented this week in one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, that is confirmed, although to some of the data is not reaches. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine all the same, that it is about бозоне Higgs, as well as make chances seem to be minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world one law absolutely inevitable, гласящий that two things may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To work around this rule there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although particle physics is quite strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: The Pauli exclusion principle, which постулирует that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;certain state&quot; is a &quot;state&quot; is, in general, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Proceeding from this, physics of share particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find decent citizens, called фермионами that sensibly are subject to the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In the other, the суетятся бозоны, гнусная Banda anarchists who have no respect to anything – at least to this principle, which means that they can преспокойно turn out to be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website (by the way, absolutely wonderful) Particle Adventure at Berkeley, these бозоны are, in turn, into two groups: Meson, about which we can talk, and we will not force particles &quot;,&quot; through which are the basic forces of nature and to which in some way, Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These same бозоны, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creature, as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly банальному бозону: Фотону, or &quot;fountains of light&quot;, which is &quot;by courier&quot; electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle with the electrical charge, is accelerating or changes direction, it is &quot;violates the&quot; electromagnetic field in this region, roughly as stone, to the pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;human&quot; is born electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than as фотоном - and, therefore, one of бозонов &quot;host forces.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> Much the same is true with бозоном Higgs, with the only difference that to this boson appeared, should be &quot;broken&quot; different field, the Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field is much, much stable electromagnetic fields; to stir up, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, as if it was a pond замерзшем, surface which could offend only a very large stone. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated at CERN is the Large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of the 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field is intended for an explanation of the relationship between бозоном Higgs and weight. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Indeed, not all particles, and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, interact, others is not: A sheet of paper, for example, never itself will not keep in the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who interact, have a lot of, while others (as intensity, by the way) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;can do&quot; all of these studies, asks of membrane-Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science, they are used for testing the accuracy of General Model (SM), and it is also allows physicists find a divergence between the results and forecasts SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Besides, some of them passionately to crave such divergence was found, as the slightest discrepancy could open the door for &quot;a new physics&quot; and former some holes Models. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, however, still have significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which is approximately 80% of the Universe (oops-oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while at CERN such disparities are not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person to predict more difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See: At the beginning of the 60-x ’ s pioneers in the use of the laser research laboratories Bella could not even imagine what the revolution will bring their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They had anticipated their applications in science, but not much more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960 was invented in the laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that the laser was seen more as &quot;gadget lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the application can найтись for instruments, accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this does not was its original purpose, now serves as a &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras and deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;Долг&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed delicate question the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate will soon should be resumed, but at this time is preparing a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this important area, there is still much work to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Debt&quot; tried to take a closer look. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, разрушавший it from within, gave him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years I lived seven&quot;, he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the orphanage of palliative care Victor-Гадбуа in Belœil where arrived on the eve of. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always shock, this is impossible to prepare,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its job: Unbelievable weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even yourself to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees that had helped him to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He бодрится, even manages to smile, to talk with strangers who work around it, bring it, do it in the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in front of a death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is demeaning,&quot; he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found the medicine from this malaise. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of life teaches us that a man should мочиться standing&quot;, - Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the orphanage Victor-Гадбуа. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to the status of a child - for some an unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It all depends on the human capacity&quot; to come to terms with the rebound, he argues. </seg>
<seg id="164"> As, in the opinion of many people engaged in паллиативным departure, important events случаяются and at the height of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come to the shelter паллиативный Victor-Гадбуа, all with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts they look to for a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more aid, called &quot;medical&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> G-membrane A., 89 years, most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of the car.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease which has enabled me to know their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have a good children&quot;, she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing more in my life,&quot; she says, before being allowed to put her mask, облегчающую breath. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It still-awaits in the coming days last visit his son, you from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In the orphanage Victor-Гадбуа with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is паллиативный care, which remains when that nothing can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make the death of more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec on every 11 700 residents have one place in the institutions of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether the comfort of the physical, emotional or privilege. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Police we agree to provide ротовые gurgling of brandy or пепси, he asks. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics we don ’ t impose control the level of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we brought beer, well-X, who died today at night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> In the morning, his son допил this beer in my legs from the late. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help relatives, as well as patients&quot;, - Natalie Savard, director of care for the sick. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the orphanage Victor-Гадбуа nor one day not similar to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to the 93-years old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and all перепробоваший, in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In the last six months from three to five beds, always busy cancerous sick in the age of 45 years,&quot; - озабоченно says Dr. Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients, taken to a shelter Victor-Гадбуа, arriving from home, and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to care паллиативному </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is considered, that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to паллиативному care, you have to care, which is available to alleviate the suffering patients, in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in the orphanage. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-Гадбуа and the Society of palliative care at home the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancerous sick. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this a big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in паллиативному care to fear the adoption of the law, and there are some легализирующего assistance in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October circulates manifesto signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. Балфуром Маунтом and Dr. Bernard Ляпуантом and to indicate their disagreement with a similar initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, health care system of Quebec are not effective, in order to ensure the right to паллиативный care quality before will be allowed to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, - I saw the patient, which has spent 14 days in the ambulance, scary, and no one has taken the necessary steps to their ease. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients are willing to die only because they did not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists till the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Helen Richard have already been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I said my онкологу that I прекращаю treatment, she said, that regrets that I прекращаю struggle - tells it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> At the same time, she said, that my days are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no care all-powerful </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of patients who are asked about death, biomedical, for what they defaulted on their request, after the team on паллиативному care makes their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it should be noted that the паллиативный care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Элси Monroe, director for паллиативному care in the Society of palliative care at home the Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to general anaesthetic in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative седации, in which the patient sleeps till the moment of his death, or from time to time, either. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Can ’ t be more than pretend that we don ’ t know about these suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, with which it is not possible to relieve pain, can have access to palliative седации. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want I spent there,&quot; which means &quot;I want to me was easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this report became possible due to the Handicapped журналистскому research from the Institute of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Motion scandals with the real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system,&quot; опутывающей construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry&quot;, which is very costly taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;Curiously, as рассыпается this system after were started to work in it all means, jokes Jacques Дюшено, MP and former chief of police Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal as a result of the investigation into the official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, on which the Prime-Minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, has agreed a very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;The report Дюшено&quot; has established a direct link between industry, secret financing political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, emphasizes it, one only Ministry of Transport has kept would billion in contracts&quot; if some kept their instincts to take share. </seg>

<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, was made a series of will, and some municipal officials, in particular of 1000 spectators and Зампино Ришару Маркотту - the Mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> In turn, Gilles Vaillancourt, the late resign as mayor de Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> His suspect in неоднократном receiving bribes when government orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, the official indictment was charged with several engineers service of Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Аккурсо and Lino Замбито. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has blown up a bomb, поведав investigations on the &quot;system&quot; of state contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Within a few years, Замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts, in Montreal, any посреднику connected with the mafia, which, in turn, translate money Party mayor Жеральда Tremblay &quot;Joint Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="229"> In 2000-x ’ s Замбито сорил money to the right and left, he listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euro) various parties, mostly liberals, who then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> In addition, he admitted that illegally collected funds for former Deputy Prime-Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Нормандо. </seg>

<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, confessed that were on the leg, завышая account for 30-40% by using false additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one of the parties, the mayor, Мартан Dumont, accused of on-Tremblay is that he deliberately closed eyes to the existence of a parallel budget, наполнявшего party offices dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations of n-Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a deep crisis. </seg>

<seg id="243"> As we убираемся home. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Дюшено notices that officials &quot;stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but especially he worried about the role of the &quot;elected officials interpreted this scheme&quot;, but not participating in the bonus. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the share of dirty money to finance the election campaign in Quebec to 70%, he jokes: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec offers to limit to $100 donations to parties, but, he says, it does not change the situation: &quot;While we will not strictly restrict elected spending, in politics will be dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a system of public contracts and finance parties: &quot;We cannot move below; boldly вникнув in the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legitimacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and casts a shadow over international image of Quebec and Montreal, n-Дюшено calls for those who laughs, to look into its own courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;ПСЖ - not FC Barcelona!!!!!!!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season you in ПСЖ have achieved extraordinary scope. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained individual сознательностью, but can - and the new measurement ПСЖ. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Profit great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them I расту every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technicians also brought a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football, all happening very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I am not распаляюсь. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the beginning, in the centre of the preliminary preparation in the National Investment Fund in Клерфонтене and up to my parish in St-Etienne I always Chagall forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you benefit from competition, the Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> Flea market this summer is not new to play games of the very highest level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that each training is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to the fact that such a player, as I expect to be on the level and contain the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> His deputy, such as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position, as I am. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the owner of a position? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the First League him not equal, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I have with him was обнадеживающая conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I moved from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust, which I have also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season ПСЖ? </seg>
<seg id="279"> During the Lyon took away our leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we still-ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We spectacularly квалифицировались in one eighth final. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, all can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to say their word face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to accept a return match in one eighth final. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether ПСЖ to become the first European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He had to do this, already have a budget. </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and position in the long term perspective. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, it is not so. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially the ПСЖ has the means to make this project real. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the First League last season, will be a failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we valid fervently wish to get this чемпионский title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were to close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, it was disappointing, because we had everything to come to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other team, Montpellier, was even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think, everything will be in order. </seg>
<seg id="302"> In spite of the fact that in the fight for the title entered such strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to defeat. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do not think that you can find the media waiting for too much from ПСЖ? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expect much, given how much has gone and what we have players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are ready to do so. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we home win 4-0 against Troyes and we still find what раскритиковать, of course, this is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what to expect from us. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We do not FC Barcelona!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to implement the project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proved in the Champions League that can respond to modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which already has two seasons are not able to go in one eighth final, although they also spent a huge amount of money!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the invested sum, we you were on 15 points ahead of already for the winter Roman-Catholic church. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would be a dereliction of our opponents and the France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; this new ПСЖ. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how fascinating First League. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we can smile and say to myself that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> ПСЖ seems to be completely dependent on the feats Златана Ибрагимовича. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And what if they say that there is a &quot;Златанозависимость.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ибрагимович very successful and that he забивает many heads. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to do this, and it proves that he star First League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star on a global scale. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In a group we his respect as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects people that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done, it really is. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and other improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have Euro-2012 qualifier against France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I ardently desired to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of the game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw there many things, and I came from there. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I can play good Qualifier matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped since my baptism in photography. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave command. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think about the first months Didier Дешама led photography? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They for him successful. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in the group to the world. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He strict coach, it close with players and inspires for victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has reached its goal, he квалифицировал us in the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will photography in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Good Honored draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain is a basic match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match gave us faith in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each had fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Prior to that, the shock in Spain, in my career had no such games. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between receiving sides with commission fees on their processing. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: The belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, изобретенный Satoshi Накамото (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and secure exchange of protocol for the type of BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the one level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take биткойны for donations or as payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The course биткойна, reaching a maximum 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars before return today about ten dollars (rates are indicated on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special in comparison with the real money exchange or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, has become interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes биткойн as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the common currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies, as &quot;credits&quot; used to promote in a video game, which зарабатываются during the game or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also has developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But the operation always exchange controls and processes which-or the central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In Биткойн all nodes of the network are at the same time, holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers, and покупателыми sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How is this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each deal between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses, like email. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information related to this deal, signed by equipped, using encryption system with a key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to check that биткойны used in a deal, really exist in public had the book, разосланной across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> A key step is the registration of new transactions in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes through the mathematical tasks, разосланной computers, решивший which, as if a central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is about the hashing file, i.e. converting a large file in the digital signature, a short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers are &quot;new&quot; transaction and add it to the Room, before &quot;хэшировать&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as this number found, other nodes can easily check that it properly. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Transaction thus turns out to be нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If to deception user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay two times one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed network - and the other would remain unproved, as they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> Computer, решивший task, gets 50 биткойнов. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to avoid inflation, the regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of биткойнов in circulation so limited 21 million, but they делимы to one стомиллионной that leaves even reserve... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The complexity of the tasks also increases with the increase in computational power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Sites render services Bitcoin, were assaulted and биткойны were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;Used defect does not apply to the protocol,&quot; - assures Pierre Нуаза, which recently launched Paymium - the company осуществляющую payments real money using the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB said about possible money laundering through this this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash also have this disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blog-platform WordPress, their permit. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorith Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed Счетную book and found that almost 80% биткойнов not there are in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Giant sales&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; Jon enjoys Холмквист, working in Coinabul, which deals with the conversion биткойнов in gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Нуаза, another author of benefits for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as operating network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or for payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check the transactions, which thus is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner of better control over your personal data and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, who do not need to install new hardware or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It is enough just to address, which can be &quot;photograph and to recognize the phone,&quot; explains Pierre Нуаза, not to worry, because he has already thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend of hierarchical system in favor of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before Bitcoin утвердится, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review the various risks, now considered elevated, in the case of the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have gone from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What ’ s next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa Province and Суроби). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans must follow at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose its future, hoping only on us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> From us suffered mostly Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we, with 88 of the murdered soldiers, and ранеными and покалеченными. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commanders, Tutsi refugees fleeing in Pakistan, but also often from the peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as it was in the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Their citizens, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will behave more takes. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The French troops from bases Ниджраб, which I watched from the hills засаженных миндальными trees thanks to French credits, took place in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and combat helicopters have reached in Kabul, without being атакованными. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Since the end of the 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since their compelling promotion from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> While Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood of in-fighting between different groups. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Capture them under the control of the country, as it was a kind of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women paid мракобесие these peasants, in which their surpassed Al-Qaeda, but their situation did not improve and in our days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in подчиненном position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned to speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge US contracts субподряда. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited; most of them, by the way, even do not fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not from thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to go, as уедут those who managed to American bounty: The outflow of capital substantial. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul, now there are 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs these young people who do not want to return to the old мракобесию parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including armed militants, like mobile phones, TV and Turkish soap opera that is the modern world, and who look everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment, the army is. </seg>

<seg id="430"> The old commanders, ведшие anti-Soviet struggle, already are taking measures to restore provincial milícias who would not abide by the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country with strong local differences, should be to some extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the post of Prime-Minister of the Constitution, which has existed since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want to foreign control, especially before the election, targeted for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country, starting with the 50-x, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> The industry was not delivered on their feet, no dam not function, no ирригационная system is not renovated. </seg>
<seg id="435"> All imported; nothing is done, except for fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Priority to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country devastated by war, thirty years of state control over the infrastructure would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> There were rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral riches. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It has only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were there, only to take them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without the energy for the processing of iron ore or copper in place, without the means of transportation to their export through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals. </seg>

<seg id="686"> To get the trunk, I need a familiar, which has an exit, tells the seller-consultant. - I so familiar, but I do not believe in it. </seg>
<seg id="687"> Sellers on the markets, but there are also need to come, &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to pass, a daughter of a tooth drops out.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="724"> In recent days in America, a wave of protests against low salaries in the store of Walmart popular restaurants and fast food chains, such as &quot;Макдоналдс&quot;, &quot;Burger King,&quot; &quot;Тако Bell&quot;, &quot;Уэндис&quot; and &quot;Kentucky фрайд Чикен.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> So far, no one is predicting turns this wave in the Ninth Wave or she is in the early stages of выдохнуться. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Stocks have left a number of labor unions and public organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to raising the modest salaries that are ordinary workers Walmart and fast food, suggested the protests is the creation of the trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector is almost no problems movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Stocks began last week, after the Republican Day, so called &quot;/ her Dark Friday&quot;, when America has fallen оргия cheap распродаж easiest millions of обывателей and sometimes accompanied by Mina Zayed Port Authority. </seg>
<seg id="731"> To this day, some workers of Walmart, in which all over the world work 2.2 million people, have left their jobs and пикетировали together with the trade unions and the left activists shops corporations, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle ’ s paycheck. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart trades all over the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many низкооплачиваемые Walmart workers отовариваются only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporate America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods sell-off partly because little pays its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Recent also complain about harsh working conditions, for example, on a lack of diesel or handheld scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the shares in the &quot;/ her Dark Friday&quot; required to raise salaries and having sex with the fact that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Editor, Walmart employee получающему 9.5 dollars per hour, the consumption of unaffordable, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley Californian argue that if Walmart worked will pay up to $12 per hour, it would cost corporations in 3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is roughly 1.1% more than it spends on salary now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth at the expense of customers, then each visit to the shop will do them all on 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year, they will spend on what then-12,39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of a Walmart note that protests have occurred only in nine states and not corporations nor малейщего damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and for this time Walmart sold about 5,000 products in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its cash machines produced in &quot;/ her Dark Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Representative of Dan Фогелман argued in an interview left the Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees, and that the protest was all-навсего &quot;another пиаровским трюком&quot; организовавшего its trade union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free desk!!!!!!!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New-York, where they were not subject to the department stores Walmart (in this progressive town not favour, and therefore their here as long as there is no), and &quot;Макдоналдсы&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Макдоналдс says that he sells billions of portions, and after that it does not even gives you the hospital and not pays you for an honest job!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Джумейн Williams, a member of the city council New-York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment the minimum wages, according to federal and нью-йоркскому legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants for the increase, but these are not statistically significant differences, and an average of their ordinary workers receive in New-York 8.90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less them in this expensive city not earns. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can you be in New-York on such money for me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> When then-through &quot;Макдоналдсы was&quot; almost a quarter of American teenagers who подрабатывали for their always after school, living with parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few saw in that the main source of food or planned linger there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I constantly наталкиваюсь on interviews with workers &quot;Макдоналдсов&quot; who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even feed on her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum of Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author who notices that irresponsible to get children, if you do not know what you have to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants of the protest, which began at 6.30 on Thursday at the &quot;Макдоналдса&quot; 40-long street and the Madison-Avenue, demanded that кассирам and across fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is more than have doubled their current minimal earnings. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the sphere of fast food were created trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The American law forbids the administration to prevent and prosecute activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But to reach a labor union fast food is difficult and objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main is unusual. </seg>
<seg id="766"> His </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day at a rally &quot;Макдоналдса&quot; next to the Times-сквер, which gave a few local politicians-Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council Джумейн Williams, an answer: &quot;Макдоналдс&quot; says that he sells billions of portions, and after that it does not even gives you the hospital and not pays you for an honest job! &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrators have supported and other prominent нью-йоркские Democrats, for example, the candidate for the mayor of the city of Bill De Бласио, an answer that &quot;we must we engage in support of fast food, so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every нью-йоркец!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As has described what happened New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it was only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid общепита, in which in New-York busy tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> While it is unclear whether it will spark a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;As long as the fool the brain is middle&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technologies theme added reality lately is seen mostly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First, in the summer, at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> But out of the conversation with a group leader interactive 3D-technologies in Кэмбриджской laboratory Microsoft Шарамом Изади follows, that for this company points - in the past. </seg>
<seg id="777"> Their entices the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Tell, please, in general, than in your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are human interaction with machines, but try to раздвинуть borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> While mankind in the masses are, in general, stuck at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья in them the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We would like to look at 5-10 years ahead and foresee any major changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, PlayStations and Xbox Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, in fact all interesting жестовое management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What else is waiting for us to come? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite the fact that Kinect endured interaction on the physical level, much still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Input information improved (the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not yet very much. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to this change, are working on a truly a display systems on the basis of different technologies, including проективных. </seg>
<seg id="787"> You need to release the computer world in our, physical, make it more concrete. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this purpose, however, need to recognize not only, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A popular thing, but not переоценивают whether her? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - it certainly is not a panacea, the question arises privacy, because it is not always want to let others about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but in their own niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the management of devices in public places we have was the project, in which we thought over gestures, but not over размашистыми, and on being parsimonious, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> It ’ s not a gestures, and наручным браслетом, who recorded the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> As long as he does great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of wrist watches. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture of + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - This is how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, as you ask me to give you this bank газировки? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say, and at the same time a. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - On, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Does it mean you want to get users to adapt under what may or may not at the moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - The first Joe, but not necessarily a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable more accurately determine the reaction. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give it a good resolution in depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensor, which you have claims against the modern holders? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Lack of depth or even what-you? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation is, from what we can build our work on трехмерным recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it is good to 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 to / from. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not the мегапикселях, and as a matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> With the last point of view, all the current technologies for us is not good, it adds to the work of designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> That is to be remembered not only about the resolution on axes X, Y and Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The man is a dynamic, and the current 30 to / from the frankly 2000, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Бетишес from our Рэдмондской laboratory made сенсор touching with adjustable delay treatment - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how this affects the interaction of humans and machines. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my work was the equivalent of such a device, but does not require касаний to frames per second was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - A number of cameras to increase does not need? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - In Kinect now has three &quot;camera&quot;, one of which actually - the IR radiator and the second - receiver reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And this is already the third chamber is, actually, the usual сенсор visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras would solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate it, increasing the volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create flexible counterpart, Kinect поиграться with camber of cameras and see how it will help in determining 3D. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Do I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not public provision of their points. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You do not think that from the point of view of everyday use technologies added reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the time, разгуливать holding smartphone in of raised hands, not very convenient, but that is what I think: The steep option would be &quot;passing&quot; augmented reality, when on the basis of cloudy platform you could switch from points on your smartphone, projection screen and then everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points is a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you can see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - blanks for a second that manipulation of the virtual голографическими objects in the air is available not only Tony Старку from &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also simple смертному. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one problem, which often point critics of such an idea: No tactile feedback!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel nothing!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group is preparing for this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In their lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh in a breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth may well be additive тактильных sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a substrate for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It registers you!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is a technology that is really aimed at giving this &quot;images in the air&quot; осязаемости - for example, atom directed a number of rays at a certain point, where finger, gives the feeling, but it is very weak - as if you blowing on the pillow. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bracelets on the wrist that affect the nervous in detail is also promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To think that he feels that seems to be should feel at the moment when it is that then-sees? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - Now is a good idea, we have not tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another task, over which to fight for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is on an open, almost infinite - work and concepts jogging (not such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, to lie to the brain, which is still very for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is what makes the work on a virtual reality so attractive to the explorer is many things is absolutely in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Instead of Вкусовщина - Росбалт.ру </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Long&quot; continues to project &quot;vanguard of Saint Petersburg&quot;, dedicated to the kings of Poland, which are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In the top-list already are bright figures art-scene in St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the All-Russia fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> A new hero &quot;Росбалта&quot; - эпатажный artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city knows Cyril Miller is a bearded man, dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable parties and вернисажах. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Picture Cyril Miller always collect crowds of spectators, where they would not exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of a St. Petersburg socially-philosophical сказочников, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a man of the vanguard of the late 80-x - the beginning of 90-х. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of the city, to the emergence of the streets calling smile locals, поднимающий all mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently in the hands of took шарманку and became the шарманщиком as ripe for this difficult role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, and why you could still all-around the city in the red, not in yellow and turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose red as a designer, and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, имиджмейкером and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in society all that a little-just not the gray, causes aggression and arousal witnessed properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed at that, in order to begin a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when you realized that should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - On the DK Nevsky Prospekt, where were entered my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that it my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then a wave of old free unofficial artists, and the new, free like me were unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I began to play with the artists new wave, with постгазоневщиной that led to &quot;that-10&quot;, and more waves. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I throws in a theater, clothing, music, in all genres, in addition to the speech. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all this joined in your Art-clinic... - I was important очутиться in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where must assemble all the best creative force. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the for-10, and there, until it was, there was a musically-artistic club, bohemian club, the house at the St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many there were born: Номы, Текила-jazz, remember, as string led with the project &quot;ear Van Gogh Museum.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang under veneer light songs, they were in обтягивающем Tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor Вдовин. </seg>

<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was a leading many programs to hale-галивских times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Трахтенберга, and went to his great career, and basic education and upbringing it we have received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery &quot;D 137,&quot; club &quot;Griboyedov - it echoes of the Art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There our employees and the habitués are gone. </seg>

<seg id="879"> In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was &quot;People of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;artist of the year&quot; was named I, while my climax. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years easily become popular, but the culture and the popularity of change, you may be popular, but not very-the cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your works is characterized by recognizable manner. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my work is hits, bright expressed the urgency and the microscope. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be the program exhibition, &quot;The Russian museum in the clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used to social was now be so - it is painful and scary. </seg>

<seg id="892"> But his hand to be and therefore рожу. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception will be removed with the help of play. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - A recently we have seen you in the role of the urban шарманщика. - Culture city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, like me, not to be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Well can and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>

<seg id="898"> Goes disintegration. </seg>
<seg id="899"> People used in сбивались flock, and one loved, простаки more. </seg>

<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing is they are not deceive, not to spoil the нажитое. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in his youth such paintings that one collector on the wall next to the Фальком and Ларионовым hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, which usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say: The culture of spiritual, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, it from another opera. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a person culture yesterday, grew by examples of artists, who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I for this here is culture. </seg>

<seg id="916"> - good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a thing: Official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can be culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When the right tsars all wrong, kings, can, do not really understand the culture, but they understood that need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here in Moscow is now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg, which could be experts, but they задвинуты as need higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and give them the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thrives вкусовщинка. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they are what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are artists who must seek to other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is for you - St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg - it is not cultural capital, in Moscow culture, there is much more ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones art grow difficult. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, a lot of people любопытствующих. which go on exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have the same this layer to find some rationale. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project was implemented in the grant St-Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> To give birth to in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or clash with an asteroid strike-killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Karakul sheep spacecraft with землянами on board to search for the planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, there is the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think that the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact these planets only two that you can develop at least a hypothetical. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;This Venus and Mars,&quot; said senior researcher of the Astronomical Institute (Штернберга П.К. ГАИШ) Vladimir Сурдин. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if on Mars conditions more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperature 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Live can only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Even half a century ago, conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then - spacecraft in orbit insects, tiny fruit flies-дрозофил. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, into space sent eggs перепелок to check, as a developing embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get to withdraw completely normal them. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But further begins the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is connected with the fact that this Lorca must find support, he should stand on their legs and start moving&quot; - explains Head of Laboratory of the Institute of медико-biological problems (ИМБП) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladimir Сычев. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, chicks randomly кувыркались. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours of the newborns was full atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks have not responded to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that through four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And two times we вылупляли, then refused to, because it is simply impossible for them to work&quot;, stated the failure of the experiment with птенцами in space Vladimir Сычев. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With animals last time biological &quot;миниковчег&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But on биоспутнике &quot;Bion&quot; will only gay individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Was an experiment with rats, which would be sent as space with fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is not found opgedeeld. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It just was on-again биоспутниках, but that is only one experiment, and such research must be carried out,&quot; said Vladimir Сычев. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing at space rats appeared posterity. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But the approach to the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, for habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> People, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create подобающий emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> On ethical grounds similar experiments. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women into space fly for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was at Tereshkova ’ s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious that humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Chaika flew, and no one on the Earth could not say whether it will continue after the flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether it is to give birth to a child after that. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Because this question no one answered,&quot; says the veteran ракетно-space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June, 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child Андриян Mykolaiv was also cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut-Svetlana Савицкой, twice побывавшей in orbit and even continued in open space, my son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little units are astronauts, who after a long flight, and was still growing healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if more, then this is dangerous, even with orbital flights,&quot; - summarizes them-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, the world it is necessary to search for what then-new ways in biotechnologies, protect against radiation, creating an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> NII Гидролаборатория - a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in the conditions of zero cells cosmonauts are honed skills in open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, and comfortable, but all-still чуждая Wednesday, then for infants, native. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ихтиандры if confirm - life on land of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between what the baby is about 9 months, mother in окоплодной fluids, it is easier to get to the then водичке. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, is only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is a very little to what-you forget,&quot; says instructor грудничкового navigation Marina Aksenov. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the child born weightlessness more natural state, for women - need gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles of a stomach, pelvis, the ability to if the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, okay, опустим and this, relying on stimulants patrimonial activity. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special chamber to go at birth, вытолкнет it. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And what?&quot; - sets some non-trivial questions Valeri Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, your child is an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Not that of gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and the muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn baby in orbit is impossible, as an adult, wrap up in a special enabling costume for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of what it will be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment, in which we will go with the birth of a baby in чужеродной environment, will lead to the fact that we are a completely дезадаптированного on Earth, a disabled person&quot;, - expects to be the head of the Committee on bioethics ИМБП Russian Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Until the birth of children in space - the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after time, this will be a reality, when земляне on their boats will go to distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the security check-ревизионного management: Checking Schwartz-system failed to politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement Czech Republic has a good body control and, despite the presence of high quality legislation, is falling behind in its use. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme security check-ревизионного management, from an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be an ideal, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we do not have the&quot;, commented on the current situation Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Similar conclusions provides joint inspection Czech and German authorities control. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices have approach Petra Нечаса to so called Schwartz-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, Prime-Minister stated that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs audits - leaves is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should be what-either way out, and if it is that then-bans, and prime-minister can not stand up to the work of the institutions, which are expected to check and seek to meet their obligations,&quot; stated Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the ревизионного Committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between Czech and German parties, within the framework of which it was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What, exactly, was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> In a parallel testing, which we started perhaps two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question is about the fact that European legislation asserts, how should go public procurement, the national legislation and then also application in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All the information was collected and, even with the still unfinished test, were found out interesting differences - in short, legislation, we can be &quot;accurate and unmistakable&quot;, but in practice we on some parameters give in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows, therefore, that it is not enough to create more and more with the rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> As well as this project can help you, what it means for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is such a joint control can contribute to efforts to stop specialize pass laws, cutting and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy of means receiving appropriate things for sensible (but not always) low price, to avoid the enrichment and perhaps criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But that is not the fact that we do reach, reducing restriction orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system переполнится &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will be to find them much easier than if the restriction does not have decreased. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems of practical application of the law on State purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> But as functions control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Whether there is there such an organization as our KRU (security check-ревизионное management) or it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for institutions, there as our KRU is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged in our principle, there is also a panel of working on a little-to another, but mainly both institutions function similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the authority to some extent are similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is the audit and at the level of federal lands - in this their system of several different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can manage only federal money, we have a state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled on the federal level, the Accounting Chamber. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local legislation, there is easier than us? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would not have wanted to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can take over a sample, but cannot be definitely say that it is better to do everything. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> So, because they know it control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I do not like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But we should say that even the main countries are faced with many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not receive any advantages of cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> If to speak about the domestic legislation, as reflected in your facility amendments to the Law on State purchases, which then-way are the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the legal force these amendments rather short, it is not in our work to control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we have control over the fact that it is necessary to consider some of the delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take this into account only in the process of training future inspections - we started to use our new tool &quot;risk of detection неэкономности&quot;, through which we turned away nearly 14,000 public contracts. We analyzed. There, of course, these changes will be, because the change, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> How do you think, claim that the law will benefit or additional strain on the system bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law, of course, is a step in the right direction, and, I hope, this подтвердится. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem, which can occur, is such that the rules of the &quot;ужесточатся&quot; and they will not be to follow. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> When the functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises are related to the supplier (for example, the regional operational programmes - with regional council) that any failure to public procurement law means violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether in this case the enforcement of the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that is not the way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake, not influencing the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then, how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us know that this path will not lead. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, Prime-Minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs audits of so called Schwartz-system. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz-system&quot; prohibited or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be what-either way out, and if it is that then-bans, and prime-minister can not stand up to the authorities, which are expected to check and seek fulfillment of obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You might say: &quot;We are going to change the law and will let it&quot;, but one can ’ t say that will pretend, as if nothing happens. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> Public procurement law contains very stringent rules, as well as what should formally take place, and this is right. This will protect public procurements. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only from-for formal shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be an ideal, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads in the slippery, but mainly проходимы. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some places, the Czech Republic and the snowy roads frozen beasts perished. </seg>

<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague will, Chinaski Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with dan judo player Bartha, The (STC) (STC), Marjan Bangor, Morbihan and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> About all the details can be found on the website of www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Whether you plan which-or similar &quot;grandiose event&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, will for the first time to speak at the &quot;Prague Spring&quot; and, of course, will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> In the next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech national house in New-York, and I personally, we will be in the United States, it would act in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The group The STC (STC) is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> As you справляетесь with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics?? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> This is not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five participants on electric wheelchairs., their stroller should travel in the luggage compartment of, plus everything a large number of cargo and boxes with tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, while inquired as to this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airlines British Airways have always been excellent for us, how many times I stuck. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes to invalids and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With than you were to present moment? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where all the works better than we have, in Russia, we have witnessed what in the east is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague in Moscow too many barriers, and here is still in wonder independent movement to electric wheelchair in the centre of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also there is not to turn such banal things like to cede the road инвалиду in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, and there are already there are public organizations that are trying to draw the attention of the people on the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what, on the contrary, we are constantly need to catch up to the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things, the execution of which far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to specify that improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is that people with severe form of disability to move on the streets, can go to the toilet, in the museum, where you want... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There are not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are taking an active part in public life, in which we them with The STC (STC) a little ahead of the!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment, when among us will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then all indeed begins to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> As long as this individual cases, people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The STC (STC) currently is very popular, but let ’ s get back to two years ago, that in 1998, you forced her to organize? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered the Institute of Едлички as tutor, around me was a lot of young people who wanted to than-anything to do. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I was a musician and play the saxophone, along with colleague organized an interesting musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, over time, says our leading Ладя Angelovič, it is a little in-control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I that then-путаю? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, we helped that we have begun to join the famous stars and actively working on propaganda group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, in fact as if there is no. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Due to the funds of the European Union can we afford qualified teachers, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Stood there before you is so well unleash The STC (STC)? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do that then-extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In the Show-business is full of things, подражающей one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, all new accepted with care, and lasts that long. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few rare things, but I dare say that STC (STC) is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression from a person who we see, of course, pity, it is of course... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity of completely излишня, because people with disabilities are not what then-affected and all abandoned by individuals, which we must regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who can live a full life and, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities that-then it turns out, this shift, not only for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Guaranteed if the success of what you strict manager, what you believe many? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the job, and we should be in many things hard-line and keep a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I believe that this is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people to us come with romantic representation and fly in the face of the clouds, and aware that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it happens to any group that wants to work and what-you to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> At present the group The STC (STC) twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> As it was in the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Ладя Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and will power, our door is always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> He held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday in 20.12.2012 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium, the Incheba in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the heart of Plynojem with the participation of the 12-ti groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the concert all three cities joined телемостом at the moment of execution of STC (STC) &quot;The End of the World is cancelled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The goal of this project is to collect financial resources in the amount of 25 million kroons for purchasing multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for educational center at the Institute STUDEO Едлички in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> This ticket on the concert is 400, for children up to 12 years. Free entrance tickets can be purchased in advance in Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was a member of the twentieth of the European Space Agency and the country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and over the next years took an active part in a number of projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the path to the space Poland started much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but this is not always were. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Mind you, for example, about the lectures A. Штернфельда, which on 6 December 1933 represented in Warsaw the astronomical observatory ideas from his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (1905), he left the audience indifferent, after several years of Штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Jan Гадомский was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 in France Штернфельд won the award Robert Эсно-Пельтри and Andre Luiz Хирша for &quot;Introduction to космонавтику.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Гадомский (1899, 1966), which described above, later became a great пропагандистом astronomy and space science. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books, dedicated to the scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Гадомский became known world пропагандистом space science, and his contribution was appreciated by including the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway дрезина, missile attack engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as the details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear, even to disperse or for braking carts should be used rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this дрезине known only from the press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933 the Polish artillery began thinking about missile Стрелах. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Research at the department of technology in conjunction with professors Мечиславом Вольфке and Gustav Мокжицким. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining materials, you can see that studies reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops works were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in the specialized press came up with this idea of the photovoltaic missile-fighter, which offered engineer Рогозинский, and next year is the work of &quot;Воздушная rocket-торпеда and aviation rocket-bomb&quot; author Леливы-Кживоблоцкого. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war all projects of military use of missile technology in Temporary scientifically-Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work of over-for the outbreak of war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The following scientific work, dedicated to the aerospace, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, the society is mentioned in the November issue of the journal &quot;Problems of 1954,&quot; in which are published four 3D articles on астронавтике. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, Professor M. Суботович offered to organize society that will be космонавтикой. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time, have already increased projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is an industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> From the beginning of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ПОА) tried to join the international federation Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of ПОА became its actual member of. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And in the next year, the first chairman of the Kazimierz ПОА Заранкевич (1902 - 1959) became a deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> On this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956 ПОА brought a significant contribution into the development of the highly successful meteorological missiles RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish, выполнившей scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Rocket, able to overcome the distance 1800 m, was in the length of about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently was built improved version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on Бледовском пустыре were conducted tests two-stage missiles RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was in the length of about 1.4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile was already in a state with a real scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring high-rise wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962 further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Continuation of the first missiles such as the RM became rocket Meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Rocket was conceived as двухступенчатая, its total length was 510), and the initial weight - 95.7 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Has developed three type (defined as Meteor-1A, -1В and -1С) that differentiated the size of the camera for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Meteor missile-1A had a net space of 0.4 l, Meteor-1В - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0,62л. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Maximum range from all three types of was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 years in the Aviation Institute took place the development of missiles Meteor-2, and its first flight testing began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor missile-2 with the initial weight 380 kg was able to deduce a cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then were built versions of the Meteor-2Н and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Should also mention the entry of Poland in КОСПАР (the Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee КОСПАР two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, within the framework of the Interkosmos, Poland participated in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir Ремека. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The law on public works is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The decision sparked a lively debate in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issues with the broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result of the significant difference in the value of the labor force (wages) is the price. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept to be understood, when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition, &quot;&quot; is pushing the cost of a competitor to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared to other, high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including produced them unemployment, the inevitable rise state spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of Messrs. entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for social, economic and social damage done them in pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that do not need to give specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Бесцеремонные methods of private capital create economies at the level of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce social level of its population with the purpose of attraction in the country of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments have their own population to their private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> It reflected the changes in the current legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is economically make their beauty beauty people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment, and at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor laws. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of the increasing poverty, and at the same time, and the difference between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany for several years there is public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves of their own. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people are already close to one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occur in cases where the employed people get a salary that the state they must register that they were living wage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> This scandal has become known to the public, and in the case of additional employees the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people, under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it did in the 19th-century meters, or exist on salary нищенскую on the margins of society, in the hope that when-first in the country will come the private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But bioinformational abilities, from where he will undertake? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or it will not come in general, as well as Chinese, Indian, the Brazilian, Turks, марокканец, an Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of their own, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not senior executives of action to intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Next, you should answer the question is not whether the private capital, is now almost managing politics and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Unambiguous answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of almost almighty and the omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have безысходную situation проявляющуюся in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministry of-for lack of funds is assigned to the development of bills private law firms, which tightly linked to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then these bills argues Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the western type, but the financially-powerful groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious, that liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation the beauty, as described in the Аппианом work &quot;The crisis of Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The state has long breaks up, and authorities are engaged in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal getting into with the help of stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption have flourished without any bans, and street went on the elections with a previously sold voice &quot;...&quot; decent people not candidates for the position of head of state, in the end once the state for eight months left without Consul &quot;....&quot; seriously began to talk about what the only saving in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for the choice of an energetic person &quot;.. Appian thought that it will be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy towards autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in the modern society is dominated by its own reckless without taking into account the interests of the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is no different from the past: Unparalleled decline or-elite, without any efforts to reform itself deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> It means that the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy type can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected next tour. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Above all tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social population level. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this trend is systemic in nature. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is the target of political and social reforms that will strengthen the vast part of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken a monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Laboratory chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;From the violence does not work, and never could get&quot; - Sting, the song &quot;fragile&quot;, where the main verse various are the words: &quot;Do not forget what we fragile&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused a lot of responses. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position by the fact that he has the right to defend itself, but the Palestinians are in the role of the terrorists, other support Palestinians, arguing that racism Israeli state, genocide, perfect over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings is, and who the victim, in the end, today ’ s Israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not been witnessing the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to offer readers peek behind the curtain, look at that, first of all, who are already длящееся 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning is historical facts, some of them developed on the basis of my own understanding of who or what a group of people is the main driver of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is first and foremost the story of a power struggle. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these people are completely independently of their action steps, or for their троном who was then-, who has guided their actions to advance the set goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Should admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and liabilities arising out of them, the authorities could not happen for the lives of one generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically rich families, one that could be seen as head спрута (do not know whether who then-over them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschild family. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Many of them do not write. </seg>

<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the destruction of&apos;s monarchical leaders in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial dominance, particularly the United Kingdom, and the third is to reduce the world ’ s population to around 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (within may not be nothing, except as a prerequisite for this project) and final of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method, which has a team of the world ’ s richest families headed by Ротшильдами, is the challenge of crisis and subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are sure and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the EDF, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they have managed to untie the war by the assassination of Habsburg heir австро-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, starting большевистскую революциию. </seg>

<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the &quot;evacuation&quot; Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To the legend was reliable, journals were on the film, at the press-conference, a fictitious manufacturing company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details about the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film Аффлека is a special blend of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political thriller, so called &quot;film-киноопус&quot;, the story of a successful, skip the scam is an example can be a series of films about friends Оушена. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film is constantly changing mood - on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes of the Tehran (Segodnya newspaper reports show significant historical photos of events and how those same situation demonstrated in the film - large differences in this not). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the production Hollywood Emmerich, Venetian with irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>

<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the entrance of the scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when the where-then suddenly changed history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues reach in scenes of fictional (a fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar). </seg>

<seg id="1368"> Lack of &quot;Argo&quot; is рассеянность associated with the need for showing too much events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues really обаятельны, but their characters deserved would be more space, and they are in the film is far from the only. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Аффлека lacks a little drama, this film, which you can watch with interest, in assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating триллеры seventies. </seg>

<seg id="1384"> Interests lobby: For example, bananas higher quality in the EU should reach lengths in 14 cm and not dare to be &quot;аномальную curvature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> At the same time, the European Commission оправдывалась that only harmonizes existing separate national rules, which as complicating its trade. </seg>

<seg id="1392"> Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists &quot;(&quot; The principle of laissez Faire), proposed to vote, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, the EU is about the size of food reserves in the territory of the membership of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently, the Czech Republic has, for example, installed the canned mushrooms, for which she faced a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The reports also are interested in and the idea of some countries to pay for what they have, and the idea of providing subsidies to a statement about obtaining subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea. </seg>

<seg id="1400"> For the Czech Republic is located far from the ports, the EU, according to Паласу, should have to pay hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission has gone to the Czech Republic, the tender for purchasing of grain from countries that have no outlet to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies to receive subsidies offered the theater, the Ministry of Regional Development, руководимое minister Paul or German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies should have to go to make statements on subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: All orders are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the resolution in countries-members can easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation, as well as a more efficient operation and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU subsidies on projects that are not even a hint of what then-general with the deepening of European integration, but which state-members have achieved when discussing budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Causes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identity of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest. </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Mr. Senator, as a person comes in the head to run for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I do not think about the invitation to become a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If at us in the country all function without problems, then I would not be for you. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I no longer can watch how over the past 20 years the country разворовывается, as here суетятся thieves, people raise taxes and retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when that see-what I do not like it, you try to find a solution, as they change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was four years old and I am an independent person, not related to what the party, I have no other influencing things but to run for the senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have got, but soon went to the presidential castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Not поворачиваетесь you in such a way back to the people that you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I said that включусь in fight for presidential castle depending on the outcome of the elections in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I pointed out that if I am elected senator, will run for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not a post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need to have had the most impact and the broadest powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But it is not just that we as a nation ропщем in the bar or the TV, but are willing to trample any who try to that then-change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Adding to the media that the person очерняют, and which confused freedom of expression with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was adviser Jiří Пароубека. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Go to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the presidential castle you started with тезисами about material and prosecution of politicians and the return of property is responsible for the sum of more than 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> In order to do it, you need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You have no powers such as president, and only a senate may propose legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbied to conducting Excursions became free enterprise, it managed to move. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is политиканстве - when who-that comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately process obstacles, and it contains citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent беспартийного person I have much greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage in that I without party раскладывания ceasing to, without regard to the tenets of its can take each party that is the best for our country, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You are a man, more to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the point of view of it seems to me that people are more likely to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, not at all important - a little to the left or to the right a bit. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we went ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not that the who-that refers to the right, and who then-on the left, I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always here any good for society, will offer its КПЧМ or GDP, and I just am against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You злитесь who, when then-says that you populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But do not prove whether you are what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business-plan for firms, you also have the what-the ideal purpose and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And to this you try to come closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all the proposals, which I say, already operate in the world, or about them say prominent experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of parliament, you will remain only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with this in politics you long not pride. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk to them, then you can realize criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure away them on their side, so that we have achieved its. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, it was not the problem would be to organize a television broadcast, in which I will appeal to председателям parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they, in case of refusal, will have to inform, why do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If it will be a strong personality, which - abuses, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president, it was to pressure from the public. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Speak directly, what I like, not a genius, and not an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to find allies, to defend the beliefs and views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I only beginner in politics, and for his program will try to get the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Things I try to promote themselves; in that case, failing that, after six years of finish and later in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> This is, in part, it sounds as if Окамура must save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one I don ’ t make, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to stand in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to Радиму Янчуре, he refused to in connection with a large amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Also I at least supported leading investigation journalist Jan Лоренцову, which exposed fraud with light fuel oil prodicts. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward his candidacy because people did elsewhere, but now I feel themselves on traditional. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of people do not have gone on the elections, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Independent of us in the Senate only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for direct elections for mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the basis of own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> About it I have not thought, because I have no time to check the past each potential workers, and I have no money on this. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money, and in the presidential election campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about property proclamations, and how are your own business with this? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Personal wealth estimated at approximately 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague, worth approximately $25 million, the apartment on 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, art collection of roughly 10 million, Aston-Martin on the 3.5 million and Skoda plant, in a million, and even a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way Aston-Martin I have appeared, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked the Bond, who traveled by car, was галантен with women and, at the same time, fought against the villainy and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You on Aston-Martinet, own property on 60 million and you have no money to campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the republic, but their own money and do not want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincingly. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15-ti million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I must inject themselves into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In a campaign I already has invested $2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not as interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Spending on campaign I in fact will cover сенаторская salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But on this money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay son for English school, which is 30 thousand monthly. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted only to earn money, so you would not stated. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Thus, you will be engaged in business, to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Do not you said that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, its activity I partly reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, managing director of spring will be my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like to that I was бессребренником, which will keep the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to then-live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> But, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to receive monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From 200 to 400 thousand that get further. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I became president, then their business would be finished. </seg>

<seg id="1520"> But the most important thing - in Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: The collective of the Boy in the Plastic Bubble for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Here only one elevator, taking place in the heart of the, in fact true fans of architecture and reading prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Остекленное from all sides - bright and easily foreseeable, floors from обожженного bricks and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban area. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Urban environment is revived. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> View unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually book shelves are along the facades, and is located in the middle of a dark room, as a rule and неуютный безликий,&quot; says вини Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We put the classical configuration space from legs on a head and pulled zone for reading from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> An internal space book mountains used skillfully: In the center are offices, Internet-library, chess club, Environmental Centre and technical facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Especially with black book shelves, which serve the workmanship of the walls, then парапетами, then very railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their views, texture and the smell of unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even sophisticated architects and engineers-builders are lost in effect, what it is for unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We have sought to work with secondary materials,&quot; explains Joop Трауборст, manager of the project, a community of Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And as the-times on the same agrarian company in Friesland we have met the right a byproduct of agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as lining under roots used artificial волокнистый material thick thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textiles serves as a one-two of the season, then you can emit. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library is a canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was спрессовано in the thickness of the four this year. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the action of heat and pressure so called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material to smell a little like a new car and a bit of running shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top are 105 footsteps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> The one who wins over a length of almost 500 metres, will be rewarded in the literary cafe is not only a fantastic views of the city, but also Dutch крокетами and its фикусами in. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere, and in the first place on the correct humidity on literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> The costs of a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, represents the ideal project in terms of the environment,&quot; says Троуборст. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For its heating and cooling uses of the land. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the book is the Bell Jar, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Wide farms from laminated wood, located across, give a shadow and take up most of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate in the room are very nice. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Спермон, was featured above скептик from IT, have already visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Лизетте Верхайг also was already here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> As well as преподавательница traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which called Букенберг &quot;soul Spijkenisse, which have long been missing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: For a few weeks before the opening each inhabitant of received an invitation to donate one book from its own collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books should take the blank space on the shelves have not yet fully equipped libraries - at the time it was 70.000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea of work. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves заставлены with. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than полупустая library&quot;, says the architect вини Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that thanks to our invitation now each inhabitant of some way connected with this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional slang called the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And if they are very young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It is only the starting point for building identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;The Germans should play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabó, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic path. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of Palestinians to obtaining observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that the American position it also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence is not speaking too critical toward Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on a prohibited area for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> In the end, NATO conducted this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The point is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, led by the US, to actually German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans is not a single coherent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them that they will be expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only sounds its role, but are on the way to more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such foreign policy, which is France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What specifically means &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> This willingness to take in its national interest, not one dependent on the position of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The economic interests of Germany largely differ from those of other major countries, and that is why Germany must defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Whether these were affected by economic interests in position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> In-first, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> So it must be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not attached to too little, it is not completely biased. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, aimed at making important decisions, such as a vote of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the US ’ s understanding of the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I do not think that this was the same dramatic надлом, as in Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany even will thus a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It is signaling that it should be seen as a serious player in the international arena and that with its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are various opinions about the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, clearly have voiced support for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There is the differences of opinion between the United States and many European states? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In America ’ s domestic policy such differences exist. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, can not openly to hold such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant divergence of opinion is not so significant, as always seems to be. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime-minister of Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, непротиворечивая European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot act as part of a broader approach and forced to instead to act, relying only on their own vision. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> It was so they come with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany will take the lead role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that Germany is not easy, even from for-ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This theme has always been щекотливой. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans, it is clear that they need to play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as an international player is not will take it on themselves really a central role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or a leading role still difficult given Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not got used to this, it still has always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, is always difficult is to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany assume an important role, are the most various антигерманские feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Germans do not just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, it is an old problem: You do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this point of view, Germany is considerably more than the plight of the than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, the influence of the US in European politics is faltering, but at the moment the EU does not fills this vacuum, who then remains? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you do not like, unpleasant or reinforces нелюбовь to you - this is life!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabó, Deputy Director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, of the Institute, in which academics and experts-political scientists from Europe and North America jointly explore the problems of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, Szabo is a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic ties. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of trademarks&quot; in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is the internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is the Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> It is a completely officially registered in China ’ s name, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it was established. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However it will be protected until the owners of source names not with the suit. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But then it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners all the harder it becomes to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Паттлох, lawyer company Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights on trademarks in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desktop every week appears on a new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Add enough Имитаторам just a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada can be registered Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Паттлох opens the folder with records of the state registration of trademarks in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered in the trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, in which used the name fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> What the Chinese - champions of the world on copied and violation of intellectual property rights. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities have a multilevel department stores selling almost exclusively forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But Паттлоха. Such is not the case on behalf of their clients he opposes to Chinese company is officially received from the state registration marks the right to use the name, which already is where the then-still. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call this &quot;ban&quot; минпай, brand-passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> This word is associated with &quot;ban дакуань.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So called women who hunt for rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not accept the blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It damages the business, with this it is necessary to fight&quot;, is convinced Паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;Trade mark размывается, a unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs alone millions in the affected areas, especially in the case of expensive копируемых products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company by market research CLSA, China, with estimated sales of $15 billion euros a year is the third largest and most rapidly growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Паттлох tells about affairs, in which the court rejected claims, as after a long time опротестованное name has become &quot;реалией market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If NOT not lucky, he even will have to pay плагиатору, as did the damage his trade a in China, says Паттлох. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it is ruled by the Law of the Jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also famous for graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009 the company Daimler lost the legal dispute with producer of construction machinery SANY, enterprise, which not long before the company acquired-manufacturer Putzmeister Goker. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Volvo Купившая company line originally used Сине-white logo, напоминавший BMW; process was a success, the line had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Producer of fashionable goods Lacoste lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The registered trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010 from-for lack of personnel and equipment rooms there took place. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But in the past year the return of &quot;from an emergency situation in the working process to normalcy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So, the number of unprocessed affairs on objections has dropped by 22 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It was closed almost projects such cases, 75 percent more, than in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the Department. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To deal with this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year in CTMO received more than 1.4 million statements about the protection of trademarks, almost a third of the more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record, and means that China in the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations worldwide, according to authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, just 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, has been paid 1.8 billion yuan. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If to simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Its appeal is many times more, as the case of the German family enterprises of the plant. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group is struggling against the Chinese плагиатора. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans have managed to ensure that illegal manufacture them fake automobile parts elimination. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the simulator for a Chinese rights to the trademark plant. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was their own omission, as a surname in Germany are not subject to the protection, says hanno Вентцлер, Chairman of the Board of Chemical plant be in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the registration of trademarks CTMO отклонило claim мюнхенцев. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both instances the plant won, but other party continues to fight so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Need to be vigilant </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the question is being reviewed by the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Вентцлер hopes to bring it up to a good end and commends the professionalism of ships. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said: &quot;The process is extremely expensive, and we have a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Domestic spending is unlikely to be archive, accounting firms had to view even acts of a century ago to lead the evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, to no avail plant proposed a counterparty an &quot;greater шестизначную amount in the euro&quot; for settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;From here, it is clear how costly it is to us,&quot; says Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> And if imitation of зарегистрируют there for an unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register a name for a plant footwear and leather goods. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;Need to be vigilant,&quot; says Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As he and lawyer Паттлох recommend German companies be very cautious about China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international guidelines on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be &quot;all that what-either way is worth defending, to register also in China,&quot; says Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it may prove to be worth far more than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if the plant to lose in the last act of his drama about a sign, you will have to pay a counterparty an license fees for its own name, explains Вентцлер. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we will starve from the market in the unsettled segment. </seg>

<seg id="1790"> Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as you can see from the three research, published on Thursday in the journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> &quot;The Messenger&quot; found evidence that constantly located in the shadow of the planet is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Supposedly, the water comes with a comet or asteroid, freewheeling обещает. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific director of the probe Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature can reach Меркурии 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other construction elements of life in other places of the solar system. </seg>

<seg id="1834"> The researchers suggest that it was not long before the Big Bang, when the universe is basically like hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our views in the Universe: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Липперсгеем - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes became more and more - and included their cultural space deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, telescope &quot;cases&quot; in the Palomar knot under San-Diego was discovered by one of the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA, is the &quot;Binocular Telescope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> &quot;Gran Телескопио Канариас&quot; has a giant internal device is only one diameter mirror is 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The &quot;Big South African telescope&quot; in South Africa сегментировано - for the sake of the decline in value. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> However in diameter it reaches about eleven meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The lack of an inexpensive for: Telescope strictly under seal vertical angle - it restricts his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Telescope &quot;Хобби-Эберли&quot; in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His feature: The high светособирающая ability. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world ’ s largest telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of the radio in Arecibo, Puerto-Rico) researchers listening out of terrestrial signals in space. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Participating in the project &quot;Search внеземного mind&quot; (Seti), the owner of the computer can help by providing its computational power. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Views of the European обсерваторию astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes. </seg>

<seg id="1855"> In Chile ’ s major Observatory ESO also planned to install the European &quot;Very large telescope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1856"> His main mirror should раскинуться on as much as 42 meters - and will be drawn up of nearly 1,000 MNS elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, photos can be expected not before 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, both telescope &quot;Kek&quot; on the volcano гавайском Мауна Kea were considered to be the largest in the world. </seg>

<seg id="1868"> James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space not previously 2018 on board &quot;Ariane 5 rockets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: It must in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists suggest that on the south pole of the Mercury there is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> But reliable data about this, &quot;Messenger&quot; revolves closer to the Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the Меркурии there is ice. </seg>

<seg id="1891"> Legendary wealth, which the oil from the Caspian Sea, here, in a province until добралось. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Пилата Фатулаева (48) convinced that in Лерике than there is of interest to tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;In May, Baku has become famous for festival Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will be the oldest person in the world,&quot; says Фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is the director of the Museum of longevity is probably the only in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here задокументирована biography about eight dozen талышей from these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева indicates the black-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he is 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years he was born another child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But disputed the star of the museum is чабан Ширали Мюслюмов, which allegedly turned 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth certificates, however, is not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given that the architecture of the person, whose age confirmed documents, was 122 years, age Мюслюмова is extremely dubious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in the area as a result, who died in 1973,&quot; explains Фатулаева. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> A man has been married three times, and he was 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he allegedly was born the daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So whether чабан Мюслюмов added a couple of decades to its age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute for in Rostock, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;It is striking a lot of people of old age can be found in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the valley Хунза in Pakistan,&quot; said Scholz, &quot;in Sardinia also lives are a lot of very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> But from-for lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no civil registries. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day a glass of baked oil </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Лерика shockingly often reach biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now here are 20 people over 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here, in the south, so many centenarians? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani guide Farid Мугимзаде explains this special genes талышей. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Director of the Museum Фатулаева, on the other hand, believes that the food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talysh people like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them on выпивают стакану baked oil every day. But it is unlikely that such высококалорийная diet can be healthy with диетологической point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or the первобытном lifestyle that keeps people youth? In Ченгемиране, tiny village near the town of Lerik, Azerbaijan, lives Рубаба Мирзоева. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Мирзаева, which argues that it has 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the main problems of the region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with wishing oils, which tirelessly катает there-here. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here, under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Мирзаевой, which for a long time already there are their grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also nearby gallop two kids. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen guests prepare tea is served in the typical пузатых армуду glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The Мирзаевой perfectly aligned and strong white teeth, under the платком it hides a long dark-blond one, which her son proudly opens in front of us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always my hair milk, so that they never would not slip and saved the color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;And I never shampoo,&quot; says Мирзаева. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pensions for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always eaten only that has grown in the yard, tomatoes, potatoes, polka dots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For all the life I never bought products in the shop. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she tells about his return, served in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Heavier than there were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it was better, when &quot;favorite&quot; father Heydar Aliyev was at the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda is not frequently in the speeches of the old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no limits. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, then took over the reins of power to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Yet among Azerbaijani vassals there is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 (roughly the same the same amount of euros) Мирзаева receives a monthly as pensions, for local conditions of this amount, in which you live. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, for a long time the similarity of the son of Мирзаевой too right: &quot;Old men in our culture are deep respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, famous, surrounded by care and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> What is not the reason to stay alive as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is absent in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Revolution returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo suggest deep расколе country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution based support for Shari&apos;ah, met furious repulse. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Egyptian President not скупился on pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And its success is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech is turned to all people, but first and foremost to the Christian коптам, liberals, of enlightened Muslims and has been practiced for non-religious Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> For all of them, still hopelessly group in растерянной opposition, have fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of powerful &quot;Brothers-Muslims.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Morsi, if not rather, has said that he is both the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what really wants to save the 61-summer engineer with the degree of Doctor of the American University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Whether deprived of the power of the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, 234 articles managed to протащить 15 in the night-time jump steeplechase on исламистски настроенном constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and this is partly raises fears. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous truest in the project, said that the procedure is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that means &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use blurred formulation and in connection with her legal люфт for more strict interpretations of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At the very least, this one hints нововведенная article: In all matters concerning the Sharia, it is necessary to attract for University of Al-Achard, an Islamist institution in the country, a great authority in Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It should not, but it can mean that clergy regulates the laws that de-facto would be the consequence of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problem: Should survive jurisdiction civilians military trial. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts in the period of power Mubarak served to suppress opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the ouster of dictator in military detention will be to civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as explained in the project, the state must safeguard &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;to maintain its morals and values.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally it is set forth as нечетко that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Text is not that other, as censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In general, nor one article does not install right equality for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the prophet Muhammad and his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what is insulting and how it is punishable by, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Questionable also seems formulation that prohibited &quot;insulting people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Will be enough cartoons of the President or jokes about правоведа? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Morsi has a signature and which, he says, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to Egyptians to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;Revolution&quot; is back </seg>
<seg id="1971"> For several weeks is the opposition against the superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people have gathered in the unusual consensus on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to eradicate this document before he will be able to enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution has returned, and we will be victorious,&quot; said Хамдин Саббахи, the player that won third place in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Mohammed El-Барадеи said that the draft constitution place &quot;to dump history.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2059"> I am going to offer a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> To such statements next to the US president ’ s political career, on-Peña Nieto has developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national identity - the American Mexican origin. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to flee from the Mexico-for lack of opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the country about the difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Наваретте believes that Mexicans American origin caught between the two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, I passed along a corridor for arriving, came close to the border control and has stalled on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two: One for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I have a few seconds stood in front of them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my life called мексиканцем. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is simply a code name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves ирландцами, and friends from New-York consider themselves the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped on a complex structure &quot;American Mexican origin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here, in the land of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I say on-Spanish well enough to ask questions or to respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary poorer than the native speakers, and I can not get rid of the US emphasis. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I took out my American passport and was in turn for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexico ’ s newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were habitual for meetings with the presidents of these countries questions: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> President Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, rather than перебираться in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign an agreement on cooperation with the US and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals didn ’ t. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico relations with the United States is heavy and made of old grievances. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never thought about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under дулом rifles forced its leaders to abandon the half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But the Mexicans to the great for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders about those events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> That is why it is worth only what-or the problems in the US обмолвиться though word criticism toward Mexico, in the media and among the elite of the Mexican society, there are complaints about what Americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And descendants montezumae преисполняются воинственностью. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> At the same time the most complex is Mexico ’ s relationship with more than 35 million Americans of the Mexican origin living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> If you want to talk about обидах? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Their enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for themselves, and those for whom such opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los-Angeles-, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio-so many people of the Mexican origin for one reason: To what-the moment of their family history who-or - father and grandfather - did not have the opportunity to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Most of these were Mexicans a certain type of - blacky, малообразованные, from poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We their descendants, and we remember about it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today, our life is the epitome of the American dream, we were in good schools and for good work, but we do not forget that even this dream - American, not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national identity запутано and it is unclear, but we know what the country considered to be his. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Besides, we know that most of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class, we do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We guarantee them the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see in us reminder of degrading lesions and refer to us as a people of the second grade, as ненастоящим Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We are not good, and Spanish-speaking on our ties with Mexico not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence for them because of the failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We do not would be now for silk curtain, found in the US сытую life, but having lost spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States in childhood, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of the Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans increases understand their national identity, and Americans of the Mexican origin is unfair. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> It is a national of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my friends, the Americans of the Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Спрингстина. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you will lose the roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the US, we are called Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship without that not enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Americans to the Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and was represented by its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell their friends-Americans about which it is a beautiful country and how cool it to visit, and might be persuaded to political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Aha, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Nothing will be released. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many grievances in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, given the gap between rich and poor, binge of corruption and outlets, many of us does not believe that the country is really beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but with this разбирайтесь themselves, Амигос. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And this is true. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If the majority of Mexicans still can not to forgive the United States, as they were with Mexico one and a half century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans Mexican origin are still in Point for how recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes really. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle on a new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> An agreement on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundation for further world </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Is it possible to lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound, as usual, mindless debate about who first began; a lot of buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the neighbourhood of the capital of Israel Tel-Авива and holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном conflict in the Middle East came change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> This can be treated on-site, but the events of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; in закружили мятежной буре many established realities, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not managed to remain aloof from the whirlwind, потрясшего region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons that offer hope on the way out of this impasse death. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war without the winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the usual situation gives no cause for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreement, which was signed on 21 November, will be executed, occurred this week collision only strengthened security forces on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, come to power in Gaza in 2007, wide-spread from that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the losses they incurred. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In spite of the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is pursuing his popularity in the West Bank - another Palestinian territory controlled by now more moderate Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working in their favor. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world in Hamas new influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which, when then-was the closest ally Israel among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Two, the victorious Hamas supporters claim about creating around Israel Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, a militarized group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels here-here is overthrown power Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the power of King threaten Hamas ’ s allies. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of power in the region in the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Morsi Мухаммеде bolstered influence movement Brothers-Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention support for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Brothers-Muslims, by contrast, are, in many respects a parallel with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice can ’ t even trumped Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, the advocates of &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel will come to different conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In a military sense, Hamas was crushed. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; justified its costs for its creation and successfully destroyed many of running Hamas rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least what-the time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the US remained true to their unchanging positions; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the latest round of violence by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity Israel, especially when the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by missiles, released from the territory of Gaza, Israel managed to minimize the problem of terrorists-death row, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank is a significant part of the HDI Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegitimacy of such action from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime-Minister of Netanyahu ’ s Likud Party, whose - as part of the preparation to the set on January 22 election - teamed up with even more aggressively because conservatives under the guidance of Авигдора Либермана, very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What makes sense to the Palestinians and to give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If to give their hands all authority on the territory of the West Bank, begin to whether they run from missiles toward Israel, as do their lips in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Better to keep them behind a wall and hard to suppress any attempts to lift the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps supporters of &quot;hard&quot; line to prevail, but their calculations can be disproved the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> With that Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be internal problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Part of the defense budget Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help governments Arab countries to strengthen its own economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatism Egyptian President, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on ceasefire, is a good sign, and may well mark the beginning of change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, not least, should take into account the long term consequences of his policies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As the democratic change in Arab countries, a holder of the Palestinians ’ right to self determination represents a time bomb that sooner or later explode in the Israeli Occupied Territories, like автобусу, взорванному in Tel-Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For violent operations, which are held every few years on the territory of Gaza to clamp down on Hamas, must pay the growing frustration of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need in the external forced </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Remains the only solution, to which call for relentlessly sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: Education two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Remains hope, not too powerful in the short term, is the hope that the ceasefire will enable other countries more effectively influence the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which it is past time to decide if the delivery of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, a position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the Jewish state, taken since 1967 with the exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make the effort to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, than the vote at the UN, the result of which can become virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Their role is to bring Israel at the negotiating table, should play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he never presented its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House in the still-demonstrates reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is tragically недальновидная position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States vitally interested in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia, entered into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of the infested diseases body parts are контрастно on tiresome green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice of Australian law about однотипной packaging of cigarettes and other tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same depressing a box-olive color pictures жуткими disease struck parts of the body and images of children, whose health has been decimated smoking their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the different images and writings, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between with buckets, introduced in order to this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the most severe in the world for packs of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government Australia says that the purpose of this measure is to keep the youth from smoking, depriving the harmful habit of fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis for such a decision about the results of research, показавших that people do not smoke started to 26 years in 99 cases from 100 never are developed. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is obvious that even in the very beginning of the children, who are trying to understand the meaning of tobacco companies with the help of the packaging,&quot; explains Health Minister Tanya Плиберсек, referring to the study of the territory that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of Princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes is not especially be on profit multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures have already seen, and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly acceptance of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that it would only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his project,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, a representative of the company British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For whom-that, on the contrary, new laws to business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that demand for портсигары and silicone cases, скрывающие unpleasant pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies, such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court in Australia, where tried to challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra ha, the company Zico has already implemented around six thousand products companies wholesale trade, and offers a new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us it is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of these measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population, which sent these measures. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After taking in Australia of a number of laws, illegal television advertising cigarettes and their support of sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers or cigarettes in plain sight, advertising tobacco products moved on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australian government banned local companies and web-sites to advertise in the network, but it can not limit in this foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you invest in tobacco distributor and you have remained only this small, do not confuse the idea to promote their products to the Internet, you may find the very can&quot; - explains Bechi Freeman, writing questions of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of ostensibly normal users on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether this is the case of an average citizen who is so loves Marlboro cigarettes, and four time and made video, or this is the advertising company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Australian branch of the company British American Tobacco argues that the industry is now more busy adaptation to new rules than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: These states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all of these countries ’ trade relations with Australia very minor. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO is expected by mid 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tani Плиберсек, the government found with other countries to make them similar laws about packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada, the first imposed the mandatory posting photos, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia is defiantly not obey innovations. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures of me not задевают. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply do not the attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Just выхватываешь cigarette and прячешь pack in his pocket,&quot; explains Victor El Hague why cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor of the mouth cavity on the box since. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me throw - this is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Йу, Head shop tobacco products King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same box task has been complicated by selection of goods on streets </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before I have on unloading a new party would leave hour, and now four hours,&quot; he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to take and to ban cigarette, then we would have told: What do OK, all Twente, close shop,&quot; he says, вскидывая hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connection is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> In the Republican Party, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of our aircraft because mechanical failures and it was replaced by other aircraft, which we are pending. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I have had enough time to thinking about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not be able to fool you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help or books, magazines, no iPhone, nor even shops Free Trade. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But in recent times more scientists and experts on children ’ s development are in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored isn ’ t so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This causes the brain to interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> As in the modern world we all are constantly before how first-screen, the advantages of boredom are passing us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> It may be we need to seek to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will come back to this. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Before I, like many, has seen that boredom is the invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> This is not so, argues Peter TUI, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary, author of the book &quot;a fascinating history of boredom (&quot; Boredom: A Lively History, argues Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, boredom boasts very ancient history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii discovered Latin inscription about boredom, dating from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> It remains an open question about how we understand away the tedium. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, адъюнкт-professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often изменялось. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having studied materials research on this topic and asking the question of the target group in 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boredom is when people want to &quot;, but may not be engaged in the fact that would bring them satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between скукой and apathy, he says, is that скучающий people is not doing so-what would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> When apathy wants to do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main in переживаемой boredom, he says, is a &quot;violation of attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time stretches slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> On each boredom may seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible connection between these wealth скучающие people see causes problems in the outer world and circumstances, and people undergoing depression, see problems in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that we bored when, in fact, we just hard on the then-focus. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study &quot;Незанятый mind: Definition of boredom from the point of view of the attention&quot;, published in the September issue of the journal outlines on titles Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to an exit poll carried out by a previous experiment, participants who listened to the recording voices читающего magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants have heard a loud sounds not related to the case of TV programs, included in the next room, others have heard the same sounds on low volume, so their barely could disassemble, and a third group listened only record voice without external sound track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, other - it was difficult to focus, but they did not know the cause of this and is accused of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus attention on difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause away the tedium, says Marc J. Фенске, адъюнкт-professor of neurology at the University of Гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do that or-неинтересное, &quot;for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on the line in search of a marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is considered, he goes on, is that when people start покачиваться up on a stool or paint каракули on a piece of paper, they do it from the boredom, but we now know that actually doing so just help not relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The study found that children who do not prohibit ерзать and go round, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require sit kept&quot;, says Professor Фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> In what then-moments we are all feeling away the tedium: In the event of a delay in flight (as in my case), listening to the dull, неинтересный film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But different people have different levels of propensity for boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980-x ’ s to measure such individual peculiarities of researchers have developed a special &quot;scale propensity for boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and assertions, for example, &quot;Much of what I have to do, and однообразно монотонно&quot; or &quot;me too much interesting, so it does not have the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of these questionnaires, researchers have determined that the boys скучают most girls, says Stephen Воданович, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular with a variety of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But as a whole at teenagers often скучают. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he linked by using the pager from almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32% of teenagers announced that they bored in school and during the execution of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> While only 3% of parents noted that they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that it has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that the &quot;age of adolescent is the propensity for boredom,&quot; largely because children and teenagers do not allow to fully address than they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my original question: Boredom is useful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations it, according to the studies, can nudge people to absurd and dangerous individual actions, risky Gaming or abusing certain substances in efforts to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between скукой and creativity, says Professor Воданович, who has spent studying the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brains tells us that should be in the then-other; this is boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New-York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> This, however, the brain is not always knows, than it is better to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you will be boring and you send our way this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you can make themselves better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you ’ re watching TV, you will be better only on what-the time, and soon it will take place. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So, if your child hunter and you give it to the iPad, it ceases to be entertained, but he did not learn to deal with скукой alone or as-or any other way to manage their time and employment, says Professor Фенске. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;But such skills independent regulation used in various situations,&quot; he argues. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only on their own to occupy themselves than-then, he is also studying self-control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think I should be as then-praised by. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But its than-something bad is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agree with it. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see it is that we need more often I, with boredom is extremely worryingly, the unquenchable desire to tackle the then-conscious,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to like then-to disconnect from our concerns and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world, we have grown used to the constant excessive stimulating the senses, ” he says, and when the silence, we теряемся and do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> So far, it is not clear how it will be a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, девятнадцатилетний player soccer team and a student of public college for-eastern state of Colorado accused of committing a felony, consisting in what will soon be absolutely legally on the whole territory of the state: Possession of small amounts of marijuana and tubes, in which he its smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> G-n Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Ламаре and drove in the car to slowly near the border with Канзасом when they had been stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found in the car, cannabis-well Orozco came agenda in court for drug possession and possession of device for the use of drugs, for each of which причитается a fine of $100 - and the appointed date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;With us are treated as criminals,&quot; says g-n Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But the offender? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that has been underway for several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small trials depends not so much from the law, how many from consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Charges of petty offences related to affects, already are removed in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which took a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already ceased to charges to be withdrawn people at the age of 21 and older for storage of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine existing with affects, and still attract accountable for storage of this drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West ’ s vote to prevent the emergence of their new places, licensed to shops on the sale of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All of this is so rapidly that I do not even know what to expect further,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east from Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington, too, озадачено почесывают head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are to form the rules to determine the order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this should be done until December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in the resolution of the issues, the first use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado more than an orderly market, so they will serve as a good example of the&quot; - explains Bryan I. Smith, a representative of the Council for regulation of production and sales of alcohol in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But now no one can do more, recognizes the g-n Smith, than to what-the offers and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent that we could focus,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Bill in Washington, called I-502, will take effect on December 6, and the whole year ввергнет staff in the state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is not yet, and the right of ownership affects already узаконено. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are in fact still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find the balance between the state about &quot;adequate access to&quot; complete with марихуане ban on trade it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It is especially difficult will be licensed to trade affects within cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group &quot;Center for legalization of marijuana.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21, the police chief of Oates from Aurora sent out his underling email message that the Prosecutor General ’ s Office of the city will no longer attract people under the age of 21, accountable for possession of a small quantity of marijuana, and that the police stop уличать people in these violations &quot;from this moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief of Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal vendors and distributors of drug use. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The prosecutor of Weld in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the draft law, he said, the prosecutor ’ s office will be on-still attract accountable for possession of affects mainly to encourage the use of its people to pass the course of treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment, 119 parties charged in possession of two and less ounces of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The duty of our institutions - for actions that are considered criminal at the time you make them,&quot; said g-n Back in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reaction was ambiguous, even in places like rural District Mesa, where the vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police Grand Джанкшн, the biggest city in the district, no longer attracts to justice services for possession of a small number of drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney General Pete Хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided not to charge on already open cases related to storage of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until he will not change is our primary responsibility,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of residents of Colorado, took part in the vote, supported this decision, including the use of marijuana in the state and the legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the confused reaction in different parts of the state ’ s ambiguity relations local authorities to experiment in the state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;The county prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier&quot; - explains Shawn MacAlister, денверский lawyer representing the interests of the condemned for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of марихуане. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They harassed people for so long is that now can not by-now accept that this is not a crime,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small quantity of marijuana are the same as for alcohol is destined to become the experimental field in the scope of the country to test the idea of drug legalization. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Proponents of legalization and officials plan to expand the state legalized trade, but at the same time they cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which still-plan to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Proponents of legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice lose on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several received a resonance arrests traders and patients, papers marijuana for medical indications, the federal government in most cases provided welcome on trade affects for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Bureau to fight drugs are unlikely to be fixes in home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become a blind eye to regulatory authorities in the shops of the recreational marijuana, which are permitted under the new law, believes Kevin A. Сабет, a former advisor to combat drug trafficking in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of the new shops selling marijuana, and so could not open up earlier than a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, has put forward for consideration six-month ban on trade affects, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in this position, that we supply you with whom the-license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now we have the apparent contradiction between the results of the local vote and voted for what state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There remains a lot of issues outstanding. </seg>

<seg id="2595"> &quot;People need to Singapore to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I husband patriot, you my wife патриотка, our civic duty and will create life!!!!!!! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem inconceivable that these lines are part of the advertising limes pastilles, but despite this - or perhaps because of this - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of the raps, which uses local saying such as &quot;put her бао (булку) in an oven&quot; to laugh over birth rates, in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Advertising agency, which has made this video, the activity, enshrines the laudable hope that with the help of advertising they will draw attention to this issue in the form of entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to people have a &quot;national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world as a member of a similar, so we felt that it is the theme that we must affect. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government attempted to do much, for example to launch spirits with феромонами or organize parties fast (dating a blitz-dates). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas, may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why we don ’ t make the most креативную thing from possible to solve this problem, namely to make the rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 child </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not perceive it so frivolously, it is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1.300 US dollars a year on policy to floating citizens on the birth of more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The package for couples and parents provides up to 15.000 dollars for a child, prolongs holiday parental and provides tax breaks. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all of this has low effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich and high tech state-city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national governance by population, is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time he was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976. </seg>

<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding, and the creation of the family,&quot;, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes social norms contribute to a rise in the number of холостяков and postponement of marriage and children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which seeks to a sharp increase in immigration to confront a reduction in population, causes resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there is a web-sites, where flourishes barely скрываемая xenophobia against many of new immigrants, especially Chinese, which criticized for maintaining wages low and unwillingness to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The growth of immigration also is seen as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the decline in fertility is known for economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, an example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> Government efforts to not so much has been building a housing. </seg>

<seg id="2629"> Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote холостому lifestyle and incentive for developers who want to build a large family. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu sun, the CEO of the company домостроительной EL Developers, says that their &quot;shoe boxes&quot; sold much faster than the more spacious copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments раскупаются for a few days, weeks, even faster than the larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear benchmarks for developers, who had put obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too перенапряженные </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore, a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules can be a step in the direction of increasing national birth rates, after a conversation with сингапурцами who work in the financial district centre, it seems that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very перенапряжены, housing, expensive, as well as education, and from-for this many people this delay,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But it is important for me to place their own money and time,&quot; says another young man 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mention his career, stress and housing prices and education as a reason that make it difficult for them to get children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, how would the government nor the leadership has tried to induce citizens to a birth of children, in terms of деторождения, a final word for сингапурцами. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Personal offline - personal online </seg>

<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know that this кибермоббинг&quot;, - confirms it. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Марьелос Porras, преподавательница English and an expert on education and training, believes that, in order to children and teenagers, you need to understand that the purpose of the social networks - to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as the tool for searching information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras indicates that the mark Пренски, master of pedagogy at Yale University, and author of labor Digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives, it is they, children and young people who were born in an era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we learn for themselves,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that this theme complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a certain criteria what can or cannot be to distribute, publish or to speak at the age of maturity, when not enough for this.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2688"> According to a specialist, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and teenagers, is to ask questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Talk to them, so that they did not do this, futile&quot;, she added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Porras lists some of the options: There are things that you do not told незнакомцу, so why would you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, you would have liked, if published a photo of you like the one that you published about his friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know that other publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you подписываешь photos with parties, просишь whether you permission from other people to celebrate them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another, all I need to know that you do in every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online as well, as do it offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules are the same. </seg>

<seg id="2784"> The young man concealed it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> To cope with the disease, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible, and his efforts frustrated - he has already said a 43-long birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrizio is one of the oldest &quot;patients&quot; HIV-branch of the hospital, Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he appeared in 1994, breaking many obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with the diagnosis &quot;by&quot; (HIV) for 22 years. In the beginning of 90-х in it would be difficult to believe, then there was too little treatment options, too little known about the disease, too jaundiced treated patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even so, the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security is not wanted to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he was порез.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those days have AIDS was an independent and impartial. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive in this синдроме and do it, not the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Nevertheless, not knowing about their illness, so far, many people come, when the virus already crippled, &quot;drew down&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> After 31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, &quot;a great achievement at this time is that the survival of the patient, who begins to treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same&quot;, - pointed out, the head of the HIV-of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information has been confirmed by in April of this year, in the prestigious scientific edition. </seg>

<seg id="2794"> Simply put, this means that the one who gets diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, &quot;supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess the progress, it is necessary to remember that life expectancy Mexicans today at an average annual rate of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report from UNAIDS), it is also true that from the moment of occurrence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>

<seg id="2798"> - Why until now there are a lethal outcomes? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - Personally I think that the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I have it, as is the case in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the past 12 years we have had no shortage of медикаментах, the problem is that patients come too late, because they do not know about his инфицированном state, that is, in the late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He brought Anatoly data: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when already have what first-оппортунистическую infection; what you need to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect in mass scale, for all the people that this will be asked to&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its offer opined experts and officials of the State Council for prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients, such as Fabrizio, which turned to check in private laboratory побужденный only by the fact that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой Капоши, realized by the tumor, which is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you had AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that will die, and don ’ t want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Once all the same to die, I am надираться three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I well питаюсь, do exercises, accept the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today, his parents only know that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, as any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel,) an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, our about yourself and about another man&quot;, - listed Fabrizio, which agreed to share their personal lives with MILENIO JALISCO to сподвигнуть its statement of those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, is fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let проверятся, if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible will learn whether they are HIV-positive, better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let him know that they can live as any other person, being responsible. </seg>

<seg id="2887"> By that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements Минси in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we have received the fourth place and it should be, if not the Canadian judge, which has forced us to play the final game, Reyes said. </seg>

<seg id="2906"> Participation in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the beginning of 90-х in BSN was to 17 teams of the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you need to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to make, for example, regionalization of the smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national плей-off. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the guys travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At the very least, I see the fruits of obligatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> This gives me. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> Now what do you do? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my times on YouTube, &apos;m enjoying their grandchildren and occasionally go into the basketball games. </seg>
