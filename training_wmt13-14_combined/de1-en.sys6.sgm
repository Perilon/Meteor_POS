<seg id="100"> The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work. </seg>
<seg id="101"> For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw with, how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals, which did not have the means to help him. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident nearby in Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon, in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="103"> First, he had only a broken arm, but then formed an infection that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma, which should affect him for the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="104"> &quot;There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon&quot;, so Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="105"> We had brought him out of Cameroon, if we had had the money. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Instead, Bwelle spent years helping his father in crowded clinics and hospitals there to get treatment, which had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="107"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; commented Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="108"> You can leave the House at five o&apos;clock in the morning and run to the hospital, to be the first, and is not yet first. </seg>
<seg id="109"> There are very many patients. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Some people even die because they need to wait. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In Cameroon, there is only a doctor for the 5,000 people, as the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="113"> In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But even if there were a doctor for them, the most Cameroonians couldn&apos;t afford the visit. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private. </seg>
<seg id="116"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="118"> His father and so many of his countrymen had to see suffer in Bwelle mature decided to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free operations in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="120"> He was even a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="121"> He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and provides free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Almost every Friday squeeze he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the artistic medical equipment on the roof over very rough terrain in the villages that need help. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Not always, everything runs smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="125"> More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="126"> But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In these villages, free healthcare is truly a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - is happy with his broad smile and his boundless energy - at the cheerful ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="128"> The next morning, the team then begins with the study of hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="129"> &quot;We treat Pro Ride 500 people&quot;, so Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="130"> They come from a radius of 60 km to the village - walk. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Each of these Wochenendkliniken offers medical care in a number of areas. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Others are given crutches, donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school, but simply cannot afford many poor families. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="135"> The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or apartment; after surgery, the patients get up and go in the recreation area to make room for the next. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the Group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work in the early hours of the morning on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It is a tough stint, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated. </seg>
<seg id="138"> &quot;You drums all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday the team rides back in the city, tired, but proud on the work they have done. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has 700 free operations last year conducted and white, she cause an enormous difference for the people with their work, which helps. </seg>
<seg id="141"> A man explained that the free operation of a bar break, he had received, now enable him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="142"> &quot;That changed the future of my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="143"> In addition to the Wochenendkliniken and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="144"> With this second job, he will finance 60% of his charitable activity, as Bwelle; the rest came from private donations. </seg>
<seg id="145"> &quot;I don&apos;t know really, when he is asleep&quot;, says Katie o&apos; Malley, a sophomore at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group works with. </seg>
<seg id="146"> He is always either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the Organization, so that he can go on these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medical and nursing students, such as O&apos;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would get at home never. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;We at operations it might, where we help blot blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle&quot;, O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That would be never possible in America as a medical student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students usually pay their travel to Cameroon and bring frequently donated medical material. </seg>
<seg id="151"> But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guide. </seg>
<seg id="152"> &quot;He is a hero without a doubt,&quot; says O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no bounds. </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle, the almost constant work is no burden. </seg>
<seg id="155"> To help others to a happier life, and to fulfill a promise he gave his father, gives him great pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="156"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy if I do this work,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope he sees what I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain. </seg>

<seg id="161"> Pope Franziskus appoints first Cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="162"> Pope Franziskus will appointed first new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Cardinals are the highest ranking cleric in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also choosing a Pope, so that Francis will nominate the first group of men thus, which ultimately will contribute to the election of his successor. </seg>
<seg id="164"> There are currently 201 Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="165"> But a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, can no longer take part in the election of the Pope – that falls to a group of 120 &quot;voting Cardinals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="166"> In a statement, in which the message was posted, said father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, there will take place a meeting of all Cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of new cardinals will held, who was known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="167"> &quot;Pope Franziskus has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the consistory for other meetings, which require the participation of Cardinals from around the world, can be scheduled in advance in February&quot;, Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jack Valero Catholic voices said that the number of voting Cardinals will probably be dropped until February. </seg>
<seg id="169"> He said a Pope nominates as necessary, so that the number of voting Cardinals again amounts to 120, and want as many Cardinals over 80, as he usually so many Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The consistory in the next year was so important, because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Currently, there is some overhang on the side of Europe and especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from around the world, to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Forty percent of Catholics living in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The Cardinals will be also the first to be appointed since the creation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world, which have the mandate to find ways to reform the Church. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In the past, the Pope decided everything alone. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Now Francis has selected these eight Cardinals to help him&quot;, said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis ask the Cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="178"> But so far, we weren&apos;t in this situation - this is all very new. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Valero said that typically the bishops from large locations would be appointed Cardinals, but put Francis &apos;full of surprises - so we know not whom he appoints&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="186"> Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who provide wealth and work in the UK, want to change our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="187"> For this purpose, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders in order and asked them what they think about the United Kingdom, the economy and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="188"> YouGov questioned over 1,000 leaders from business, roughly forming the British company sizes, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Many will be surprised by the results of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="190"> We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernize and grow, while the States in the EU remain stagnant. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You want that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored Government, instead of the long and tiring process to reside, to reform the obscure institutions. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Asked according to certain legally regulated topics - by the antitrust to product legislation - is the majority of the business leaders of the view, the control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="193"> There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, since according to the company the cost of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits, being part of Europe&apos;s trade zone - voted even 40 percent of large companies, which are traditionally most Europe-friendly. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Finally, and probably say most, resulted in our survey of business leaders, that a clear majority hankers after a course in the direction of change of the agreement of the United Kingdom and a relationship with the EU that is not based on trade policy. </seg>
<seg id="195"> This knowledge, which can be found at companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is on a &quot;meaningful change&quot; is pushing, which brings the issue of action back to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="196"> There is a revision of the agreement much - and better conditions for United Kingdom 16 percent would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="198"> It also shows the company by a renegotiation back expect a significant shift in the balance of power to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the euro zone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal Union. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Jobs and growth in the UK must be the priority, as shown in the result of our survey, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the approach to regulations for companies. </seg>

<seg id="583"> Tripodi, who was Minister of port from February 2006 through November 2009, had originally advocated public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="584"> But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as confirmed by Sam, had been pressing a refactoring of the Government lease arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="585"> A phone transcript presented the ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior civil servant, which was changed in the harbour Department, after he had worked under Obeid at the Fisheries Agency. </seg>

<seg id="590"> NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia about government monitoring </seg>
<seg id="591"> On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="592"> On instruction of the Federal Office for constitutional protection and counter-terrorism (BVT), the German internal secret service, he should shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="593"> According to German media, the bat was going to prove the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="594"> James Clapper, American Director of national intelligence, was in September, again making sure that the United States used no possibilities of foreign espionage, &quot;in order to steal the secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="595"> But since Edward Snowden, the former employees become the whistleblower, has begun with the publication of his cornucopia of American surveillance secrets, European Governments and corporate executives are not sure whether they can take the Director at his word. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Reports that the American National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company of Petrobras and procured are data of American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the corporate paranoia because of Government monitoring to a new high. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The last straw for iterating over the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone was bugged, possibly already for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="598"> If the most powerful person can get into Europe in the visor, then also managements are potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Snowden has made transparent to the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I think it is conceivable that these data be used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="602"> German companies believe the United States now presented a risk almost as large as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, so a survey released in July by the consulting firm of EY. </seg>
<seg id="603"> The documents leaked by Snowden there but so far no evidence that the United States gave the secrets of foreign companies to their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Politicians have their concern expressed about, that the EU lacked specific IT - and Internet opportunities and she should reduce their dependence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The companies are skeptical in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="606"> In the Bundestag, it was suggested we should build a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I can close my eyes and slowly open it... </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;It doesn&apos;t work&quot;, says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP. </seg>
<seg id="609"> If you wanted a strong European IT industry, then you should let them become extinct 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal cars up to agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Everything on the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="612"> However, have coverage and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations shocked companies, who had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Cloud computing, a major change will take place because European business leaders are now conscious that in the United States stored data of the case-law are subject to and are therefore potentially at risk. </seg>
<seg id="614"> According to one of the cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, survey conducted about ten per cent of the members resident in the United States not rejected after the revelations about the U.S. data-mining activities with Prism plans to use an American provider. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: &quot;we see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago--she is: where my data is stored and can ensure that they remain physically in this area of Justice?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="616"> Many German business executives argued that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew, namely that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and this therefore be guarded at all costs must. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is no surprise that economic espionage takes place. </seg>
<seg id="618"> It was always thus. </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, Chairman of chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Americans spying on us commercial and industrial level, so how we do that also, because it is in the national interest to defend our company. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Corporate governance not normally brags about the countermeasures that it has taken, because that gives you benefits attackers. </seg>
<seg id="622"> In large companies has long been blued a staff that taking a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unsupervised leave of a laptop in the hotel room was not advisable, to say the least. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Ulrich Hackenberk, Board member at automaker Audi, says that it belonged for years to the standard practice, to collect the phones before a Board meeting, so that they can not be used as bugs. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The German bat advises managers to use simple prepaid cell phones, when they go abroad, because smartphones can be potentially compromised. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The prepaid cell phones are thrown away afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="626"> However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="627"> In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche. </seg>
<seg id="628"> &quot;The experience, the staff and financial resources small and medium-sized enterprises often lack, to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access&quot;, warns the bat in a report. </seg>
<seg id="629"> The United States own companies warn of economic espionage by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="630"> According to the Washington Post were in the U.S. National Intelligence estimate in the February of France, Russia and Israel behind China ranked two of the countries classified, which is used for the procurement of economic data of the hacking. </seg>

<seg id="648"> Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, which he takes. </seg>
<seg id="649"> So how it is started, it will not take long, until he is on the &quot;Horse of the year&quot;-Schau - and I&apos;m sure that he will do well. </seg>
<seg id="650"> A spokesman who said the annual Horse Show: &quot;Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should deal with his pony.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="706"> Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth will take &quot;immediate measures&quot; to avert a crisis, which was caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations. </seg>

<seg id="708"> The Government &quot;has put together an emergency rescue package, which is in our opinion the unique challenges of facing federal State&quot;, Plibersek said today. </seg>
<seg id="709"> The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million emergency aid for optional services. </seg>
<seg id="710"> More 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for cataracts, residues should be eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="711"> In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up after inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals. </seg>

<seg id="721"> &quot;We are therefore in the current situation, because the labor State Government has deducted $430 million from the health system&quot;, he told ABC TV. </seg>

<seg id="880"> The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline of net profits on Thursday, after he was advised by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract issues in the railway sector under pressure. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Bombardier headquartered in Montreal the CSeries released no flight test data for his brand new aircraft and issued no new information, whether the plane according to the ambitious timetable could go in next September in the commercial use. </seg>
<seg id="882"> So far only three more starts, was followed by the maiden flight of the test aircraft and a half months ago which seems questionable whether the test phase as planned runs. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="884"> On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst with national bank financial, lowered his rating from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;Sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters has a limited upside potential. </seg>
<seg id="885"> &quot;Although weaker aircraft delivery figures were expected as far as possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,&quot; Doerksen said in a customer letter. </seg>
<seg id="886"> We are of the opinion that Bombardier new orders for the CSeries is obtained if the test program to the aircraft progresses. </seg>
<seg id="887"> If however in the coming months no new orders will be announced, we expect that the market will face more skeptical the program. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower segment of the market that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="889"> The first test aircraft was introduced in March of public and flew for the first time in September after months of delays. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But so far binding orders for the CSeries, with 177 are moderate, because potential buyers would wait and see the results of flight tests, whether the claims of the company with respect to fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new Düsenverkehrsflugzeugs are true. </seg>
<seg id="891"> There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies. </seg>
<seg id="892"> President and CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier its target of 300 binding orders to the beginning of the commercial exploitation of the Jets will reach. </seg>
<seg id="893"> On Thursday compared with analysts and media, corporate governance also assured the program lay in the schedule. </seg>
<seg id="894"> &quot;The test aircraft has remained no longer on the ground than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said during a telephone conference, adding that during the lifetime of the aircraft ground tests and software updates have been applied. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Every manufacturer of plans otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="896"> We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, what we have done. </seg>
<seg id="897"> This is done during the entire flight program. </seg>
<seg id="898"> It was the second of five test aircraft will start probably the rest shortly thereafter, in the next few weeks, by the company. </seg>
<seg id="899"> However, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after its maiden flight of the first customer can take a plane of the CSeries in operation. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Bombardier said, check the planning for entry into service (EIS), and will update this in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="901"> &quot;The slow progress the flight test - even if they obviously comply with bombardiers of internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning the first quarter 2015 moves&quot;, Doerksen said. </seg>
<seg id="902"> In the third quarter ending September 30 fell Bombardier net profit of $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year. </seg>

<seg id="909"> &quot;In the aeronautical and space were the results in the context of our objectives, but low order intake and the market as a whole were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Sales in the aviation and Aerospace Division fell 13 percent to $2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest railway manufacturer, announced that the sales in this Division by almost 11 per cent rose to 2.1 billion dollars. </seg>

<seg id="927"> Qantas said it will remain until further notice in the current regulations. </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;Our current regulations stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during the launch and the landing, and we have no plans at this time to change that,&quot; the company said. </seg>

<seg id="930"> We are the FAA decision however always to developments in regulations interested passengers can benefit from, and be as well as the reasons behind it certainly look. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The decision affects different U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet. </seg>
<seg id="932"> You must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the interference by mobile devices, and you can change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer training. </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;Once an airline has confirmed its fleet the tolerance, she can allow using portable, lighter electronic devices such as Smartphones, tablets and E-book readers at any height passengers&quot;, the FAA announced. </seg>
<seg id="934"> In rare cases when visibility is poor, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during the landing. </seg>

<seg id="975"> The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title &quot;Songs to the celebration of the Holy sacrifice of the fair&quot;, D 872, is a spiritual music work of the composer Franz Schubert built in 1826 and was considered at the time of the emergence of almost revolutionary. </seg>
<seg id="976"> The fair is listed in the framework of the services, as the principal of Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir of the woodwind group of the Musikverein is Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi accompanied on the organ. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Scientists could shed more light on how that relates a dog with its tail wagging. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail more waving to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was the left nervous dogs. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But now scientists say that other dogs may perceive these subtle differences and respond to it. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist who University of Trento, said: &quot;in humans is well known, that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli, which cause positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here we have tried in other species to look at this. </seg>
<seg id="983"> He also remarked that the right half of the brain for the movement of the left was responsible for dogs just like humans and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles with the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> To learn more about how dogs react on the lateral tail wagging their kind, the researchers monitored the animals while himself saw these films of other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="985"> They measured the heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Probably we will soon understand why the tail times even moving in the, in the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we showed movies with dogs the dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we could control more movement of the tail to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="988"> When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog has moved the tail to the right (as viewed from the perspective of the flying dog out) they were totally relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="989"> But the inclination of the tail was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog which wags), so your heart rate increased and she looked uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="990"> According to Professor Vallortigara dogs not intentionally communicate by these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> He believes, instead, that the dogs from experience had learned what movement they should worry and when not. </seg>
<seg id="992"> He said: &quot;When you have various encounters with other dogs and the wagging tail in one direction is rather associated with friendly behavior and the right hand side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal. </seg>
<seg id="994"> John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine of the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study investigated whether left and right for dogs is important. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn upside left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it&apos;s a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Of other research at the University of Victoria in Canada was the following: &quot;rather go to dogs on a robotic dog, if, cock &apos; left WAGs and not right, instead restless - exactly the other way around as in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to his words the differences could derive from the fact that the dogs in the different studies not interpreted by the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study, how dogs respond to real dogs that could help, he said. </seg>
<seg id="999"> &quot;While there is considerable evidence of many different mammals, that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes, but many of the details must yet be determined - and dogs are no exception,&quot; as Bradshaw. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Because her behavior but simply record, it will probably not long until we understand why the tail sometimes sometimes moves in the one in the other direction. </seg>

<seg id="1081"> So happy Ralf Rangnick red with the current top form by Bundesliga front-runners Bull is Salzburg, as the Sports Director of the &quot;bulls&quot; of the referees was disappointed. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;There is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and Alan are squeezed into the category of swallow Kings&quot;, he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Recent Rangnick criticism was yellow for Mane in a 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which an alleged acting doomed the Senegalese - which of course was not, as the TV pictures showed. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> &quot;A blatant mistake&quot;, said Rangnick, who described referee Haidery as &quot;completely overwhelmed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Haidery would also have &quot;its part&quot; to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game contributed. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> He defended his German compatriot decidedly: &quot;Because I would have behaved right in every single situation like Roger Schmidt&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Schmidt himself will have no contact after the skirmish with Halladay with his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> I don&apos;t why. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> &quot;Because I&apos;m the one who was offended,&quot; the age said. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> Given the run of success, Rangnick, but agreed a hymn of praise. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> &quot;There are only two words: really good&quot;, he noted. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> There is not much to criticize. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> Especially the way in which the team plays, is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> This should go on quietly. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> In the winter transfer period, there would hardly be squad changes. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> There is no great reason to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> &quot;Unless someone comes up with the desire, that he wants to leave the Club&quot;, clarified Rangnick. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> The British Government announced a study that will enhance the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> In the work of HS2 Ltd proposes achieving already at the beginning of phase 1 in the year 2026 high speed links between Scotland and the North of England. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project &quot;will bring together United Kingdom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> On completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high speed road between London and the North of England by 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd, to search for more track capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> This includes the possibility of a travel time of eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, bringing together Britain and its cities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1108"> We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous advantages. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Without it, we face a capacity crunch in our railway network. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> But it&apos;s also about the connection between 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Keith Brown Carmichael urged on behalf of the Scottish Government, &quot;unequivocally&quot; the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network to engage in. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> Brown said: &quot;the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, at the same time, but also the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Therefore, we are pleased, as a partner of the British Government to work and exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland which creates benefits for all and complemented the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> I am looking forward, with the British Ministers next year to review the investigation report and to decide the next steps together. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Living with prospects for the future </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Actually, Waltraud lives fantastically Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an old stock of trees, nice neighbors, and not too much traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid I hope before spinning?&quot;, asks Waltraud Ries and shows on a fat Spider to the door frame. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> I&apos;m looking for a new apartment for some time for my husband and me. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The reason is however no spiders phobia, but the concern, no longer being able to cope with the many stairs to the House and in the home, at the age she explains. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Also: Since a meniscus operation the Mittfünfzigerin on my own body has need to know what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> First recently published a book of hers titled &apos;happily reside in the age - which perception is the best for me?&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> &apos;Our apartment is the best example of what doesn&apos;t at the age&apos;, she begins to tell. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> When she moved with her husband in the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the Greens. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Today with mid-fifties, Waltraud thinks differently about Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> She also knows that she belongs to the few people, dealing with the topic &apos;Housing for the elderly&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Most ignore it, as long as it goes. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Only the others are old &apos;, she says with a grin. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Only when the suffering is really great, you do are thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &apos;Then it may be already too late&apos;, so Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In her book, the Interior presents 17 residential models for a self-determined housing for the elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> &apos;What living form but select, is always an individual decision&apos;, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> D i e solution there is not for the ages. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Even those who could afford the retirement residence in Tuscany or Brittany, should consider getting, he could be sick, too. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> And: &apos;Without good knowledge of the local language is large in the Dolce Vita,&apos; admits the book author willing to deportation. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing or the oft-cited retired WG. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Everyone has so his ticks and quirks in the age </seg>
<seg id="1141"> &apos;For me nothing would be so a shared apartment but&apos;, she says with a wink. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Nowhere near enough like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> &apos;At the age you need simply his retreat&apos;, so Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> A senior living community can still work, the author wants to exclude yet. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> That should run but otherwise as in the classic student WG. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> And sometimes you want to also just his rest &apos;, she believes. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> With this opinion it is not alone at least in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> &apos; The most ancient people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it can in its own home&apos;, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Their services advises people around the theme &apos;get older&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Therefore would take just older people often also inconveniences and limitations in buying, only to stay in their familiar environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> There many ways to make the House or the apartment barrier-free. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> RIES recommends all dealing with the age-based remodeling of her house or her apartment, to inform themselves thoroughly and to entrust not the first craftsmen. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Today, there are specialists for the age-based conversion. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Even in the apartment, one could be others realize and enlighten if there is only the raised toilet seat, the Interior Designer. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But not always, the existing housing can be age and therefore barrier-free remodeling, even if she is still so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> This experience had to make Waltraud Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> While you could install a stair lift inside the home, the way paved with stairs would be the far greater obstacle to the apartment door but. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> She will keep searching until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Before the move, it shades her more than before the spider on her apartment door. </seg>

<seg id="1186"> Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light </seg>
<seg id="1188"> He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court </seg>
<seg id="1189"> A well-known criminal defense lawyer, who warned a large police investigation, because he was afraid, a drug Baron his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, was sentenced to three years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about the investigation to its activities in the drug trade, after he was been compromised by his own addiction to cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The lawyer praised by criminologists as &quot;top notch&quot; nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; was arrested 2011 at his home after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in previous proceedings of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Civil servants observed how Scarborough (32) cocaine at the home of lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered three bag, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information about the arrest of two men in behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> All four suspects were then monitored by the police during a major investigation to the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police at a series of house searches, heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £ 200,000 of cash made sure. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction could be made public. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm of Forbes solicitors in Blackburn, was found in two charges obstruction of Justice guilty at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial and sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> He admitted to possession of cocaine in a previous survey. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> The lawyer was convicted after police found in their investigations against Scarborough, that it had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went home to Bosbos and there put the drugs with a purity of 60 per cent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of advocate. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Shortly after he drugs had delivered, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications between the two were exchanged. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In court, it was announced that Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after drugs of class A in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards were discovered in tests. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer because this was his client, and claimed that the &quot;attorney-client&quot;privilege is subject to their discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Ditta took his wallet during his arrest and was trying to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> During the police interrogation, he stated he run an Office with his home address as well as in the workplace and clients would call home it due to legal matters. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> In court it became known that he had telephoned key players of against drug trafficking, which he had represented some previously, after significant arrests and informed, what did the investigators about them. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;A criminal lawyer should better than everyone else know that you are not breaking the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer because he has admitted too much with specific clients. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The relationship in question is not a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied drugs to his lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Part of his message was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of this people. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> He worked against the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Thus, Mr. Ditta brought his profession into disrepute. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> He was close to certain clients, in particular, Scarborough, and he has allowed that his independence was compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing by himself and claimed: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, I&apos;m not, and wanted to provide information to Scarborough, then I would wait no 15 hours, but do that right away.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1218"> But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead, of Lancashire police said: &quot;Mr Ditta made the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment, as he began to purchase drugs by organized criminals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1219"> His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public trust and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> Ditta has betrayed this trust and tries to hide behind the facade of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> The serious and organised crime unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and obstruction of Justice, what underlines our determination to bring criminals to court. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> We find and bring to justice. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after he had declared the plot to the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Participating ´ another thirty-five people on drug trafficking were sentenced to Gesamtstrafen 153 years for drug offences. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job is to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality was the motivation for his work on his website. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Up to the present time, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children, which threw them against House facades. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Because the homeowner realized this in time and right away the remnants of the egg, also no damage may have arisen. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Also probably some new year&apos;s Eve firecrackers were lit throughout the city, but again no damage has arisen. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> A local resident in the Bishop Fatin way reported that were wrapped his car with toilet paper and its ornamental Hubcaps stolen. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Until the arrival of the police the man has his wheel covers found however all again in close proximity, so the police had to be not working. </seg>

<seg id="1245"> Council takes trackage in the visor </seg>
<seg id="1246"> To the level crossing &quot;the deer&quot; converted elaborately, to increase road safety? </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Yes, the Councillors have decided. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> Schiltach must take 220 000 euro in the hand for it. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year the Kinzig Valley Railway. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Especially the safety at level crossings should be increased - regularly nationwide occur collisions of trains with other vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> The municipalities agree to the reconstruction, they must take part with one-third of the cost, railway and Federal share the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained the Municipal Council the peculiarities of Bahübergangs &quot;on the deer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There, the city is planning to build a bulge in the height of the tunnel mouth West of the railway tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> Larger vehicles, for example those that transport timber carrier, could there at oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Grießhaber is therefore proposed to construct the city could widen the subsequent road in due time, to ensure a smooth traffic flow a required retaining wall. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This was in the City Council controversy, since some Councils were the need for a road distribution in doubt: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of critics to the point with his statement: &quot;we need to take as much money in the hand because so few vehicles?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: the level crossing &quot;Deer&quot; become regularly used for timber transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even wood from the area &quot;Kuhbach&quot; will partly transported over this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route Habakuk bridge because there not could turn onto the main road. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In addition the route serve those vehicles which may use the tunnel, as Umleitungfür if the main road is closed, Haas argued. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Refrain was that Kirchberg Schlossberg tunnel would need to be rebuilt and refurbished, as currently is the case in Wolfach, could the level crossing &quot;on the&quot;deer&quot;for an extended period of time an important traffic come to. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The Councils agreed to let what the intended widening of the road would cost study. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Regardless was approved mainly the conversion of the level crossing with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built so that the town &quot;station road&quot;, where appropriate, could expand the subsequent road for encounter traffic about 5.5 m. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The conversion of the level crossing at tannery could Tan, however, entail a completely different problem, concerning the access to the rapidly increasing &quot;Geroltzhäuser way&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The Administration had examined the conversion plans of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path then easily possible. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation came to the conclusion that cannot be ruled out is that the slope conditions of the road could cause, that long vehicles sit on. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The responsibility for this in turn carry the town a road construction load carrier. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The conversion could therefore entail liability disputes. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Since the removal of wood as well as bend in its current state of development work, you should not agree to the modification of the level crossing, argued Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle following the transition is significantly lower than on the other level crossings at this point, because beside the breakpoint Center Taormina, insist to the a good sight. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Even trains from the main train station here should be ready yet slowed down at this point, that no collision threatens. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Majority approval was denied the conversion of this level crossing because the town of Schiltach &quot;would have to suffer the problem with vehicles fitting on&quot;, so the Councils, because the railway could retire after completion of construction from the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The Panel of the tags at the level crossings &quot;Vor Heubach&quot; and &quot;Kuhbach&quot;, for which already crossing agreements have been reached with the railway is considered to be not a problem. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: grow up faster </seg>
<seg id="1449"> African American and Hispanic girls reach puberty as their white peers tend, as studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical changes yet not directly mean puberty </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Should a mother be worried when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> At the annual Conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics&apos;s children Medical Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> &quot;I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents - normally this is no evidence that puberty occurs quickly,&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Obvious indicators of development, such as for example growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor, show earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> However, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (onset of first menstrual period) in the past 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;If the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is controversial, what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but applies it &quot;precocious&quot;, if breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases, slowing down the process or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For faster progress, tests carried out by an Endikronologen could be displayed, so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of a second string: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus a small body growth in adults. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz is restrained, regarding medication, but he admits: &quot;Suppressing puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girls temper, to be different from their peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want, that their very young daughters have the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;You worry because of the risk of pregnancy, or how they manage the hygienic page&quot;, Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose Tochter ten got their days. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> It came from the school home scared and excited, because she was the first in your circle of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> However, there are no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Boys go similar to like girls before puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise was the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged from six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and the entry into puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country, tends to be more African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty as their white peers. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are different explanations for it. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> An early puberty by all kinds of things seems to be affected by economic conditions through the air up to the genes global. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Another puzzle: While boys facial and pubic hair earlier is increasing, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not so pronounced as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other doctors on the AAP Conference underlined the complexity of the issue. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and young children. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> &quot;We have to be careful how we identify the real onset of puberty&quot;, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Parents should not hesitate to consult your pediatrician as they should talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;This may mean that you must have a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If you stay quiet, the child responds normally good. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Girls, early bloom, need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants </seg>

<seg id="1524"> Borussia Dortmund announced affiliated hard consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Before the Friday match against VfB Stuttgart in the Fußball - Bundesliga, the Ultras responded with a silence - first. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustics, the is the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the business between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park offered. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> The visiting fans with their chants were heard mostly. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The South stand against it, where are the most faithful of the faithful--and loudest--BVB fans, presented itself first exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle cries. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> The podium of the CAPO, which otherwise coordinates the common spirit, remained vacant. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> And at the front on the grandstand blew a big flag with inscription &quot;Section stadium ban&quot; alone. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Just as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always first BVB player the place entered, momentary jubilation surged up. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> When his teammates followed, but long not everywhere there loud singing and waving scarves -. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Nothing stirred in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South stand. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel again past the positive experience days - Derby victory, victory over arsenal, renewal of coach Jürgen Klopp - listed was not celebratory mood. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Only five minutes before the kickoff of the CAPO climbed his podium - and until then almost with hands tangible tension erupted in a loud cry, when Daniels as usual asked off the mood in the stands at the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Last was the South grandstand at the series - as always and the loudest place in the stadium was finally here again as usual. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> And no later than when the loud call &quot;Derby winner stands up&quot; came with kick-off from the South stands, everything was as usual. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past few days. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> Just before area Derby FC Schalke 04 some of Borussia Dortmund supporters visitors with had fired flares in the spectator stands and on the Court - and hit almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The match was kicked off late because of the chaotic scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Borussia Dortmund boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund ultras in his Office - and believed to be Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> &quot;There will be massive cuts for the ultra movement as a whole&quot;, the Borussia Dortmund boss announced Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> As an immediate measure, the Ultras Watzke forbade a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart. </seg>

<seg id="1550"> What happens on the way to my email? </seg>
<seg id="1551"> E-Mail is actually electronic letter. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> E-Mail implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to technically secrecy of correspondence such as at the traditional post? </seg>
<seg id="1553"> In the conception of the early Internet services was in the foreground to make communication possible. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Therefore it has taken the basic technical logs not to create a stable foundation for an anhören safe correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Therefore, a conventional E-Mail is more of an open postcard than a sealed letter. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> If user &quot;Anna&quot; to &quot;Benni&quot; send an E-mail, are the computers of the two directly connected? </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The email program or browser by Anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> If she has such a GMail account, Google would be. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> This mail server sends the content to the provider, which uses Benni. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> The mail about several other servers on the Internet can run on the track. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Bennie can then call the content from his provider. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Be conventional emails read on their way through the net? </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Most emails are read by software robots on the road several times. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Usually, the provider of the sender verifies whether the mail leads a malicious program attached to. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> A virus check is also performed on recipient systems. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Also, the provider check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or sorted away at least in a spam folder. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Have the robot yet another task? </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Systems like GMail, the robot detects also the information, which Google requires for placing contextual advertising. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> When Anna and Benni via GMail to communicate about their upcoming holiday travel, Google can display links to holiday offers. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Read the E-Mails and unknown people? </seg>
<seg id="1571"> The likelihood that unauthorized persons read an email, is extremely low. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Theoretically, this is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> In companies, administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> The law enforcement and intelligence agencies have legal possibilities to intercept E-Mails or to take note of. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> There are also possible illegal San Diego from actions. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Is it possible to help protect e-mail messages against the reading? </seg>
<seg id="1577"> With an encryption based on the OpenPGP standard E-Mail can be encrypted effectively against reading. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> With high technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an E-Mail communication, so that not even readily can be recognized, who has communicated with who. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yahoo and Google how important are on the mail market in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> According to a study by Convios consulting from the August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> While the shares of Yahoo mail had finally fallen, GMail from Google could clearly place. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Germany&apos;s largest State Church has an Offensivegestartet to promote the profession of the pastor. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved after current position by 2030. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects, Pastor Mathis bardo (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service said. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> It&apos;s attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Bardo the Lutheran Church has been for the first time a pastor on a full point, to inspire young people to the study of theology. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Currently fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating, to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Bardo traces this to the process of Entkirchlichung: &quot;God&apos;s voice is silent, the world is loud&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> It characterized the profession of great freedom and diversity. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> I am Lord of my appointment calendar and can put there my focus where it is important to me. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Pastors may be close to the people as a pastor. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> You earned as much as teachers and could make a living well. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Certainly get paid in the private sector, but that had theologians a safe employer. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> That do meet the young people of today, where it is a matter not only to career, but a sense of fulfilled work. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> About 60 pastors retire go according to the Lutheran Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently per year. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At the same time, approximately 40 graduates of theological studies begin their Vicariate. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland and Wendland it could be in the future hard to fill positions. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Bardo wants to organise among other study days for young people and invite also celebrities, have studied theology. </seg>

<seg id="1601"> Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff members on allegations against Jonathan Lord accused of sexual offences </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Two YMCA staff from new South Wales (NSW) were accused sexual offences in connection with children, before 2011 accusations against the nursery nurses Jonathan Lord from Sydney were raised, as was the Royal Commission on sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> But when the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared you&apos;ve &quot;never to do with an incident of child sexual abuse in the Organization had&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another, a sports teacher of the YMCA Sydney Hall 1991 familiar to him because of abuse children had been sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Hare Gail Furness, an attorney at assistierenden of the Commission, said that he knew from the first case, but I know the second. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in asserting, &quot;there have been external checks of the YMCA, where the YMCA was considered at forefront of child safety&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Evidence before the Commission shows rather that the YMCA additionally has been informed that he has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of education and communities (Ministry of education) in August of that year. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that management &quot;I&apos;m down&quot; failed in recruiting Lord and not to ensure that staff were themselves via their clear obligations, to report violations to the child safety. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Lord had been sentenced for sexual offenses to twelve young during his two-year tenure for the YMCA at the beginning of the year. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> He was sentenced to at least six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Hare but denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem, which have held employees thereof, to report Lords violations in relation to the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord alone with children was supervised them privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, one said that he love to have it, and let kids play with his cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Danielle Ockwell, whose commanding officer was the Lord and who had asked for a training to protect children because she was concerned because of his behavior, said that the children Services Director Jacqui Barnat, who was the Chief of Lords in the YMCA Sydney, &quot;very intimidating and that was very aloof most of the time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that these not would have dared to report to their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Instead, he said their friendship got compromised rather with their judgment Lord why she had not reported it. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Hare said he told his view of the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW, that the lesson that have to take the organisation from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; affects &quot;not reporting&quot; by employees, and the Board voted to him. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> O&apos;Hare said the decision, the employees to sign non-disclosure commitments shortly after emergence of the allegations to urge was taken by the Executive Director of children services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He said, this should prevent a contamination of the evidence what has been implemented but &quot;overzealous&quot; and bad. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The YMCA NSW was at the time, Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011 there, not organization safe for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission said. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> He explained that there had been &quot;serious problems&quot; in the setting, validation, training, training and supervision of employees. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The hearing was adjourned until December 20. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Tourism: Descent to the Romans </seg>
<seg id="1623"> On 120 meters a sewer from the Roman period remains below from Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Who visited Cologne, not coming to the Cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Some 157 metres stand the two towers in the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree spires, suspecting that there is to discover a lot also in the Cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Rainer Schulze is expert in Cologne underworld. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Meeting point is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Cathedral for the guides. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The tour begins quite unspectacular: &quot;We do, in the underground car park&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only remained standing by the ruins of the ancient city wall, which was not too large. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most users of the car park pass rush so today&apos;s the Roman remains and parking only. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> But look more closely and discovered an archaeological site separated by metal bar on the D2 parking deck. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> About five metres high ruins of Palm-sized stones can be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ,&quot; Schulze said. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before going back to the light of day, Schulze allows participants on the upper level of the Park take a look into a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately not perceived. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Next stop of the tour is the Prätorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Here, we see the headquarters of the once powerful man North of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> What is CCAA, asks a visitor. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Is an abbreviation for&quot; Colonia Claudia ARA Agrippinensium &quot;, which means on good German as much as&quot;City of Roman law and city of asked, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Imperial cult&quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> And the Prätorium is the former Governor&apos;s Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire at the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> By the entrance of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is 120 metres long here to be around. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Schulze guests cheer &quot;You can go along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want to&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> Still, Schulze has a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> After he has obtained the key at the box office, he leads the group to a walk-in, 16-meter-deep shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> &quot;We are now in the Mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath&quot;, he explains. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washing. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Today, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine are readable in the bottom of the Mikvah, the roots of which go back to the eighth century. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The Mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for the construction soon to begin. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> But still some years to completion. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> Land Rover Rally series announced </seg>
<seg id="1652"> In the Interior you will find racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as a hands-free system. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with care by bowler-works mechanics and logistical support up to vehicle storage between events. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Drew bowler, CEO of bowler Motorsport, explains: &quot;The rally customers who come to bowler, have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1655"> They are not all experienced racing driver, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible way to world class events. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We are happy to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different disciplines of rally in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rigors and the reality of rally raid. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> We really had fun doing it, to develop the Defender challenge truck – this is a fun Championship. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> In addition, there is a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert racing in North Africa and the Middle East during the Defender challenge. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> George Kerevan: European unbundling is the choice the Scots </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new horror story to independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This provides the cue for stories about Passport checks in Berwick and secured with barbed wire boundary along the Hadrian. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> In fact was in the Strathclyde template on the potential economic benefits pointed out, which would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe with it, but this did not matter - as expected - in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Also, no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often bend their strict rules is, if it is convenient for them. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Because Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want out of the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> So actually no story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And one that has been in the years, that she already looks like a fossil: the first time I have the &quot;Independence means passport controls&quot; duck is at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> This is an interesting point in the constant repeat of this ancient history lost. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should you expect from an independent Scotland, that it is dancing to the European tune? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why the London pass against the Brussels Exchange, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> This is the real European news: the great, after the war plan to the unification of Europe has been stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the euro crisis, the European project is officially died. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Everywhere in the EU gain ground parties, which are hostile to the EU, or want to have the euro as their currency on board. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election could get the Eurosceptic party alternative for Germany - until this year founded - for himself in September and effectively the free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) expel from the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There has always been local resistance to the plan, to create a federalist Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The current economic crisis turns out however as a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the single currency, many people of consider, the European project had gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The euro crisis has little to do with that national governments create excessive budget deficits - this was the case only in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead the Eurosystem, has nailed down its members on exchange rates are favorable for German exporters – and German politicians would like to allow this. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, South Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The only way is to cut the wages and public spending - spurred by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> A deeper going European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and currency problems. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a result of the &quot;green&quot; energy policies prescribed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry will pay twice that for electricity and for gas fourfold compared with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All wage codification of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry to being marginalized by cheap American shale gas in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> As a result, a revolt coming the former cheerleaders of the EU, particularly in France. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which you could keep Germany at Bay and lift Paris on par with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But Berlin needs Paris no longer as the gateway to the political legitimacy and put up its own economic policy Europe, which the struggling French economy has to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Marine Le Pens EU hostile, right-wing National Front has won just a crucial by-election and so that the ruling Socialists referenced three in place. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The most popular party in France with 24 percent of the popular vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party, the national front that she can not assume now is a split in the right-wing would automatically mean advantages for the left. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What does Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> She want the EU elections next year use an anti-EU-, to forge anti - Community currency block in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If the anti-EU parties in these elections do well - and this is very possible - then such a block could dominate for the first time the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point on which I&apos;m going: in the not-too-distant future the growing resentment of the EU and the common currency is to meet to the abolition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but she will be rather something like &quot;EDN (sovereign)&quot;, which was in favor of General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Germany and some of its satellite economies may adhere to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Great Britain distanced themselves from this project hoping to curry favor with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> However, Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain will stand. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where is Scotland in all of this? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can decide to be small England a region (in last consequence). </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also belongs to Berlin and Brussels say what they where can put up. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I guess Scotland could go quite well in a looser European grouping, as long as we retain our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The cooperation with other, like-minded countries is easier in a non-Federated Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise, we should consider to join Norway and keep our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The SNP Government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won the 2011 a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts, the labour Finance Minister Alistair had to take responsibility for Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> It would be ridiculous to decide now for an independence for Scotland, only then to get from Berlin and Brussels imposed an austerity. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> FAA: passengers can use now electronic devices aboard aircraft (but no cell phone conversations) </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Passengers can now take-off until landing, hear their electronic devices to read, work, games, music and use watching films, but not with the mobile phone as the new guidelines, which issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> But should the passengers do not expect that these changes be implemented immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How quickly they would implement, depended on by the airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The airlines must have the FAA, that aircraft comply with new guidelines and that they have updated the training manual of the flight personnel, as well as the arrangements for the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA said it got already plans by some airlines, which would expand the use of portable electronic devices in-flight. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> These airlines were also delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> &quot;Depending on the State of the plan we could approve soon the expanded use of electronic devices&quot;, was announced by the FAA in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Currently passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices, if the aircraft doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> They may start again until, when the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> At the entrance to the landing to the passengers turn it off again and may not restart it, before the plane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose Flugzeuge be secured against electronic interference could allow its passengers even at launch, landing and on the runway to use the devices, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> The most new airliners and other planes, which were converted at higher altitudes, for the use of Wi-Fi, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, President of the Professional Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> &quot;If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we cooperate in this regard with the airline - both will benefit from page&quot; Glading said. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> We are frankly tired of having to feel on this subject such as supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> However, Internet connections were prohibited, for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the Authority said. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Passengers will be prompted to the flight mode smartphones, tablets and other devices. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> So still no &quot;words with friends&quot;, the Scrabble-like online game, playing the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his Smartphone, he public had to leave an American Airlines jet, because he refused to switch off the device, while it was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> And heavier equipment such as laptops must also continue to be stored, since here a danger of injury, if they fly through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Cell phone conversations are also prohibited during the flight. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulatory competence for telephone calls between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA revokes ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing may be </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Last month Mark Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News said phones would still considered risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Mobile are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can disrupt also masts&quot;, so Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> An Advisory Committee of industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue in life, recommended last month that the Government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In recent years, the pressure has risen to the FAA to loosen restrictions for use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued that there was no valid security reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> In some studies, that forgets to turn the unit off up to a third of the passengers or ignored is. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA started in 1966, to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices by VHF radios carried by passengers became known, which at that time represented the latest technology trend. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New aircraft are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA, that electronic interference bother them. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines offer passengers for several years Wi-Fi when the altitude is reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The flyer adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Today&apos;s electronic devices give generally much less phone radiation than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you scroll around. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> But the transfer values are stronger during the download or sending data. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Amazon.com is one of the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on device use by passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> 2011 invited an airliner full of Kindle E-reader company employees and made a test flight, to identify issues, not observed but. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings, regarding the risk associated with the use of equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd of the passenger Association of National Association of airline passengers said, he believes, the interference by the device was real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other Committee members said there were only scattered reports of pilots who militated for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Committee recommended however the FAA to allow pilots to order switching off the devices by passengers in instrument landing under conditions of poor visibility. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable accommodation for travelers who are today extensively equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience not contrary to the safety stands,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> Jumbo visited the Black Forest ham </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Jumbo on the search for the &quot;best ham in the world&quot;: for the TV programme &quot;Galileo&quot; visited the Pro7-star Baloyi village. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The speaker right at the beginning makes it clear: the pig thighs are the most important for the ham, Turbo mast is not a good condition. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Ham, you get in every supermarket, can be a quality product? </seg>
<seg id="1757"> As head of a large ham factory in the Black Forest, the functioning of the company &quot;Adler&quot; in Bonndorf ULI explains jumbo. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Germany&apos;s favorite ham&quot;, such as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Only with hair protection and overall he comes inside the factory. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> As Jumbo must disinfect first hands himself, before he is allowed access to the micro. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Spotted jumbo to strengthen at fast food in Waldshut </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;Here is worked, huge amounts of me&quot; amazed the television makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> 16,000 drumsticks per week speak for themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Weight, fat percentage, color: Uli explains what is quality. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> Most pigs are slaughtered at six months. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Television with level? </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Details such as the pH of the meat play a role. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The darker the meat, the higher the ph value. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;Since I am curious, if ye mete Roberto Blanco, what happens then&quot;, so Jumbo cynical. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> The level of private television in its purest form is presented here. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> But worth watching. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> The viewer sees that breaking down the leg is still handmade. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> For: Black Forest ham is traditional without finding bones in the shelf. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The secret of the ham is the seasoning with salt. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Smoke Tower and smoke firing reminiscent of Jumbo visually a &quot;submarine&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> The trick: Fir-tree branches provide for the special flavor of Black Forest ham in smoke. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> 20 days in the smoke make the ham finally almost black. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> &quot;Now the disc in the jumbo disappears&quot;, he announces the test restores. </seg>

<seg id="1780"> So that everyone can live. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Freudenstadt: Fast action take by surprise host </seg>
<seg id="1782"> With a small squad, the men I TSV had to make Freudenstadt in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> The Älbler were indeed with an experienced team on the other side of the net. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> But soon showed that they, also age-related, not quite could keep up with the quick actions of Freudenstadt. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> With the hard and placed spreads, the Gönninger did hard extremely. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Repeatedly missed it that by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean passes zugespielten power Center and attacks and were on the block defense not to the point. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> In the face of this overwhelming and decisive game performance the third set became something feeble and listless 3-0-full time (25:13, 25:14:25: 22) won. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> A much more powerful opponent is there on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly prevailed in Nagold, on the field. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dabbous, Felix P.s, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> In the B-class the second teams of Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> You delivered a hard-fought two hour match. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Nervousness on both sides especially in the reception of the ball caused errors and point gifts; also in the passports, the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical scenes, the zeal prevented the look for possible point gains. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> In this performance very balanced encounter the great physical and a pleasing commitment of both teams agreed the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto but consistently. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: No absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want to include early residents in the planning&quot;, Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens information event to the flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Around 80 participants arrived in the Community Hall to let explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Hale made it clear: &quot;The ultimate decisions make the members of the Council&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The flood, which took Gechingen on May 15, 2009, was a dramatic event that raised the question for protective measures for the future, so Hale. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, in order, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;As many cultivated land protection is the goal,&quot; Halimah. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> The planning is based the protection against a flood to be expected statistically every 100 years according to the German weather service. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Climate change will be taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> This is called &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot; in professional circles. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The water masses that 2009 had resulted in Gechingen considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year flood. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement&quot;, so Hale. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be, invested in Gechingen, whereby the community can expect with land grants amounting to about 70 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Hale but pointed out that the promotion is there only if an overall concept will be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This is the community on the participation of citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> An elaborate planning and approval procedures must be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> 2016 could be started to implement in the best case. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Among other things, the protection concept, which already was presented last week in the Council (as reported) foresees local measures in the tributary of the river IRM Stammheimer Valley. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Among other things has been questioned, why not more dams and reservoirs to protect of the site were planned. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregor Kühn, planners of the responsible Engineering Office of forest and Corbe from Hill&apos;s home, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all introduced measures to achieve the desired goal in total. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> In addition, it was held to find the most economical solution, so Woods and Corbe Wald of Joachim. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Resentment was among residents of the old town, who repeatedly suffer even at normal rainstorm under an overload of the channel network. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The problem is known to the management and initial measures have already been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Halder pointed out however, that the guidelines for channel systems are others, for flood protection, and this should not be mixed. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The municipality was required to produce the sewer system so that two-to three-year rain events could be coped with. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> To dimension the sewers, larger oil could cost millions. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new Café. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> One that invites you to relax and come back. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> One that wants to make the name of the program. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling, having already experienced or seen a new situation according to the lexicon. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> In the case of the visit of the homonymous Cafés on the Opschlag in the District of Kleve within sight to the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it must not remain vu feeling at the pure Déjà. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only intellectually, but by hand always recurring experience. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Because it is fun and is just beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A look into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives a good feeling the viewers right off the bat. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> The State of the art, but not cool Café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> Here, the team offers the guest with various coffee or cocktail variant with the founders of Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> There&apos;s delicious cake or individual fresh sandwiches. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The owners, both 33 years old, have already before the opening of the pretty Café at the Opschlag as restaurateurs a made name for itself: in Kranenburg, they introduced the &quot;art lounge&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> By moving to Kleve on the Opschlag, the sympathetic Café lovers expect more audience. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Not least because of the College. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> &quot;While we have no specific target group,&quot; stresses Daniel Büttner. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Rather she would like to address just two young students such as seniors and all ages in between. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> Speaking of coffee lovers. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The sympathetic owner pair behind the coffee. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> Enjoy the fragrant hot BREW in a variety of variations itself. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Expressofan </seg>
<seg id="1842"> Daniel Büttner tends to be the cappuccino drinker of Expresso fan and Mirjam van the Stelt. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> &quot;This includes a baguette - thats my thing&quot;, she reveals the NRZ. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> There was two events even in the bright Café. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> One rather. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Because the harbour Festival took place Yes more outdoors - déjà vu Café not benefited. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> But there was also the night of Ringelnatz. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> &quot;Beautiful, successful and funny&quot;, found the two 33-year-old. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> But just not for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Maybe Daniel Büttner is also no outspoken fan of event evenings: &quot;May&apos;s Yes now even not all right to make&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> And an event I was talking to only that, who are also interested in the special event. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Therefore, events will be more the exception for us. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> &quot;We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Do you mean: Déjà vu also stands for reliability. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> As regards the quality of products, which here are, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve, Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The road, which are more and more becoming a food mile. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> To the delight of many Kamuhanda, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the guest Rome haste and hence the Café Déjà vu for themselves. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo manufacturer arguing in the face of large orders over seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Between leading aircraft manufacturers has triggered a dispute over the width of the seats in the economy class on long-haul flights, what this month sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The dispute revolves around the seat width, which offered passengers on long flights in economy class not always those the airlines most seek but this designated space represents the key for the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.&apos;s efficiency claims. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus called an industry standard prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the American arch-rival Boeing says airlines should decide this week. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The dispute comes at a time, because aircraft manufacturers that compete to sell even bigger versions of its twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and record orders expected event from November 17 to 21. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> How is the rear part of the aircraft - in particular whether there are series with nine or ten seats-, is crucial for the economic outputs, which will provide the new &quot;mini Jumbo&quot; design. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing claims its modernized &quot;777 X&quot; believe 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and allow to ten per row. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus said the competing version of the A350 promote 350 people in 18-inch-wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per row. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Aircraft giants deal often blows over technical details by means of advertisements in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Now Airbus before the appeals Dubai Airshow, where 777 X probably will make the race with over 100 orders directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Recently, the company introduced a display, which are the beginning of a new ad war could and donors showed a picture, in the three persons together-squashed in a restaurant the title sit, and: &quot;Would you accept that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;Boeing proposes long-haul seats, which are narrower than regional turbo-props&quot;, says Airbus sales Chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> In the face of changed eating habits, people are fatter, but aircraft seats have not radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> The weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years of age by ten per cent has increased between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, so the data of the Department of health. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The waist size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to us health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says his rival think on a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized &quot;Jet set&quot; was narrow. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> You have carried out to Airbus, investigations showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increase sleep quality by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing denies the figures from Airbus to the mass of the seat and says, it is not at the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between fare and set up. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The company also said according to research the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> &quot;It boils down really to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they need in their opinion, to succeed&quot;, explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver by Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> They don&apos;t want that we dictate them what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> You know your business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers, it is about the freedom of more elbow, but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Behind the confrontation is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could permanently affect the export record of the United States or Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seating layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent of more efficiency per seat with their latest twin-engined long-range designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Boeing statements on the results of partly depend on the 777 X comparing to their 10 seats per row with the original design of the nine seats in the 777. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The higher costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;Boeing squeezing more seats on his plane so, to make it more competitive to our products&quot;, says Kevin Keniston, Director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the closer position, what could go hand in hand with cheaper airfares. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: the Airbus offer the threat of the 777 is controlled from an economic point of view&quot;, says Mary Kirby, an expert in cabin decor, founder and editor of runway girl network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing offer no seats on, but a catalogue of suppliers, which the airlines can choose from. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The globe-trotting Jet seller carry even tape to measure after the establishment of the competition. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers offer also jets with high density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater series, has not sold but according to his own words. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently, Airbus has stressed how important is more customizability of cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer&apos;s great modern jets, experts say that the reputation will probably fizzle out according to a new industry standard, but could distract from the wave of 777X-Verkäufen. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Veganism vegetarianism is subordinated according to dictionaries, differs from it but in a very significant way. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> While vegetarians afford eating cream pie, ice cream, or a strong Edam, these feasts are not available on the menu of a comparatively? </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to refraining from meat and fish will drain the vegans of all consuming of animal products - honey is in the negative. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> You may ask yourself what remains, but on closer inspection the vegan diet world characterized by a considerable ingenuity. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Spreads are very popular,&quot; says Ute Hamilton, the owner of the local Reformhauses, which provides a wide range of special products for vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Also, Reuben Proctor popular shop in Domgasse. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The native New Zealander living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything, what he needs to live. &quot;in 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Around the turn of the century, the next step was then and I was vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came not only because of the food, but because the shoe choice&quot;, says Proctor, who prefers normal leather leatherette. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> He realized that it&apos;s also in other everyday matters without animal products. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> First and foremost, be an ethic is vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I don&apos;t want that animals for me to die,&quot; Proctor is the maxim of the vegan, which extends to the entire consumer behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Behind restore mourn instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or Gummi bears have discovered the vegan fast new products, the enthusiasm has grown. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;It&apos;s a double bonus,&quot; Proctor says today, &quot;actually vegan represents his no waiver, no asceticism, but it is an asset&quot;. The assumption that it will reduce the range of dining options with the nutrition, rather traces Proctor to the force of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> And exactly these conditionings gave also some well intentioned attempt fail. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The addiction factor is a decisive factor that quickly abandon many leaves, similar to smoking,&quot; Proctor establishes a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> And objects: &quot;Certain tastes are not to make the animal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> It&apos;s often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;You can create the same effect but also in other ways&quot;, illustrates the vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Proctor brings, for example, aubergines, mushrooms, and also a few Veganwürste to a barbecue. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly also once hearty taste. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Of course you want to have something in my teeth, which is legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It should taste, but this is not only to reduce animal food&quot;, as Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Up to eating disorders, a more widespread acceptance, he had not suffered damage to health. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> For me, the changeover was a positive aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I take no foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high-performance athletes who only vegan eats. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;My blood levels are fine, I often check me&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Many Vegansimus critics warn especially the deficiency of vitamin B12. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;As fed animals with feed, rather than graze on the pasture, it is questionable whether the proportion of vitamin B12 is high in the meat you buy in the freezer,&quot;, will Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For vegans, there is also the possibility to use the Coenzyme in the form of tablets. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B12 levels are in order,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Proctor for the procurement of food must not go long distances. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Staple it finally everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> I find everything I need on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Only once in a while I buy something special. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people overlook that just finished products are expensive, but so, in&quot;ordinary&quot;finished products known to be also.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Anyway, preparing vegetarian dishes is far cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;There is much to discover in the House kitchen, with a few small tweaks to good, if not sometimes better results,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, more baking soda and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake brought his in-laws also Proctor to amaze. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> The vegan family festivals gives a new spice. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> It has dynamics, together to Cook, has a new role. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Of course, but scepticism was taken him. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> No longer do you like my food? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> &quot;Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?&quot; - these questions one must act as vegans with flair. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I don&apos;t dislike the people Yes, I&apos;m part of this society,&quot; Proctor want to eke out no enclave existence. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And reexamined the everyday world is not so veganfremd as suspected - and restricted the vegan not so in everyday life as commonly assumed. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Fast Food is allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> French fries are everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many Dönerläden offer falafel at, or just a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; Proctor says. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> He dodges on pasta dishes in a pizzeria, or ordered just a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The restaurants prepare so slowly. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> &quot;When I, started 13 years ago to feed me, vegan everything was much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealander can identify a development: &quot;One must talk to the people, that they draw attention&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;If enough issues to come, they are inclined to complement the menu maybe&quot;, he hopes. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Vegan develop restaurants, outlawed such as for example the galley in Mannheim or the Café. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Proctor has the desire that other restaurants are on the menu at least a vegan dish have. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Basically are there vegan meals for all. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Everyone can eat them, they are so opposite of exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> &quot;Meat dishes are, however, exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,&quot; Proctor says. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> &quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make the greatest of inherently impossible&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Shopping could be difficult at the beginning but vegetarian products. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Especially if you learn to understand that also peanuts animal food additives as a color timer included in its can, seems one quick compliance ethics with so many obstacles and traps with the courage to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Not only because Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen, have written a book: &quot;Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives&quot; explains the many ingredients used in food, but also detergents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> &quot;After one developed a scanner look and know which characters and Proctor knows&quot;It is sometimes better to do small steps as to stop or stumble,&quot;has to make logos. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Veganism, it is an important moral finger, hitting on the consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Maybe it not quite manages that it pushes his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to challenge his habits. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Bavaria&apos;s basketball despite first defeat optimistic </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Itself the first defeat in the Euroleague could not detract from the huge optimism at the rumours of the FC Bayern Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> &quot;Nobody can forbid us to believe to win against the best team in Europe of over the past two years,&quot; concluded Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening when defending champion of Olympiakos Piräus. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> We have sent the message: basketball exists also in Munich! </seg>
<seg id="1967"> At her only third appearance in the European Premier sold the Munich long very well, but just not settled down enough in the crucial stages. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> The guests first managed the feat still a guide to convert a 15-point deficit 13 minutes before the end, before Piräus again gave the game a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> &quot;We have made us incredibly fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again reckless mistake&quot;, said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Malcolm Delaney and Trenton Daniel were the most successful pitchers of Munich had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian champions Montepaschi Siena and the Polish champion in Zielona Góra. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> New nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure smoking kill </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Further attempts is needed before testing on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy once help millions of smokers who can, tried to stop and it tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that your nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches&quot;, so Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies selectively. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibody Hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker learns no nicotine high. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In trials, vaccinated mice, nicotine has been administered, maintained their normal activity level. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Mice without vaccination, however, had taken a &quot;break&quot;, said the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The experiments are described in the journal Science translational medicine. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Former tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the level of antibodies, that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The cost of the new vaccine are likely significantly lower, however, he transformed liver cells into antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if he was sure, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent to nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> But more likely is that smokers would employ him to quit. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;You know then: if they start to smoke again they feel no pleasure more here because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to drop the habit&quot;, he explains. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned it was necessary to further research. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Guillaume Nicloux&apos; adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinced has exceptional production facilities and contemporary details, but also heavier food than necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> The plot playing in the France of the 1760s tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent by her family to the monastery. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> When she rebelled, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic matron and becomes an object of erotic fascination with another. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> The film never down slides into lasciviousness or sensationalism - and therein lies his problem. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The solemn seriously, the movie is told with the, makes it also for the audience the quälerischen hair shirt. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Egypt inaugurated the first freely-elected President </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Mohammed Mursi pushes the oath of Office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot;, as he was sworn in as the country&apos;s first freely elected President, and so joined the successor of Husni Mubarak, was expelled from Office 16 months previously. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and Egypt&apos;s fifth head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy was about 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> He took the oath before the 18 judges of the Court dressed in black robes, which has its headquarters on the River Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian Temple. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> &quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic,&quot; Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on State television. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> &quot;Today the Egyptian people the basis for a new life has created - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability&quot;, said the 60 year old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that sharp had been taken since its inception 84 years ago mostly as a banned organisation by each Government in the visor. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Mursi arrived shortly after 11 P.m. local time in a small car convoy. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Only a few hundred supporters gathered before the Court, to cheer the new President, and in contrast to the presidential pageantry of the Mubarak era the traffic paused only for a short time, so that the auto convoy could cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> As uncharismatisches &quot;spare wheel&quot; the brotherhood mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he portrayed himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those, who wanted to bring the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak at the destination. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> &quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,&quot; said the judges in the wood-paneled Chamber in which he took the oath of Office the Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should hold his inaugural speech. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, which he listened to in pirogues. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> The military commander field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of present in the largest Auditorium of the University with chants of &quot;the army and the people are a hand&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> In the 1970s the University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> Mursi took a symbolic oath in Tahir square on Friday, to reclaim presidential powers to the birthplace of the rebellion, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed, the military Council of the head of State hunted from the Office had taken over. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> But with the drop of the official oath before the Court and not as usual in front of the Parliament, he leans on the will of the military, suggesting that the power struggle will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Morsi&apos;s speech on the t square was full of dramatic, populist gestures. </seg>

<seg id="2030"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 by passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Frontier Airlines, intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though to read the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead bin above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Frontier said that you calculate when the fee shall paid in advance, $ 25, and $ 100 for travellers who only paid at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate o&apos; Malley said, the fee of $ 100 aimed persuading travelers to take care of in the run-up to the payment. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> &quot;We would not calculate this sum&quot;, she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> 2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second checked bag. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> Passengers who tried to get around them, so as much as possible stuffed in hand luggage, which has resulted in that the overhead bins above the seat are often crowded. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Fees are a way to move to less take on board passengers to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> O&apos;Malley said the new fee it a matter of not really making money. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> It involves the most loyal customers of frontier, which would have brought clear that there would be harder to find space in the compartment above the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers who buy tickets on the airline&apos;s website, don&apos;t have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> This means that a passenger at the gate by frontier circumstances may take one piece of baggage free of charge, must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage the next person but. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O&apos;Malley told the website of frontier and the check-in procedure would changed so that the passengers of the fee be informed before they came to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The new carry-on fee of frontier enters into force only in the summer, an exact date does not exist yet. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers often ranting about luggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines fall like that. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> They argue that the transport of baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted him. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> So far however, most keep their hands off fees for carry-on. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for baggage and followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airlines. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The only other airline with a such fee the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitored the additional fees said. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> He estimated in a report by December 2011, the carry-on fee every year bring a spirit $ 50 million. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Sorensen, who previously held a management position with Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what would expect him at the boarding gate when passengers would be faced with the unusual baggage fee of the company. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> &quot;The boarding process was among the smoothest I&apos;ve seen in my career in the aviation industry,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions at the boarding gate. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> &quot;The plane was full,&quot; he said, &quot;and the boarding went smoothly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Frontier follows spirit in the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, soda, or juice. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The company said that passengers, soda, or juice bought, which should keep the whole box and coffee will refill free. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Water is still free. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> US Airways 2008 briefly attempted to charge for soft drinks, made this but seven months later reversed after passengers had complained and no other large company was drawn. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Frontiers step, to charge for carry-on baggage, if passengers do not directly with the airline to buy, is the latest initiative, with the customer on the website are to be channelled. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Airlines pay 10 to 25 dollars per ticket sold online travel agencies like Orbitz. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> It provides all companies an incentive to move passengers to directly purchase from them rather than through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Frontier is gone however most widely in this area. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> In September, began the company, assign only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 per cent of flight. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> A flight booked at a third-party with frontier over 1000 miles brings customers to you therefore only have 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Passengers can reserve seats only when purchasing direct on the frontier website. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business contracting, the company loses money. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> The proceeds fell by 9 per cent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, how to read the financial report on Wednesday from the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., is released. </seg>

<seg id="2125"> John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission of the US espionage was &quot;inappropriate gone too far&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2126"> John Kerry has hinted a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States in relation to their monitoring programmes with an unexpected admission by saying that the espionage was gone in certain cases&quot;inappropriately too far&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> The Foreign Minister also admitted he bear the responsibility that you turned on &quot;Autopilot&quot;, as the explosive revelations of Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities together with Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The U.S. Government got from its allies in a diplomatic storm of indignation by the leaked information. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In a speech transmitted via video link to the open Government Conference in London said Kerry: &quot;Without question the President and I and others have experienced in the Government of some things that are expired simply because the ability to do so was still on the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war almost on autopilot and of course goes back to 9 / 11.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Then, he of the U.S. Government admitted as a first senior member, that the US espionage have crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> He said: &quot;In some cases that has inappropriate too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore performs a thorough investigation so nobody must feel, this abuse takes place. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> I can assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Kerry insisted however, that the NSA was a force of for good, and through its monitoring operations had saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> He added: &quot;We have to do it, people are ready to blow themselves up in the air with a new world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2136"> There is a radical extremism in the world, who is intent on killing people, to blow up in the air and attacking governments. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> So, what if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens? </seg>
<seg id="2138"> We actually have plane crashes, attacks on buildings and prevented the murder of people, because we have experienced in the run-up to such plans. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe, to dispel the misgivings of the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need, in the anti-terrorist efforts to continue with the United States to cooperate, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned because of their threats, due to frustration over the monitoring by the national security agency no longer anti-terrorist organizations to participate in. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> &quot;It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism to stay aboard,&quot; said Murphy, who sits and is active as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on foreign relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington for the first time in the Senate as a Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> Also I&apos;m going to Europe, there to make it clear that we still must work together in the fight against terrorism, notwithstanding their anger about the NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence agency this week said the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies had been collected and exchanged with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Other revelations have quoted from documents provided by Snowden, stating that the NSA have monitored the phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of State worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> The Director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying among allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority preparing the journey of the Congress, which this year will take place, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and Chambers. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> He said the exact itinerary will worked out. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement in relations, he said also that there would be some &quot;serious words&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> He said European Governments should be to honest about the kind of spyware their population, which they themselves for years. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Although we can change our monitoring programs, and better protect the rights of Europeans, they must come to terms but also with the fact, that we are not the only ones that spy, so Murphy. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> Meanwhile a trip in the Middle East and Poland pending for John Kerry at the weekend, meet up there with the resentment over the American strategy in Syria, to deal with Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. monitoring activities. </seg>

<seg id="2156"> A new sandbox needs of kindergarten? </seg>
<seg id="2157"> All kindergartens, nurseries and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis district can get involved in the action. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> If you have a construction or beautification desire for your institution, you can compete with this at the Black Forest messengers. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of action kindergarten construction site. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> A jury, consisting of selects three wishes Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, representatives from all entries. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> What are the requirements to participate are there? </seg>
<seg id="2162"> The desire should be to realize day with construction material to the value of 2000 EUR and a (action). </seg>
<seg id="2163"> In addition, the winner must take care of many hardworking construction helpers. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> What is the day of the action and the helpers to? </seg>
<seg id="2165"> Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It will be delivered on the agreed day in kindergarten and to be processed directly by the helpers. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course tutors and children themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflict of interest when the parental leave </seg>
<seg id="2169"> The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans to the parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and therefore benefit. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> The mining magnate, located in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, raised the allegation as he wanted to wipe issues off the table, if it were in a conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or shortened. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> However, Palmer claimed that only Ministers might have conflicts of interest and by Abbott personally by the laws would benefit the daughters. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> &quot;It is located in a big conflict of interest, when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not it receives holiday,&quot; Palmer said. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> Two months after the election the Electoral Commission Palmer explained officially the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax lead with 53 votes after the recount. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Palmer called for a revision of the process to the counting of the vote, make this go faster. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Tony Abbott&apos;s daughters Frances and Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Should these elections two months after the end of voting be decided? </seg>
<seg id="2178"> &quot;We need a better system,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Why should we have a system where one came in March, enters the data into a computer, immediately selects and then at 6:30 in the evening has the result? </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Palmer criticized the use of pencils for marking the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> To use them, because you then can rub out the results, if it&apos;s not to like? </seg>
<seg id="2182"> It is unbelievable today agree with pencils. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint Bill with New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Palmer, 59, said that an international airport for the Sunshine Coast belong to his policies and that he will take his new position &quot;very seriously&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> When a public official, it involves the public service. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> &quot;We are seeking any reward except the history, namely, that we can serve this community in a critical period&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> ESA decides on large space missions: missions for billions </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Distant planets, gravitational waves and black holes - the European Space Agency experts must agree now on two major projects, that want to start in the next few years. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 proposals were available, five are still in the race. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> More than 1000 planet while other stars have already been astronomers. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The selection is difficult: you should search for gravitational waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Or search for Earth-like planets and discover that perhaps alien life? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> These questions just those responsible in the European Space Agency ESA. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For their program &quot;cosmic vision&quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such &quot;L &apos;missions is roughly one billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The start will be 2028 2034 expected. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> In early September the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were to debate, five of them are now come in the shortlist. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check for the researchers. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> A final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee should fall in the next few days. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> ESA has selected four major issues on which the missions of programme initiated in 2007 &quot;cosmic vision&quot; to find answers. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact operations are in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets orbiting this star - still in the proverbial dark. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this obscurity. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances life can arise there? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> To investigate this question, the space telescope &quot;Cheops&quot; is to start in 2017 with the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity are investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The possibilities are limited but, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With larger instruments astronomers could represent Earth-like planets and analyze even the composition of their atmospheres and so search for &quot;Biomarkers&quot;: gases, considered an indication for biological activity. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Also this question to indicate finally, what requirements there are for the emergence of life. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A star&apos;s magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as of his particles emitted with the planetary system plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> These operations can be an exemplary study in our solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot; ESA approved already an M-class Mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe should start 2017 and observe surface and activity of the Sun. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Even Jupiter and its moons are of great interest to researchers. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> You want to find out what role played the giant planet in the development of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> For the ESA sees the first of the three L missions of the &quot;cosmic vision&quot; program before. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The probe of &quot;Juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins their journey expected to 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Eight years later it reached Jupiter and to examine the atmosphere of the planet, as well as the icy moons, Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the known laws of nature are still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> You might find yourself also deviations which could point the way to a new theory of the physicists, under whose umbrella unite all known laws of nature. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> How the universe came about and what is it made of? </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Our cosmos was created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> In addition to the US common matter of stars, planets and living beings as we consist of, there is dark matter, whose Schwerkraft holding together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through whose work the expansion of the universe accelerating. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> So far, the researchers know, what physical laws in the first seconds of the big bang were valid, nor what are dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> With &quot;Euclid&quot; ESA approved here already a M mission, whose starting is planned for 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> With a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and allow to draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could make the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the 30 proposals only two are left at the end of the selection process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> An ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves has according to many experts &quot;E-Lisa&quot;, the best chances for a permit as a L mission. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space and time, which had predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Demonstrated they were not until today. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes will be stationed at all. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> He could demonstrate also gravitational waves in contrast to plants on the Earth during the big bang, and provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope named &quot;Athena&quot;, which, among other black holes to explore, &quot;Icy planets&quot;, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism&quot;, a mission to measure the cosmic microwave background, and the &quot;Extrasolar Planet Finder&quot; to uncover the Earth-like planets and examine. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Among other proposals to the samples back from Mars, the Moon, Venus, and asteroids, and solar physics research are already eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> CDC publish allergy policies for schools </seg>
<seg id="2243"> On Wednesday, the Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> These are the first such guidelines, which published the American Government, increasing the number of school-age children with food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The dissemination of food allergies among children has increased between 1997 and 2007 to 18 percent according to the CDC. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The guidelines provide information for schools that the Faculty and staff to awaken an awareness of food allergies and allergic reactions show how to deal with children. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> It is also recommended that schools epinephrine in stock - the car of the brand EpiPen injection is most commonly used - who encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction to. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The legislature changed recently the rules in the States, so that schools can easily hold epinephrine. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Also a list of typical symptoms is included in the report are called by children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Children may say: &quot;It feels, as if pushing something on my tongue&quot;, &quot;My tongue feels like a hair it is&quot; or &quot;My tongue tingles&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry called firemen to the rescue of a shy, stranded </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was ran away after a minor traffic accident </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Three days later she was discovered by a Walker in the quarry in their predicament </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Firefighters stranded off to cliff and rescued the dog before the safe death </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Firefighters succeeded in bringing a puppy in security that was stuck on a 15-meter lead into a rock wall. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was running away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone, before she was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, belongs to the dog that came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to put Ruby back in reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published calls for help in social networks, as it was on the loose after the small traffic accident in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Around 14:15 CET on Wednesday, a Walker, who said his dog, saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the site and rappelled off himself to save Ruby&apos;s, which was then transported in a crate upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: &quot;she was in a dangerous position. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> It was located in the middle of the rock face - 15 meters from the top and the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> During their rescue, she moved a muscle - it was stiff as frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> But now it&apos;s fine. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> She ate a few dog biscuits. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> It was a pretty unusual usage. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The fact that the dog was discovered, is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Peter LAU, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: &quot;Ruby had a big happiness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2270"> There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> Ruby was taken to the vet&apos;s Office to investigate, but found nothing except for exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Becky Hall in Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;to watch the rescue was scary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2273"> I couldn&apos;t believe that she was really there. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> It was wonderful to hold again in the arms. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The vet said if would be the exhaustion has become too large and they collapsed, she would be probably crashed. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The firefighters have done great. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> It was really brave, what they have done. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> We are just so thankful and each of them was absolutely amazing. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Scott Alderson from Keighley added: &quot;we were afraid that she would fall off, but it stayed up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2280"> The firefighters were great. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> I can&apos;t believe where she was. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> U.S. border: &quot;Super-tunnel&quot; to drug trafficking discovered </seg>
<seg id="2283"> On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a &quot;Super-tunnel&quot; to drug smuggling and shut down. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> As the US Customs authorities informed the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system was fitted. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms cocaine seized. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The tunnel was not made yet according to use. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> &quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they could burrow through under the radar throughout,&quot; said the Deputy Public Prosecutor of the U.S. District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference prior to a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> On the drug gangs used insured Duffy: &quot;If your next build such tunnels and tries to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The US authorities as well as the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Since 2006, more than 77 000 were killed people in connection with drug-related crime in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Designed by experts </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Due to the extensive facilities of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it has been designed by architects and engineers and that the building took about a year to complete. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> The track layout was so equipped that there electric powered carts could be used. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> There is access to a building is 80 metres from the border Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> According to authorities, a ladder leads to the actual entrance of the tunnel 20 meters in depth. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 m high and 90 cm wide. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> He would have been also suitable to direction of United States to encourage illegal immigration. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine finding. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the seized marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Lifetime imprisonment threatens all three as a maximum penalty, as officials said. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Since 2006, eight such tunnels had been discovered, it was said at the press conference in San Diego continue. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> But it was the first time that cocaine was found in one such tunnel construction. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Usually is smuggled cocaine in small quantities and not through tunnels. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This shows the &quot;desperation&quot; of the drug gangs, whose traditional routing were now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA DEA in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> You would do anything to get into the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> To the arrested were no details announced, at least one was Mexican, it said. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> They face up to ten years imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Obama backed down in health policy </seg>
<seg id="2309"> After severe criticism President Obama backed out yesterday on his often-repeated, clear pledge: &quot;If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2310"> After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a termination letter, the Republican President accused in the last few days, he had deceived the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> &quot;They can keep the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> In response to the numerous media reports on the layoffs, Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices, to look on the market for a new insurance. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Most citizens could get for the same price or cheaper than forecast as a better, more comprehensive health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;You get a better deal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The Government described it as a little surprising that the five percent of the population, who have taken out insurance, would have to look to a different tariff, because her contract Care Act is not the new standards after the affordable. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;I would like to say that Americans directly: you deserve better&quot;, Sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and Commerce Committee of the House of representatives in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care Act, said that the launch of the online platform was &quot;abysmal&quot; run since October. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> &quot;I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else also&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I am determined to regain your trust. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> This phrase of a disgruntled Sebelius a seated behind her counselor at the yesterday&apos;s hearing in the House of representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican members Billy Long out of Missouri. It was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> Long Sebelius harried after more than three hours hearing reviewed the question of why the &quot;architect&quot; of the affordable care Act have not voluntarily waived on a Government-sponsored insurance to complete yourself a tariff at HealthCare.gov the now millions of Americans would sell. </seg>

<seg id="2325"> Newborn is allocated not more rigid male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Under the new law, more for such children must explain no gender parents, but can indicate &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;not set&quot; on the birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> The aim of the Act is to take the pressure of parents, so that they need make no hasty decisions on operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later: &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I stick the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> It is estimated that one comes from 2,000 children every year as a boy or a girl to the world. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;Sex differentiation disorder&quot; (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexed. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> Understanding the gender identification is always not very well developed, but most experts in the United States to guess one should gender assignment using the best available information, if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide if any - for an operation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sound like a good thing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Intersex children do pose an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but that does not apply to most children,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> You could make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait as the identity can develop. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data about how a child ever developed its gender identity, are not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> No one knows why it is happening. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It&apos;s like the secret, which is why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it is called intersex people are indistinguishable from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gendered, but due to their biological Constitution, which neither exclusively male nor female, but typically at the same time or not clearly one of defined as both. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These properties were in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structure and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> The report also gives an overview about the discrimination that intersex and transgender persons in the working life faced as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Not the sex image matching boys now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> Now it is possible, on official documents, male, female in Australia and Nepal for adults or to specify &quot;third gender&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> In June, Australian Norrie may-Welby was recognized (52) as the world&apos;s first &quot;genderless&quot; person after a court had granted lifetime maintaining of a &quot;not set&quot; gender status. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> German ID cards have a third assignment, X for intersexed, M and W in the future so the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In the neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a news story on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> 2011, dozens of French lawmakers of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The American Web site Catholic Online has also the German law opposed, stating: &quot;If dragged the world into a new State, where the gender a decision not representing sexual activity but then we turn the two other pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone baby, it would be better if a gender will assigned to babies at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;The existence of the parents is already stressful enough, without additional restrictions especially if you don&apos;t know the gender of the own child&quot;, she told the parents website. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Historically were children who both were born with male and female genitals, referred to as hermaphrodites, attractive Greek God, who had both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Ten years ago, the medicine looked at sex as something that you could wipe out and then rebuild. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> But now, the ethical foundations of an operation be doubted, after is now known, how complex is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong too, because they don&apos;t know how to feel the child is growing up with the gender assigned to them. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> &quot;Mid-20th century it was called the a, psychiatric emergency &apos;&quot;, Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If such a child was born, then called not the psychiatrists but the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia is Dr. John money of Johns Hopkins University back to the view represented the gender is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued, social and environmental initiatives - how parents raise a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as if a person consider themselves as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> But in one under the title of &quot;John/Joan&quot;-known case in 1966, his theories were controversial. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was been separated during a botched circumcision not to castrate the child remove also his testicles and then to raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not&quot;, so Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When the boy about was 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> With 38, but he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would use this model. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations to the public have appeared that are &quot;not happy with the result&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Such as when Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and believed he could do a &quot;satisfying life&quot; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> So his external organ and the testicles were 1976 surgically removed shortly after birth and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> At the age of 12 he received female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> &quot;I knew that I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> At the age of 18, he should get a Vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What he found was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilised at birth - and no one has ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD, making his body could produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After he had learned the truth, he moved again to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> The operation is becoming barren. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today, he fights for others in an organization called the interface project for intersex people as normal to be perceived. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California-based legal group advocates for informed choice, worries that the German law &quot;could encourage the stamp and Stigmatisieren&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents, quick to make decisions and the child, not set &apos; assign &apos;, she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We fear that promotes interventions. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> But still we do not know how to affect the law, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar-Mattis said, her organization supported the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults the recognition as a third gender&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender&quot;, she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> The German law involves the assignment at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> This is not a fight which should coerce young children at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> When they grow up, they can decide themselves about their body. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual differentiation disorders and supported hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law &quot;authorize&quot; parents as well as children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the target cells for testosterone receptor defect, Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Today Katie is 29 and married; She works as a researcher in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Though she is barren, but hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;The law gives parents room, which they need to make decisions not rushed&quot;, Baratz said. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> It gives them time to make different tests and to clarify things and gives them such time before they write &apos;male&apos; or &apos;female&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this way everything is alright - it pulls the child big and loves it. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents luck. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And you must not hastily make an operation that can do not more undo. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;That includes the children in the decision and eliminated they would do not right the fear that drives parents, because they are of the opinion,&quot; said they. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Ultimately the child decides the gender, which are better suited to him - and that&apos;s wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Children be enables in the situation, to make the decision himself. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellent mastered the fight </seg>
<seg id="2407"> The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway&apos;s novel &quot;The old man and the sea&quot;, Horst Janson is cut on the body. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Janson is himself an old hand in his profession, the art of acting. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> None when fishing can do something before the old man Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> So the two complement each other great. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> You&apos;d think almost the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the Fisher boy Manolo speaks, to be able to see. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> When Santiago tired bent by life on the Chair, this is real at Janson. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Next to it is the role of the old Fisher through and through a Charakterrolle which excellent masters Janson. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Janson is at long distances as the sole actor on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues, no moment are boring. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> His efforts finally to pull the fish, the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the Sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Director Jens Hasselmann can operate the old man in the boat before the fishing village. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> During the performance, he sets the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, who sings with her songs and her beautiful voice of Cuba&apos;s attitude to life. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> The four musicians playing Cuban rhythms to and are guests of the bar at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Looking for ice cream, which glows in the dark? </seg>
<seg id="2422"> A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the dark ice - using of jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Charlie Francis himself took full advantage of the fluorescent properties of sea animals and created from it a luminous delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The idea came to him, after he had read a research paper about jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists artificially to produce the glowing protein. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, which raised the pH in the protein and the light thrown. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Chris explains the ice respond to the heat in the mouth and light - the more it licks, is the brighter it. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Charlie, the ice cream company&apos;s founders &quot;lick me I&apos;m delicious&quot;, says: &quot;the product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and you get two grams for 200 pounds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> When the protein is heated by the mouth, the pH rises and lights up the ice. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it, because it has this wonderful glow on Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream I&apos;ve ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Each ball costs me about 140 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> But for that it tastes good. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Charlie&apos;s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> But his latest creation to be more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> He says: &quot;I want to develop like an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> This is in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light, caused by the ice crystals make up ice cream; but I suppose we will find a way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists </seg>

<seg id="2508"> The night was long, the music loud and the mood well, but eventually it goes home. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Only: In the bellies of the people on the front passenger and back seat hunger is noticeable. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Clearly, the occasional cocktail or champagne may be responsible! </seg>
<seg id="2511"> What obvious, as the drive to chilled to the next &quot;drive-in&quot;, to treat yourself to a little something? </seg>
<seg id="2512"> I admit, I&apos;m happy with when it comes to fast food catching up late at night or early in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> A few French fries, a coke and a burger - and then nothing like home and in bed! </seg>
<seg id="2514"> But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers making their presence felt. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> For what must be a missing that throw his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Discarded paper bags are mainly on the weekends along roadsides and in parking lots. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> &quot;Why?&quot;, I ask myself. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Are the people too stupid to take the bag home or until the next trash can? </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It is not only so, that the paper stuff blighted the landscape. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Bags have obscured even transport facilities such as guard rails and thus triggered accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Do we not think said &quot;throwaway&quot; about something but, she probably don&apos;t even know what this word actually means. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If you are in the evening more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how a rear bench can look through long nights: clothes, bottles and other trash Tower there. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Because some bags would make up more or less but also nothing – as opposed to the street, where nobody on the food remains of others want to trample. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> I see already the day come, at which the clearing away is too stupid the cities and towns - and the fast food chains need to require deposit for their bags. </seg>

<seg id="2536"> Doughs are loose instead of egg for example with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken tofu can serve this purpose. </seg>

<seg id="2540"> American road planners are looking for a money source, to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which takes place in each car&apos;s dashboard. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices, which record every kilometres and report the information to the authorities, are core of a controversial attempt by Washington and planning offices of the Federal States to revise the obsolete system for the financing of American roads. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> Suddenly, the usually rather boring field of road planning has reignited an intense debate with colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue, that the Government the small boxes to record mileage - and may also, where they went - use and can then use the information for the calculation of tax assessments. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The tea party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But while it can be agreed in Congress not on a procedure several States no longer wait. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> They are considering, as they can switch to a system over the next ten years to pay the driver per driven mile. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some with GPS monitoring of which are equipped. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> This is really a must-have for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;There is nothing that we may or may not use&quot;, said Hasan Ikhrata, Director of the Southern California Assn. of Government, is planning a recording of driven miles with all California motorists in the State from 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The manner, as we pay these taxes, will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology for this is here. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The initiative comes at a time as the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes Americans pay at the pump is broke. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> But in America much less fueled as before. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars consume less gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The State fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) is not increased for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians in high fuel prices do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> &quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> His State has equipped recently 500 cars with tachograph, with which a mileage-based payment system to be tested. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;That represents the long term appropriate alternative&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats describe it as a mileage-based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> It is not surprising that the urban Liberals idea appeals, because the tax would, for example, to engage, to influence, that will reduce congestion and greenhouse gases driving. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The California designers put on the system in the development of strategies with which the ambitious statutory objectives of the State on climate change are to be achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he saw in it the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Also the free marketers of the reason Foundation are the idea taken by travelled route pay driver. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;This is no tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, Vice President for policy at the reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> People pay for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers, who had urged the Congress in a report in 2011, to move toward mile-based billing. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would include 10,000 cars last year. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> But the majority in the House of representatives prevented the advance and reacted to represent the concerns of members from rural areas, people who have to travel often many miles on the way to work or into the city everyday. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Several States and cities nonetheless move on your own in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Oregon, which is currently 5,000 riders for the biggest experiment of the country is the most dedicated. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will pay soon the mile instead of mineral oil tax to the State. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York City is also considering one. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois tests it enshrined with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the ministries of transport of 17 States on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The concept is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada, where recently, 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical at the thought of the Government could track their every move. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; explains directed Khan, head of the strategy and results management in the Ministry of transport of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> As the test went on, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its Web site: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown monitoring devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada belongs to a series of States that now are looking for more affordable technology, with which the State can collect kilometres, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Thus, so Khan, also the public would be reassured. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Hunting for this technology, some authorities has led to a small startup company called true mileage in California. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The company is not lined up originally to assist States in the taxation of motorists. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold, where drivers on the basis of driven miles to pay in an emerging market for insurance. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> But the devices tested by her are interesting also for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, regularly be uploaded via a modem. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Huge mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon, the designers experiment to give motorists a number of choices. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> You can opt for a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee on the basis of miles driven by all the inhabitants of the State average. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Other authorities hope to be able to sell the concept of a wary public, by equipping the devices with more functions than with less. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device taxation pay can also park fees, insurance only for mileage must be paid with speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to those drivers can Dodge congestion. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> &quot;Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits provided by the system, to participate in&quot;, according to a planning document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> However, some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area who told officials, the Congress could San Francisco Bay Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> An additional one-time fee or an annual tax could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> &quot;There is no reason for an operation, if aspirin is also sufficient,&quot; explained Randy Rentschler, the Director of legislative and public affairs of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> If we do this, hundreds get millions of car drivers worried about their privacy and many other things. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Bad Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC </seg>
<seg id="2605"> The official opening ceremony for the art turf sports field despite the cold weather and rain lost nothing of significance for the city and the football club. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> All were wanted last Saturday probably a pleasant ceremony, but Peter wanted to not play with it. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> So those were looking up, which came without umbrella or not could keep such a reason. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> That was the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as some speakers. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Wet, hence the FC Chairman Albrecht was Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> His thanks was all Mayor Walter Klumpp, who have strongly dedicated to the implementation of the project, the Municipal Council, the participating companies and Association members, who are brought up. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> Here particularly Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> The sprightly pensioner moved 400 M² paving stones for the new routes. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Also the politician Karl Rombach paid tribute to this remarkable volunteer commitment. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Hubert Baier, the District Chairman of the Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning Office, which announced a donation to the youth section of the Club spoke more words of welcome for the urban Sports Committee. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Mayor Klumpp brought in memory, that recurring weather-related influences so used to the original pitch in spring and autumn, that he could not be played. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> 15 years ago, there was the first considerations to the solution of the problem, as was thought on the construction of a third place at the site of the football club or the Realschule at the Salt Lake. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> Both was cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Six years ago, thoughts came to the laying of art turf athletic fields on what General considered the ultimate solution. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Concrete plans were recorded two years ago, when FC took over the Schabelstube in lease, said a fee of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> The Council decided the acquisition of the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of EUR 560 000 in October 2012, summarized Klumpp. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The construction of 68 x 108 meter artificial turf fields took place on June 4. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> During the construction phase lasting over three months 3000 cubic metres were removed Earth which used half for the establishment of a dirt-bike track. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unknown girl hurt by gunshot out of car </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Unknown have injured a twelve in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The perpetrators had probably fired with an air pressure gun on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> This was announced by the police in Castle. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The girl had been easily breached on the left calf. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> Rescue workers brought the girl to the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> The shot came from a small car that was passed to a group of six children and had stopped suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> Witnesses saw two people in the car sitting. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> A wheel broke. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Then they drove away. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> The criminal police are investigating, it said on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Snowden is ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany on US monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. secret service, said he was ready to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander give no answers about their activities. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> On Thursday, the German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia, where it has received asylum, to discuss the statement in Germany with him. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday by Ströbele media in Berlin, he writes: &quot;even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my Government still treated a dissenting opinion as a betrayal and attempts to criminalize political speech with subpoena in which no defense is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2639"> To tell the truth, but is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> In the letter, Snowden writes, he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to drop the charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> The charges levied by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of Government property. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told time online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk with German representatives then we find ways to make this possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by the claims, the NSA heard the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the secret service, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, &quot;without compromising him and to ruin relations with the United States&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> He was accompanied during his visit to Russia by two German journalists. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Ströbele said that according to the law of the former NSA employee Snowden not could return to Russia, when he was leaving the country. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> When Snowden in Germany say he needed an assurance that he was &quot;safe&quot;, so the honourable Member. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed would be a &quot;serious and continuous&quot; campaign of persecution, have expelled him from his homeland. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> He was however affected by the worldwide reaction to &quot;my Act of political expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians - even in the United States - have revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit at the public referred to. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation the German authorities, &quot;If the difficulties related to the humanitarian situation have been resolved&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Thousands of people gathered in the Centre of Maputo, under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first President of Mozambique, to sing in a rare public demonstration of peace calls. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;Again, we want peace, we want stability&quot;, Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company said. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Fearing for the future of the country, she has exchanged their business attire for a T-Shirt with the words &quot;We demand security&quot; in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on the independence square in the capital Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between forces of the Government and RENAMO, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the South African apartheid Government in an effort to destabilize the country&apos;s independent Government. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> She became an opposition party after the peace treaty of 1992. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Analysts consider it unlikely that the country again fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> For the fast-growing economy the stakes are high, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the North West could investments of over $ 50 billion by companies such as Rio Tinto over the next years, Vale from Brazil, ENI of Italy and Anadarko of the United States in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The ruling FRELIMO party, since 1975 the dominant force, and RENAMO give each other the blame for the tensions. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> RENAMO claims the Government provoked the latest clashes, by she had attacked their members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The assault on the former rebels escalated the leader of the group, as to kill Government troops RENAMO bases of attacked and attempted, Afonso Dhlakama, said Renamos spokesman told the financial times. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The Government blames RENAMO for the clashes and accused the Organization of assaulting soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday, Dhlakama to consider themselves as &quot;Losers&quot; who &quot;wants to use all of his remaining powers, to prove that he can impose his decisions to the Government&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Both FRELIMO and RENAMO emphasize that they want to avoid a war. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> But the concerns have increased since the Mazanga was quoted as saying, RENAMO quit the peace agreement of 1992. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> Compared with the FT, he explained that he meant that FRELIMO will no longer respect the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> &quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Earlier talks between the political parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that were fuelled by a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) heads collide,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> None of them is good at negotiating and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> RENAMO, pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated she will boycott the elections in November. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the Government. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Renamos electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party which will improve founded Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably in the elections by a former RENAMO member. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Mazanga claimed that Guebuza - pending his resignation when his second term ends next year - use of the democracy of the country would destroy. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> &quot;He wants no multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he wants no peace, because he wants to give up the Presidency&quot;, as Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It is unclear what RENAMO capacity has, but it has taken restlessness-making attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connections. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The most fighting took place in the province of Sofala, lies some hundred kilometers north of Maputo, the but Beira port, mining companies like Rio Tinto is located in and Vale to the export of coal use. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> In June, Rio interrupted for a month use of the railway, after RENAMO had announced an attack on the route. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Mazanga restrained answered the question whether RENAMO will repeat that threat. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> Mazanga said RENAMO wanted to &quot;the international community warn that things in Mozambique are not good&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> The instability was the frustration with the Government still increased, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already due to corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;People think that the Government and the President for the future of the country and he should be the one who will find solutions to the problems,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Omar sultans, a protester, said people wanted just stability. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;No interested in RENAMO and FRELIMO, they want only back peace and usable roads,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2873"> President Barack Obama&apos;s closest advisers have considered in secret, Vice President Joe Biden campaign 2012 by Hillary Clinton to replace, so the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The revelation is the most surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the election of 2012, &quot;double down: game change 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> A copy of the forthcoming book is the times and she reported on Thursday evening that the top Advisor to the President &quot;extensive group meetings and surveys end of 2011&quot; had carried out, to find out whether it is better look for Obama&apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election when he drop Biden. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the times, the book traces thoroughly the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, notably of the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers to replace the former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Only a half-dozen of the closest advisors of the President - including Daley, the former Campaign Manager for Obama, Jim Messina, and the former Senior Adviser of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> In &quot;Double Down&quot;, it is claimed, Daley had been at the forefront of the effort, despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; to replace Biden, before it eventually decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton&apos;s candidacy &quot;would not significantly improve the chances of Obama &apos;s&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> With Martin, Daley confirmed in an interview that the Government actually thought about, to replace Biden with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> &quot;I said a number of things you should take into consideration, and that was one of them,&quot; Daley told the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> One has to call in memory, that the President had at that time terrible poll numbers, so we thought: &quot;For God&apos;s sake, what we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> While Daley described the investigation as &quot;diligence&quot;, Martin compared to Anderson Cooper of CNN said that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expense had been operated, to find out whether such a move pay in terms of the polls. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> &quot;In campaigns not so much money on polls and focus groups will be issued, if not seriously thinking about something&quot;, said Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team through an exchange of thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Martin told CNN, he asked Daley if his former boss about the potential change was mishandling. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Although Daley stated that he does not believe that the President of the possible change &quot;was aware&quot;, the former Chief of staff admitted it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew it. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; give no definitive answer to the question whether the political investigation of Obama&apos;s desk would have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously think Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether you should drop Biden in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> &quot;Possible&quot;, said Martin. </seg>

<seg id="2893"> The Gemeindesäckl in herdwangen Saeed is well stocked and debt no longer knows the management since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Also the financial year 2012 can be recorded in this sense as a complete success. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> This was highlighted during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Andrea Rothmund explained, the operating budget with approximately 7.6 million euros fell out over a million higher than planned. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Also the surplus of the administrative budget was around a million euros on the approach with approximately 1.8 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Thanks to the surplus was mainly higher tax revenues and the community share of the income tax. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Also the capital budget was again significantly above planned levels. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros he was 2.5 million euros last year. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;This is essentially at the higher feeder from the administrative budget, so Raj.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Because in the financial year 2012 less investment than planned have been made, higher was also the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> Overall, the general reserve to EUR 2.1 million to a total 4.9 million euros could be increased. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Raj and her team for their good work. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> Gallo praised &quot;not easily shaken as a work from the sleeve&quot;, with views of the financial statements. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> He and the Councillors visibly pleased with the good figures. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> It may sound paradoxical, but these good numbers could come soon, very costly for citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> By good financial situation, the municipality in the past could dispense with high rates. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> This in turn grants were reduced but according to Gallo often from the country. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> There are prerequisites for these grants various balancing sticks out. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Among other things, the cities and municipalities, applying for grants, must present specific rates. </seg>

<seg id="2923"> Obama&apos;s memoir about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> I&apos;m currently reading a terribly sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> It is a book from which I thought it would cheer me up during the sombre second year of studying medicine and give me hope. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (courage to win) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama&apos;s presidential campaign in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> When I am finished the evening with my patient records and go to bed, then the book leads me back at a time when politics inspired millions and could take your breath away for a talk. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> The election was a landslide victory and newscaster stopped to make the historical significance of this hour before the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> My classmates were weeping with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find. </seg>

<seg id="2932"> As at 2008, Obama joined in the Office, he had ratings of 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> And then, I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> On the present a rude awakening is to switch back, as if one is torn from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be, a sad reminder of missed opportunities a vague memory. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Over the years, since I first made my voice, something has changed in fact. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But it&apos;s nothing that I could have imagined me easy. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has achieved, by the passage of the affordable care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> Also I believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just a few to mention. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> But I&apos;ve won numerous times the Obama administration&apos;s hostility towards colleagues and acquaintances, I&apos;m arrived with my explanations at the end. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I have reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows eavesdropping on foreign heads of State, or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It can not explain why the national security agency to collect information about the private lives of Americans and the State misconduct disclose why punished the whistleblower. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor therefore be bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It justifies not the results of a report in which it says the efforts of the White House to the immobilization of the media to be the &quot;most aggressive&quot;... Since the Nixon administration. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And jüngstens it can excuse not an inability, to design a simple website care act in more than three years since the adoption of the affordable. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I don&apos;t know if it is what I would have expected. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> I would have to understand with 18, that Government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding it. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Obviously members is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre dominate public discussion. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> But when I look at the examples above, they seem largely by the Government to be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> And that bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I got re-elected 2012 Obama, not because I was excited about his candidacy. </seg>
