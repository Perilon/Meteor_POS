<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to hinder Obama&apos;s reelection </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, the Brennan Centre considers this a myth and says that electoral fraud is less prevalent in the United States that the number of people who die because of the fall of lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, the lawyers Republicans have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In that sense, these measures will undermine the american democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike in Canada, the United States, are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And in the same vein, a majority of Americans enacted by governments, from 2009, new laws that hamper the process of registration or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 675 new republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Accordingly, during the year 2011 were introduced 180 projects law that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws that require voters to present an identity card with a photograph, and a test of american citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, refuting the right to register as a voter on the day of the ballot and removes their right to vote to people with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 election, no american state required voters to present an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The state of Indiana was the first to demand it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the law in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, the republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the american people do not have an identity document universal, as the card of social security. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the american people, that is to say, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity card with a photograph issued by a government agency in your state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 without an identity document with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, often, the identity document required costs more than $100. </seg>
<seg id="22"> With the new restrictions, which disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 per year, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And there are still more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students in many states, voters who vote more to democratic candidates, cannot use the identity card with a photograph issued by his institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, those same states allow members of clubs fishing or hunting parties tend to vote for Republicans to use documents issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 no rule requiring proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state with such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to show that they are american citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are, clearly, limiting the hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It appears that two out of three hispanic voters support the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On the other hand, republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws abolishing the registration of voters on the same day of the ballot in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the general elections of 2004, the campaigns of registering voters contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures taken since 2009, the rate of registering new voters fall in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the period of vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were african-Americans, while recent not represented more than 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the case of Hispanics was exactly the same. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These represent no more than 11% of the electorate, which equates to a 24% of the people who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, representing a 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of the people who vote in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the congressional Democrats and their supporters have been fervently opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In this sense, the governors, Democrats have blocked several bills. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The prosecutor of the United States intervened to suspend laws more controversial. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was, in part, to limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, it is undeniable that new rules adopted complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics denounce Democrats the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that these are aimed at influencing the outcome of 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report from the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measures would undermine the american democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: is going to test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In effect, the PSA test is sometimes wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides to make unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is a good enough reason to hesitate to men, already reluctant, should be made on whether or not the tests of detection. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test is going or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We sought advice from two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies in the United States was detected a great rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make strong recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> For its part, the european study showed some difference in mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study, a follow-up to 12 years, showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of suffering from cancer if it has not done the test screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend tests from the age of 50, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The origin of african-american men have a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are lax. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It is absolutely necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not damage the long-term life, in which case you should opt for a more active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who were detected cancer are not treated, said cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to her life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, they suggest an active monitoring of the disease, and if this progresses, we offer a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Fix increasingly often precise criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I would recommend that you do the test in any case. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to talk with your doctor to determine whether it should be the test or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urología, a tool that allows us to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (for the moment only in English, but will provide translations shortly) at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risk from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We estimate that if everyone ate well and moving enough, it could prevent a 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> “If anyone smoke, that rate will rise at least 50 per cent”, says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian society against cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Instead, we assess that around 10% of cancers are inherited. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many others remain totally inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the canadian society against the cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is linked with 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Enormous damage to people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> “Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer was reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Increase the risks of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> “Research shows that the practice of regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,” added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The body also recommends limiting consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large quantities, climb the risks of developing colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The deli counter products should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat for its smoky, drying or salazón can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> “Can harm the body&apos;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, scientists have studied the links between vitamin complex and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> However, by the time their investigations are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> The SCC Segú, studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one of them found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what they observed was, rather, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on the cancer has not been able to determine with clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> On the other hand, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each with their doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> “Do the test screening does not cause cancer.” </seg>
<seg id="104"> The bosón Higgs in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosón likely provoked consternation last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It believes that this bosón is engaged in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physical is not entirely clear who is Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that is much like the bosón Higgs predicted by the standard model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data revealed this week in a major conference of physical place in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is still missing, though more data to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, since the chances of tripping few seem to see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in the wider world, a law and widespread inescapable that involves two things that may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There is no way to violate that standard and not try to do too much, because it will end up getting hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although the physical particles is a very complex world, has shown that it is a law of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same state “quantum”; a “state” that consists basically of some of its characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> The particles physicists classified into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> On the one hand we are good citizens called fermiones, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And on the other are the dirty bosones, a bunch of anarchists that has no respect for nothing, or at least not by this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website the Particle Adventure laboratory Berkeley, which, incidentally, is extraordinary, bosones were divided into two groups: the landlords, not talking here, and “particles”, for which the great forces of nature and spread with which the bosón Higgs would somehow kindred. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosones would highlight here, are not exotic gruesome creatures that might believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this story, it is thanks to an extraordinarily bosón banal: fotón or “particle of light” that acts as a “messenger” of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when a particle with a burden power accelerates or changes direction, “time” the magnetic field at that precise environment; a bit like when we launched a stone into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> In this “mess” born electro (a wavelength of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a fotón; that is to say, one of the “bosones bearers of force.” </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the bosón Higgs, with the difference that this is another area, the Higgs field, which needs to be “messy” for this bosón appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the magnetic field to activate it. we need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a chunky rock could slip on the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Why we need a huge particle accelerator at the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of girth!) to reach such levels of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the magnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the magnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, they do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will not be sustained for ever himself glued to the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: that they do have a mass, while the rest (how fotón, incidentally), do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what “can bring all of these investigations?” asks Mrs Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and, moreover, that physicists escrutinen differences between the observations and predictions of MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For their part, many wish fervently that they are, because the slightest difference could open a door to a “new physics” to tape some holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it proposes no explanation whatsoever concerning the seriousness (ups!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (another ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But we found no such differences in the CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of these investigations in our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe we are wrong to say that will not have any. </seg>
<seg id="138"> To see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories not suspected in the revolution to its work force. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and he produced the first laser continued (the first were pulsados) in 1962, initially the laser was more well regarded as a “laboratory apparatus.” </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine … </seg>
<seg id="142"> And furthermore, applications can proceed across the orchestration that surrounds the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a captador light in 1969 in the course of their research in the field of optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Despite that was not in his original intention, this captador serves now “eye” for all devices, digital world, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> That is not to say, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know … </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care: the best way to die … &amp;pipe; Le Devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> In his committee Morir in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should recommence soon as it prepares a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, within this dominance crucial, there is still much to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to see closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer that was destroying had been given a reprieve of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> “I had given five years of life, but I have just seven,” states a fact, lie, lie in bed in the centre of palliative care-Victor Gadbois of Beloeil, reached the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> “But it is always a shock, cannot be ready for this,” continues. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease has caused havoc: a huge weakness which prevents him from only go to the toilet and even eat alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting before a tempting lunch resigned, agreed to help him eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, even to smile, to speak with the unknown to him, bring him care medicines and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> “My greatest wish is that I heal diarrhea, it is humiliating,” confesses. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> “In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes pis rose,” Pierre tells Brodeur, psychologist at the centre-Victor Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Return to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> “That depends on the ability of the person to accept this regression,” notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the view of the majority of the people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place in the heart of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> All patients entering the heart of palliative care-Victor Gadbois suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Have a prognosis of life more than three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer offering care “curative.” </seg>
<seg id="168"> The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years, death is “conscious and drowned.” </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has led him to discover to their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> “I have good children”, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> “Yes, I still find most wishes in this life,” he says, before accepting that it puts a mascarilla to help them breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And waiting in the coming days, a final visit to his son, who lives in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps feed. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Palliative care are to be given when there is nothing we can do more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To help that his death is more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec have a bed palliative care for each 11.7 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Very little, because we know that we all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the centre. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether at the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The moribund will offer shenanigans of mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> To diabetics will no longer controls its rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Death is part of the everyday. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening I serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son ended the beer at the feet of late. </seg>
<seg id="185"> “Ayudamos both patients and their loved ones,” describes Nathalie Savard, director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In the centre-Victor Gadbois days pass without ever be equal. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Beside a man of 94 years savoring his last meeting family in the courtyard, well placed between their almohadas while all drink to his health, a young 36 years dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> “For the last six months, there are always three to five beds are occupied by people under the age of 45 years suffering from cancer,” worries Dr Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the centre-Victor Gadboisarrivent comes home and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% of Canadians simply has no access to palliative care, that is to say, the care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal stages of his life, is at home in the hospital or a care centre. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several bodies, such as the centre-Victor Gadbois and society of palliative care home of Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this large gap in health care of Quebec that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law which regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent and to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> “Recently”, states, “I saw a patient pass 14 days in emergencies without suffering great pain that it has done what was necessary to relieve this. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive appropriate care.” </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the final day, despite the worst forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already low when left a tiring chemotherapy treatment. </seg>
<seg id="200"> “When I told my oncóloga who wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that gave it a pity that I fight,” describes. </seg>
<seg id="201"> “However, she was told that there was nothing more to do!” </seg>
<seg id="202"> There are no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request die by their carers that they have handled their demands once it has eased their pain thanks to a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it has to be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in regard to the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatments against the pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, whether sporadically or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the disease is relieved not to have the prospect of having that palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.” </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean “like euthanasia,” but “I want to defuse.” </seg>
<seg id="211"> The completion of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism research institutes of Health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate scandals of great breadth in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists from the italian mafia count, day after day, you know what a formidable “system”, which includes the construction industry officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An “industry” that was too expensive to taxpayers in Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> “It is curious how the system is pulveriza once hunted to the big media,” Jacques ironiza Duchesneau in Quebec, MEP and former chief of police in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to contracts of roads in Quebec, the liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than delaying. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The report “Duchesneau” established a direct link between the industry, the illegal funding of parties and corruption among officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> “Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Transport Ministry would have saved $1 billion in contracts”, containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportionate share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau Commission “has already made two mayors,” adds, while hoping to come to “show the ploys existing behind individuals.” </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies to his team of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> This unit also works on police “defined Marteau,” which, since 2009, have made the “cartel” of the sewers of Montreal moderates to inflate contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> These last few weeks, the unit has the registration number of the allegations of fraud and corruption charges against municipal as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has now resigned from his position of mayor of Laval, Quebec City third. </seg>
<seg id="225"> There is a suspicion that has been nicked repeated bribes in return for contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Has been formally charged engineers of the road network of Montreal and entrepreneurs of italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has caused shock to the Commission to explain the mechanics of the “system” of obtaining public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He paid over three years, a 3% of the value of the contracts awarded in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia, which transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> M. Zambito dished out money left, right and centre during the years 2000, giving more than 88 CAD ($68 million) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He admitted, too, having organised a fundraising illegal for ex-Deputy Prime Minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The inflation in the cost of sewer contracts </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero public works, explained it well before the Committee: in ten years received gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, parties of hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector, for a total of $736.000, all in exchange for contracts sewerage whose inflated costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road network have admitted that received money by inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in false extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the Party&apos;s mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a budget parallel and filled their coffers of dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected political Montreal that sounding the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island since 2010, was opposed to the sale of ground Municipal acquired for $5 million and resold by 1.6 million developers in the housing boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of the money for election campaigns was dirty money </seg>
<seg id="240"> The research that will eventually take place, it ensures that he is “a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.” </seg>
<seg id="241"> And it adds that “the process is painful, but positive.” </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are cleaning wounds but would need a research unit clean in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices are not repeated. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, says that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but is especially concerned about the role of the “elected politicians aware of the ploy”. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Judging by 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironiza: “I have said that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality.” </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government proposes to limit quebequés $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, “while not strictly the election expenses, dirty money in politics.” </seg>
<seg id="248"> Calls for a complete overhaul of the system of awarding contracts and financing parties: “we cannot fall lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, allow us to rebuild the home with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws”. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laughed to look in the mirror. </seg>
<seg id="250"> “PSG is not the FC Barcelona!” </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season has acquired a new entity with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How to explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> Could be explained by a seizure of individual conscience, but also for the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> They have got great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> To go from day to day, to his side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also it has given me much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> And these elements prompts me to daily to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> In a party that is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not acaloro. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early in the centre of preformación INF Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, always have progressed in leaps and bounds. </seg>
<seg id="262"> He is going to get the benefit of competition is recruited by Carlo Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruited this summer are accustomed to contest matches very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> That makes a player as I am keen to fight and give it everything. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot on my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by an aide as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Does Ancelotti is the man who needed the team? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technical. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, there is no equal in League 1 and is among the best european coaches. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that there will be other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a conversation with him very comforting. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just emerged from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the league, Lyon 1 has removed the post of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But still in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth end with style. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We are going to try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have much to say in response to many and very good european teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to start, finishing the first of our League against Porto to qualify for the final round of elimination. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can become a big european club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> Already has the budget … </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major european club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Economically, the PSG is delivered to their means for that project materializes. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not winning the Cup in League 1, like last season, would be a huge failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a major disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we are going to invest all our efforts in bringing this title of champions. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season did not get far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we have been a disappointment, because we had the ideal conditions to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We had a strong season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions … </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, had quite a season best. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year I think it will be good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that means waiting more than PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal to expect a lot from us if you consider what has been invested in the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accepted completely. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, which are still finding things that blame is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what most people expected. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 every week. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to put in place a draft game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built in time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for final elimination, and they also have invested a great deal of time! </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested, you imaginaríamos with 15 points ahead of time. </seg>
<seg id="315"> That would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship in France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been “driven” by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> That shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG is entirely dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Better to say that we have a “Zlatandependencia.” </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and burying many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Has been to show that is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And has shown in all the teams in the past that he is a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group that we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> And he also respects the men which has around her. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This prompts others to increase their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How has lived the Euro 2012 Championship with France&apos;s team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> It has been a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was very excited to participate in this tournament. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury I prevented accumulate game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there and left strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Achievement today play good matches in the selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is what I expected from my baptism with the “bleus”. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why today we have exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What vision are the first month of Didier Deschamps is at the forefront of the “bleus”? </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is getting results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> They are well-placed in the group of classification for the world. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The selection is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As was the case of Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc achieved its goal of clasificarnos for the tournament. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the selection to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The standoff (1-1) on 16 October in Spain helped lay the foundations? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each struggled for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, had not experienced a similar game throughout my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Contrary to the current currency transactions, based on central banks, identified the burdens and transaction processing between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at once a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc., and a change in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equals. </seg>
<seg id="353"> There have been nearly 200 transactions through 15,000 computer network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> And nearly a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of 30 ($23 million) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today to approximately ten dollars (contributions are censan page bitcoincharts. com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Is nothing impressive when compared with the global changes in real currency or in financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in him in a report on virtual coins issued in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It described the bitcoin virtual currency as the “most successful”, “that competes with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.” </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as the “credit”, used to move in a vídeojuego and that you can win by playing or you can buy (and even sometimes swap). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook also developed this type of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But a central authority in any exchange controls and these changes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both trustees of books, auditors, issuers of currency and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is really between two directions in the form of electronic mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> A user may choose a different direction for each payment, thereby guaranteeing the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A range of information related to this transaction was signed electronically through a system of encryption key to double. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins appear in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key milestone is to write this new compromise in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This depends on the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding that line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> This is a phase of chopping up of file, namely, transforming a large file in a digital footprint shorter and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers “caught” the new transaction and add a number before “chop up” the joint. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint more zeros (initially). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once that is this number, the other nodes tested easily which is good. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any changes would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to commit a fraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network just accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be an orphan, since both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer that resolves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until cienmillonésimo, which leaves a large margin. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of this challenge is also reveals every increase in the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network already has its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have been stealing bitcoins in deposit. </seg>
<seg id="383"> “The ruling does not affect used the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, which has just launched Paymium payment, a company that uses real currency Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB has in mind and the possibilities of blanquo money thanks to this service anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash presents the same defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Players of weight as Wikipedia reject payments of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the platform Wordpress, accept. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, discussed the book accounting and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins not circulating. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, it launched the “discount giants.” </seg>
<seg id="390"> “It changed $30,000,” Jon regocija Jörgen, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, author of a book on teaching this currency, believes in the potential of this technology and in the web of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile without contact, but used to validate the Bitcoin transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier also manages its identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or softwares. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They just need to supply a direction that a phone can “recognize” photographed and precise, Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of review systems for hierarchical systems more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> “He needs a time for Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 could be a change,” predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> On the other hand, in its report the ECB provides revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event of this currency success. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should leave at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army takes possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have punished especially Afghan peasants who have considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban have foreign extremists and old heads refugees in Pakistan, but often with peasants who reject the army&apos;s presence abroad, as in the times of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if their causes are joining the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerados, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they no longer will be when westerners are more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of french troops based in Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the hills of almendros thanks to credit french, was made to order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since his breakthrough irresistible between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then vacuum and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of infighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Taking control of the country had been perceived as a kind of release, the return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of its farmers overtaken by the organisation al-Qaeda, but their situation is not better today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The old mujahedin, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main figures of the anti-soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Have become speculators, gaining government land to resell as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the pair of massive american outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Are discredited; the majority of them have not fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, as will those who have managed to take advantage of the american generosity: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are weary of war and their ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have lived through the modern world during its exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> With around 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul account now with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> We work for those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties nor the corruption of leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opposition, are avid mobile phone. tv and its folletines Turks that present a modern world has big admirers around the country. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Is regarded as legitimate authorities who want to lead the country? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-soviet fight concerns already to reconstitute the militias provincial, fleeing the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain image of decentralisation in western nations, however, the United States wanted to transform into a centralised state with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which has been in place since the 1964 constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly with elections due in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, the country relies on foreign aid since the 1950s or even before. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has restored its services, has not settled any dam have not been repaired the irrigation systems. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported, and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined after 30 years of war, have been necessary governmental control. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Spread the rumour that Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> And that did more to increase the feeling of that Westerners were there to seize them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to extract the mineral iron or copper on the ground and no means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining operation. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese already have almost abandoned the Aynak copper mines of the month, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) excaven immense site búdico and remain there as employers&apos; s most important province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the country largely dependent on imports and exports, restore their normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> French troops left on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: girls schools, schools for children, a french department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the areas of military, legal, health and agricultural and support to the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, with the aim of trying to “win hearts and minds” and make the impossible task of making aid and offensive action tally, a service of actions “civilian and military” Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, and he brought back through a small French NGO work of collective interest and rehabilitation agricultural in dozens of towns in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These work, tempting pockets of obtaining local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we remember as after two billion in military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A rather modest budget will contribute to improving the living conditions of the local, very hard in these valleys often situated over 2,000 meters. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy received dozens of requests written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To release the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, would be required to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and that come directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution after a struggle in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> Is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote his final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Only a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> And almost two years that Egypt uses a provisional text, changed several times, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has not done more to increase the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For their opponents, the President is persisting in his delirium “autocratic” and continues “betraying his word” and “trampling on the right.” </seg>
<seg id="459"> By their supporters, ensures that this is a measure to end more quickly with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the next 15 days should organise a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time that compels brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the president, this is also a way to regain a popular legitimacy and democratic while the controversial wreaking havoc across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote in their favour, as stated in an interview with the american magazine Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the egyptian people: “my vote or text or maintain the full powers”, which supposedly powers will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, islamist in its large majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most liberals did not attend the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their points of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, members substitutes, in a hurry. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> As expected, the articles have been voted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies hours has been practically expressed in prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to believe that the clock constituent was ill. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which yesterday evening was still being voted, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Article 2, under the spotlight, remains finally identical to the 1971 constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.” </seg>

<seg id="586"> “Large and powerful” you take to Moscow: immigrants save for language </seg>
<seg id="587"> While MPS and human rights campaigners argue about the consequences that would bring the law on compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country merchants trading certificates “false” </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers arriving in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Mostly they are citizens of countries of Central Asia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Its sole purpose is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Since 1 December enters into force a law according to which each immigrant labour to carry out an examination to check their knowledge of the russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention of working in the sector in the provision of services, institutions of community services, domestic services and retail trade. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, as promised in the service of federal immigration reviews will become compulsory for all immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="594"> In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the language, if not also the of russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> The knowledge of language is to confirm even to receive and renew the work permits. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The exception are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> They will not be subject to this law people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Utility, doom and defending the rights </seg>
<seg id="599"> The network of centres examiners work sponsored by the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of the peoples, State University of Moscow, St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher learning Russian. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Immigrants will be able to submit evidence in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 facilities of this type. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Service of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, often put this question to the press: what will this actually? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What changes will the mandatory language proficiency, for both the Russians and for the immigrants themselves? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First, meet representatives of the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people who suffer from “slave labour”. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant labour, explains Victor Sebelev, Head of the representation of service federal immigration of Russia in Tajikistan. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Defending their rights must begin before his departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a selection system organised will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language and pass the medical supervision. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of language, says Sebelev, future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people, under the pretext of helping him get a “viajecito paid” an eerie and close covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We received a number of complaints from our immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="611"> “In their homeland they promise one thing, but to reach are deceived, are deprived of their passports, not pay them wages promised”, confirms the Chief Directorate of labour migration of the immigration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> No, enoje jefecito! </seg>
<seg id="613"> In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics that wish to work in Russia recognise that not only do not know the language of the country to go, but in their own language write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not their fault but their own misfortune: Few turkmen people, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> This is due to their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention vestirlos calzarlos pence extra, and what is needed for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> To reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if you do not know the language, recognise them. </seg>
<seg id="618"> “You feel humiliated and inferior.” </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, when it comes to the language law, rights defenders point to an important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If they do not have this status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still living illegally in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> “Welcome to strangers or banned step” </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors say that receive the official status in our country is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The cause is the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, the legalization costs money: twelve thousand sixteen thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> However, a false registration can be done quickly and only 500 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Employees of the russian police know that usually carry false documents, are not registered and there are cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> “We asked for 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea,” commented to journalists the citizens of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
<seg id="630"> “We will not be miserly, buying a painting” </seg>
<seg id="631"> The first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it became clear that not only documents the registration of immigrants can be fake. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several “fake certificates” knowledge of language have already been seized by federal immigration officials of the service. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Forged papers had been printed in color printer standard. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, arrived at the hands of new owners not as a gift: each immigrant queriéndose to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure of examination, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption “diplomas” are not able to buy converge, government officials and rights advocates. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Until now, the authorities can promise to migrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the test the first time more time to study the basic language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, those immigrants who do not speak Russian are to be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Interior Ministry does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade </seg>
<seg id="640"> The percentage of crimes committed with weapons registered is fairly small </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Interior Ministry intends to implement the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the government&apos;s reaction to the recent incidents: tighten gunfire during celebrations of weddings in which, fortunately, no one was hurt, and the massacre started by the lawyer Moscow Dimitri Vinográdov grit, in which seven people died. </seg>
<seg id="643"> The police want to prohibit the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raising the minimum age for taking licence to bear arms, of 18 to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised reforms in the law on weapons possession will be carried to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem using the “hardline policy.” </seg>
<seg id="646"> The network has appeared in an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organisations of marksmen, demand from such measures “thoroughly senseless.” </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of weapons registered is minimal, told the news service BBC Russian lawyer criminalista Vasiliy Lésnikov. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 were made 142 crimes involving the use of firearms registered in the internal organs, compared to total 1168 crimes recorded for this same period. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the area of weapons for civil use will not be an inconvenience for the offender to turn to the black market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, in his words, in Moscow can find any weapon at low prices. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry says that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons are under control. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: from factories until official </seg>

<seg id="662"> “There are versions demonstrated that some of the fires were started deliberately to cover the lack,” says a exmilitar. </seg>
<seg id="663"> According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their bit. </seg>
<seg id="664"> “We now have proliferated private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons stealthily to the black market, including Moscow,” says the expert. </seg>

<seg id="722"> Go on strike, employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Up to a quarter of american teenagers find their early work as cashiers in “McDonald&apos;s” </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, the United States has launched a wave of protests against low wages paid in the Corporation&apos;s Walmart supermarkets and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains, such as “McDonald&apos;s”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell,” “Wendy&apos;s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken.” </seg>
<seg id="725"> For now, nobody dares to say whether or not he will arrive this wave to nine points, or if it meant losing amansarse forces and in its early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protest actions have the support of unions and a number of NGOS left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase of modest salaries earned by employees of Walmart and the system of fast food, the aim of the organisers of the protests is the creation of workers&apos; unions in these companies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Does Forty-six cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The action started last week, after the day of action, the so-called “Black Viernes.” that day, in the United States the coomenzaba orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and sometimes that was accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some workers Corporation Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, they left their jobs and formed picket protest together with the unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are directed at people of modest incomes and moderates. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from nappies, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, until aspiradores, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the major supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many poorly paid workers of Walmart, buy only at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and the mix of products made from Walmart, one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because little pays its workers. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of opinion or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> This “Viernes Black” participants in the demonstration called for increased wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the company $3.2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is approximately 1.1% more than it spent on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will be only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In a year they spend a ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more than what is spent now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart say satisfied that the protest took place in only nine states and that there was no loss to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The “Black Friday” continued in its stores from 8 p. m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, their tills performed the “Viernes Black” almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of left-wing Huffington Post, who left his job “less than five” employees of Walmart, and that the protest had been nothing more than “another trick public relations”, organised by the union workers. </seg>
<seg id="748"> “Free cash!” </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests continued this week in New York, in which targets were not exactly large stores Walmart (which in this progressive city would not have appreciated, and why now there are none), but the “McDonald&apos;s and other restaurants cheap.” </seg>
<seg id="750"> “McDonald&apos;s says that sells billions of portions, and even then you attach the sickness and don&apos;t pay for your honest! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, according to the federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody earns less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of teenagers Americans through the McDonald&apos;s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although still living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly bump in some interviews with McDonald&apos;s workers who complain that they live on this salary, and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if they do not know how to eat. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday in the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cleaners and cooks fast food are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, or that it will double its current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> Also demanded that fast food is believe workers&apos; unions. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The law prohibits the US administration to prevent this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, rarely the administration makes life easier. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions covering the sector food rápid. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the biggest is the excessive staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordantes </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place the same day other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald&apos;s near Times Square, which involved several local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the council of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald&apos;s says it is selling billions of portions, and then even teaches you a hospital or you paid for your work honest.” </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other prominent Democrats from New York, for example, the candidate for mayor of the city of Bill Blasio, who said that “we must support the sector workers fast food to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity that deserves every neoyorkino.” </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described by the New York Times newspaper, this has been the biggest demonstration of its kind in the history of american fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But she participated in only a few hundred people, not even all of them were employed in the service of fast food, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether this will spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> “For now, trick the brain is not easy” </seg>
<seg id="774"> The issue of heightened reality, so popular among fans to modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Earlier this summer, in his annual conference Google showed a model in movement and then, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted a request to reclaim the relevant patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3d technology in the laboratory of Microsoft in Cambridge, Sharamom Izadi, illuminating for scientists of that company, the glasses belonged to a stage last. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They lured the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> We spend-to-computer interaction person, but also trying to extend the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> By now the humanity in its mass has remained trapped in the stage of work with pixels on the screen flat, sometimes turn the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, because all they are interested in control by gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What the future holds? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite that Kinect has led the interaction at the physical level, much of this still happens in a flat screen, sometimes in 3d. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the exit is still not very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change this, working on 3d visualization systems really, based, different technologies, including design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Must be ridding the world of computing to ours, the physical, do more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the area that surrounds it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a way more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Firstly, to hell with these fools helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about the control voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A detail very popular, but does not believe that estimate? </seg>
<seg id="793"> Clear-that can be seen as a panacea, remains open to resolve the issue of privacy, because it is not always wants others to learn about our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own field. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we believe in signs, but not in loose movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In addition, the gestures were not captured by the House of the device, but by a band that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For now is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, in general, the future is for a combined rate of control, for example of gesture and voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How is that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> For example, how can I ask you passed this tin of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You speak and the show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I only speak. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognise. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Or do you want to be, forcing users to adapt to what it can or cannot do in this moment the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Not necessarily, but it is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately gauge the reactions of the person. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These may, for example, be laser sensors, which already provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have cameras modern? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do you lack resolution, depth or something more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapíxeles at the speed of 1,000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the issue is not the megapíxeles, but in the quality of the parent and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work for designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> So, we need to remember not only the resolution axes X and Y, but also in Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also important is the speed, the number of pictures per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The human movements are very dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for those gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory in Redmond, made contact with a sensor retardation adjustable processing of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors are produced in series closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how this affects the man-machine interaction. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be very useful for my work equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact to the tables for a second more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> The Kinect-now has three “houses”, one of which is the issuer of infrared rays and the second recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third chamber is actually a simple sensor in the standard visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem … </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the requisite amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be good to create a flexible similar to Kinect, play with the curvature of location of cameras and see how this would help determinr position three-dimensional. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - From what I remember, unlike Microsoft, Google, has not submitted their glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not believe that, from the point of view of the daily use of technologies of heightened reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, all the while maintaining high in a smart phone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think that the best option would be a heightened reality “transmutable” when, on the basis of a platform for cloud, you could go from the glasses, the smart phone </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (things private only you can see them), but also its weakness: a heightened reality based on glasses will not allow it to work on virtual objects along with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holográficos virtual objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film “Iron Man”, but also for any mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no answer táctil! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers prepares his group to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In my conferences often say that the reality is heightened the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I believe that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second-hand as anchor for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> Let Registra tact perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really aimed at bringing tangibilidad these images “in the air”, for example, the interference of several rays ultrasónicos targeted at a specific point where the finger gives a feeling similar to the one that feels if someone were soplándole in the buds of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the wrist bracelets for influencing the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> – Has tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Does Hacerle think he feels it seems that should feel when they see something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> This is a good idea, and we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space that creates goes to an open space, almost endless. we are also working on the idea of the tapes not run (such as gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For now, trick the brain is not so easy, still need to work for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes it appealing to working with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Personal taste subjective instead of culture-Rosbalt. ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> “Rosbalt” continues the project “Vanguardismo St Petersburg”, dedicated to the people who are in front at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the city: often find recognition in Europe without Russia knows even. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the flamboyant artist Kyrill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Garden of summer or in meetings and fashionable inauguraciones. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The scoreboards Kyrill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they display. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kyrill Miller is one of those cuentistas purely sociofilósofos St Petersburg, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kyrill Miller is a brilliant representative of the elitism of St Petersburg of the late 1980s and the early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, it is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city of the inhabitants smiles and closed all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, took in their hands a organillo and became the organillero St Petersburg, which already has matured to make very difficult role, for its bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kyrill, why go through the town dressed in red and yellow or turquesa, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - Chose the red colour because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the colour red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although the society, which is not a little grey prompts aggressiveness and turmoil claims nothing good. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are designed to start a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When will that be comprendiste debías artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> In a statement the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where they showed my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of older artists not official had ended, and the new, free, and I were still incomprendidos. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I took a friend of artists in the new wave, with the subsequent to which it listed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to “Pushkinskaya 10”, and already is the new wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I sumí in theatre for clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And all this coupled in your clinic-art … for me it was important to be in the cultural center in St. Petersburg, where it is needed to meet the best creative minds. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya 10-and, while there was no reforms, there was an artistic music club, a club bohemian, the home of Bohemia in St Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I recall the way in which Schnur brought the project to “the ear of Van Gogh.” </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and his friends sang songs, light under phonogram vestían tight trousers, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, became “Leningrad”. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was cheerleader many programmes before the days of Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> They gave Trachtenberg and was the start of his great career; the basic education and training received from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery 137 “D”, the “Club Griboyedov, are the remnants of the clinic&apos;s art. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and customers regularly. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was “the people of our city.” </seg>
<seg id="880"> In nominating “artist of the year” was elected, I ended my completion. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In this new era is not comfortable work; I am a man who loves the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our time, it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are separate. you can be popular but very little cult. </seg>
<seg id="883"> In your work-there is something recognisable. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expresses the topical and the pun. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to make a scheduled exhibition, “the Russian Museum in clowns.” </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was accessible, but now it is painful and terrifying. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns are embadurna and the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love how grotesque, have ideas grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now one espoused by the clothes, moving externally, but not in the interior of the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And perhaps that person he should not give the hand, but escupirle in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the deception was eliminated when they change clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently-you saw in the role of urban organillero. - a cultured city must have a hero as well. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than me to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> Well-but the best art trade can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Now the art trade must be scrupulous, sweet, take tact. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people agrupaba in herds, bohemios wanted one thing, other simplones. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have been divided into micro-communities, is difficult to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket for a hundred dollars to taste at all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> We must now think about who you want to please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each hero worship has its 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> Van-to see the works there, abandoned the field sex-social. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event are 300 people, 10 thousand never come. as a result, less management, less money, everything is fading. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the most important thing is not deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young was such pictures a collecting the tapeworm perched on the wall beside Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paintings, with which people usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say spiritual culture, consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture of consumption, that is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am in favour of this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kyrill, what is lacking in St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> Good experts-in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can go to the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When kings were correct everything differently, kings, perhaps not very well understood the culture, but knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow there are now very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St Petersburg that could well be experts, but they are closed, because it requires experts to a higher level than properly assessed them and open way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now the thriving personal taste is subjective. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not everything the modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> – What is yours to St Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> St Petersburg-is not a cultural capital. in Moscow, there is much more culture, there are ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones is difficult art grows. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need cultural and now have more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity going to exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> In our case, this class is tiny. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We have to make the art is fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project will be implemented with a subsidy of St Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in space </seg>

<seg id="936"> To preserve the humanity is the main question: how to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet parts? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is little choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> “These are Venus and Mars,” says researcher, head of the state institute astronomical Sternberg, P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin. </seg>

<seg id="943"> For half a century that were conducted experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit not differed in all varieties of land. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then came the breeding insects in orbit, small fruit flies, drosófilas. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, were sent to the area of quail eggs to see how it develops the embryo in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Get a result polluelo normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> “The problem is that this polluelo must find support, must stand on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the institute&apos;s laboratory of problems (Biomédicos IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Science. </seg>
<seg id="950"> To not find support, the chicks gave volteretas randomly. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in the newborn was given a total of atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks will not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And misfortune was that after four days are simply dying. </seg>
<seg id="954"> “And twice we were born the chicks, but then we leave it there because it was impossible to work with them,” said Vladimir, Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the area. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last time a “biological” miniarca flew into orbit was 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, in the “biosatélite Bion” only travel species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space with fetuses. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, was not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> “This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,” said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the rats space had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, it has not yet succeeded in addressing the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot make their sex drive. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating a fund emotional right. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travelling in the area for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk Tereshkova became. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious thing that humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gaviota flying, and nobody on earth could say: if it is after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> May or may not have a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> “After all, nobody has responded to this question,” says the veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just after a year of flight, the first woman into space, cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> There are few are numbered, the astronauts who after long flights all have found it well, and a healthy generation is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> “And if it can be said, is even more dangerous in flights orbitales”, sums up the pilot cosmonaut, hero, hero of the Soviet Union, Russia&apos;s Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, humanity must find some new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hidrolaboratorio centre of cosmonaut preparation is a mandatory step in preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> In conditions of flotabilidad void, the cosmonaut practising their skills to work in the area. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water, simulating the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If an adult water is a comfortable environment, even hostile, for a new-born child element is his home. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small-landing men seem to confirm that life on Earth emerged from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier to get used to the water course. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the moment the first bathing spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> “This is very little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, monitor swimming of newborn babies. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the weightlessness is a state more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness and abdominal muscles of the pelvis is decrepitan very quickly, the ability of expulsion from the fetus is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Good, but this, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, giving birth in a House special, this one boutique. </seg>
<seg id="993"> “And then what?”, Valeri Polyakov makes this original question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Moreover, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the sense of gravity, the body does not produce the skeleton or the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn in orbit is impossible vestirlo with a suit for special exercises, as adults. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Simply being deprived of what is vital for him. </seg>
<seg id="998"> “And this experiment that we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, lead to bring to the land to a disabled person, a person completely unsuited”, provides the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Science, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> For now, the birth of children in the area is a theoretical question. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Over time, however, this will be a reality, when human beings in their craft are directed to a distant planet that is home to their children born in the area. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Chief: NKÚ inspection system “švarc” has not given the political blame </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In terms of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its implementation impaired. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> So says Miloslav Kala, vice-chairman of the supervisory office Supreme (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> “The law will never be perfect”, but its application must be correct. “this is, in my opinion, what we lack,” describes the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The joint controls of the czech and german inspectors also come to similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of bad practice, mentions the attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the “švarc system.” </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) not disturb employers with inspectors, so it is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> “The law must be regulated in some way and if ban something, in this case, or the President of the government cannot prevent the actions of the office that has the obligation to carry out these checks or require obligations,” notes Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the czech and german team, in the context of which compared the legislation concerning the public contracts in both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What is it exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> This is a parallel control that we have started to make some two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Said simplified: european legislation regularise how to organise the contracts public, this was still the existing legislation in each country and, later, the practice itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have united and, although the control has not yet been completed, we got very interesting differences. generally, the law of our country is “stronger and more complete”, however, the practice in some specific parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate rules increasingly strict, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can bring to this project? what it believes they are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Common control of this kind could help stop efforts to implement the laws, the reduction and improvement of the limits, although this will not have an extremely positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy of savings mean getting a proper thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, eventually, the criminal actions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not by reducing the limit contracts mean that we will achieve this. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated with both “red tape”, that those who want to find flaws in the system can do it more easily than if the limits are maintained as high as now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing the prácticaa of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of controls in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> An office is similar to our NKÚ or organised differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In offices, as the NKÚ there, acting Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organisation similar to our own, with a school, it is just that his case is structured in a way somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also powers are to some extent analógas, however, as Germany has an organization federal courts, they are even at this level in this differs slightly from our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only monitor the federal money, what we call state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, will be monitored in the Federal Court of Auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local legislation, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would like to set up a comparison without specific data. however, Germany remains a model in some aspects, but it cannot specify exactly what is best. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That is for sure, but not, I repeat not, I like to make such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It must be said that even those countries that we took as a model must cope with a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If this were not the case, it would be of no benefit to collaborate with our office, do you not think? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> In regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his office Amendment law on public contracts? manifests itself in some way their incidence? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Bearing in mind that the validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been expressed in the actions of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Given that check ex post, is needed with a delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For now, it is in the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new tool to detect risks “non-economic”, which we have done nearly 14,000 public contracts, which have been analysed. changes will be perfectly reflected here, since it limits, they adjusted the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that will be the case. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that the regulations are “hardened” and that it would be impossible to deliver. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> As with the previous rules, people controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes from the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does it make sense to then toughen the law in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how is this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> See where this road leads us started. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister has recently declared that the ODS not disturb employers with controls system called švarc, with reference to the fact be autonomous only on paper, what does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Does the system švarc” is banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be regulated in some way and, if ban something, then even the Prime Minister&apos;s government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out these checks and demand obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Can say: “change the law and allow”, but cannot say that we will do as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> In the law on public contracts, regulations are strict enough in terms of the way in which it must act formally. and that is as it should be to protect the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best offer for not complying with the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but their application must be correct. this is, in my opinion, what we need. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are plates of ice, albeit mostly impassable </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In several parts of the Czech Republic roads with plates of ice and snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Although most of the tracks are impassable in some caution should be taken. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Region of Karlovy Vary </seg>
<seg id="1058"> This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but with plates of ice and snow. </seg>

<seg id="1060"> He stopped nevar in the region and in the low lying areas the layer of snow is fine. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> In contrast, in the ridges of the Metálicos snow reaches almost 30 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> In some places the visibility was still bad because of the fog, according to information from the control centre of operations of the roads in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The fast track and R6 road first category in the region are now passable without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> However, it recommends exercise caution, especially in some bridges whose surface can be helada and be slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Also, are also usable all avenues of second and third category, including the mountain roads. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> However, some of them are still stretches with traces of ice and snow apisonada. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> There is a need to increase the attention on the road, especially in areas higher. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Region and Pardubice Hradec Králové </seg>
<seg id="1069"> In some roads of eastern Bohemia there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains may have formed a layer of snow on the tracks, reported in its pages the direction of roads and motorways. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> Operators of roads to warn motorists about the danger that train plates of ice, especially in higher areas of the region of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the roads of second and third category. </seg>

<seg id="1080"> After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some routes could also be covered in ice. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> In some places, drivers will find themselves with fog, but the visibility improve gradually. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> This is clear from the information from the control centre of operations of roads in the region. </seg>

<seg id="1084"> The surface of most of the roads in the first category is dry and free of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany may have sections with plates of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The second and third category are wet, so in this case, it also warns of tranches with plates of ice. </seg>

<seg id="1089"> Drivers who are directed to the highest areas of the region of Olomouc will find snow partially dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> After the chemical processing, there was snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Operators of roads cleared the snow during the night; on the road of Šumper piled up about three inches of snow, according to the administrators of the track. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest: in our concerts to accumulate positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> He says that in less than a month to reach the end of the world, what are your thoughts on this? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one of many other news stories that we like to cling. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> The music group The Tap Tap we like rather make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that fails to muster enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, in December organizáis a project really original: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you explain it to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> This is an act of beneficent state that we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to harness the potential of marketing that is the end of the mayan calendar set out for the December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The previous day, 20 December at 3 p. m., organise simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> End around the same time that the mayan calendar ends in Kiribati, the island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea after we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In addition to muster enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the state of the world we leave our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> With the end of the mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of articles: shoes, shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be bought at www. e-tap. cz, another form of support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the anthem called against the end of the world, which carries the title “end of the world”, cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is currently very popular on YouTube, will hear in concerts beneficial? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Yes, and it will be just the latest, well, provided that all goes well and is not the end of the world … </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The performers sing all at the same time in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The anthems are enlazarán among themselves simultaneously thanks to the special broadcast live on television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and interprets the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, which also sings Xindl X … </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How has this collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Even working together with other leading figures in the cultural scene Czech, apart from organising many charitable acts and concerts … </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We put all our efforts into participating in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has shown that the majority of them interested and amused to work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Why spend the money raised in concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studeo, in its sixth consecutive year with the civil partnership Tap in Jedličkův ústav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The pupils of the school of Jedličkův ústav are regularly visit of teachers with performing amusing and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Pupils do not have adequate financial resources to pay teachers and do a efuerzo to make that possible. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building that we move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> In each concert act several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Trying to draw up a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague act Chinaski, support, with Dan Lesbiens Illustratosphere Bárta, the Tap Tap, Bango and Marián Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For more detailed information, you can consult www. kpks. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you have any other planned “spectacular action” similar in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, playing for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here probably will prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also touch on the Bohemian National Hall of New York and for me, personally, while we are in the United States, I would like to add actions in Washington and in Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is the logistics and the organisation of these trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not so difficult to how it might appear at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> There are five people in wheelchairs, electric chairs must travel in the compartment for luggage and carry much weight, the boxes with the instruments … </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, until now we managed well. ČSA and British Airways were well prepared, something that never ceases to amaze me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently come back, everything went smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you found so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here in Russia; we have witnessed in this, there is still a long way to go. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of obstacles, there is still not often that one person travelling alone in the centre of the city in an electric wheelchair. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Something as ordinary as is, for example, giving priority to someone in a wheelchair lift in there, it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, it has created a civil partnership which strives to focus attention problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> What improvements should take a leaf out of more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many ways in which we go behind … </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to mention that the upgrading and improving the situation always depends on the people who are directly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a severe disability moves on his mind in public service, and can go to the museum, wherever … </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities to participate in the social life of active in this area, with the Tap Tap going a bit ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A society that respects or without barriers is one thing, but when it comes time to emerge, eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will start to change everything really. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Until now, are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is now very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered as educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to engage in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician, raised, among others, saxofón, founded a group of amateur with a workmate. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it was a little hands (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that helped us quite connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that cannot be seen, it is as if it did not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can afford in teacher quality, equipment, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Does Tenías intention of reaching so far with the Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the outset I saw the potential that had, that something can be done otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The entertainment industry is full of things that resemble each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, in its way, everything new is viewed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few extraordinary things, but I would venture to say that the Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression of someone who see us for the first time is clearly the compassion, is a natural reaction … </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not being left to suffer and that we should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that have the necessary tools. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if something comes to people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> What helped is the fact that you are a demanding boss, as it describes a lot of people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to make a work of quality, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> I think that is completely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they hear that they must come two days to rehearse, go to the test preparatory and spend a lot of time travelling and concerts in the initial euphoria abandons them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently the group The Tap Tap has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group opened, people enters and leaves, cannot be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who takes willingness and desire will always find the open doors </seg>
<seg id="1190"> The day before the expected end of the world, the 20.12.2012 Thursday at 9 p. m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno and Fléda of Plynojem in Ostrava and participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via videoconference together to sing the song&apos;s group The Tap Tap “end of the world,” canceled </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment educational centre without barriers STUDEO Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which cost $25 million czech crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry on the option of selling early Bohemiaticket </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency held last week was accepted to Poland as a 12th member of the ESA is the second member of the ESA&apos;s former block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during subsequent years participated in the Commission projects the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> However, the path of Poland to the cosmos began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The polish enthusiasts already went to flights into space before World War II, if not always understand his work. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember, for example, the Conference of A. Šternfeld astronomical observatory in Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study “introduction to cosmonáutica.” </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born the 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one that had shown interest in her work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, the year Šternfeld won the prize in France-Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his “introduction to the cosmonáutica.” </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned earlier, became later in a big driver of astronomy and cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Published hundreds of articles in magazines polish and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, I myself was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the cráteres of the dark side of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Earlier in the year it was built in 1925 a dresina Poland that was supposed to be carrying a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and does not know the destalles project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket would be used to start dresina or braking. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this dresina is confined to the collection in the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From the year 1933 polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the material preserved, it becomes clear that the research came to the stadium testing practices. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, with the arrival of german troops, was interrupted research. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In the year 1937 appeared in the press specialist the prototype of a missile hunting photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study “Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza”, the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were intended for military use of engines for missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, the Scientific Advisory Committee (provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all the projects techniques of missiles for military use and coordinated all of the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the outbreak of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Other studies devoted to cosmonáutica appeared in the polish press after the war thanks to the work of polish society of Astronáutica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> In November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy refers to the society for the first time with four very lengthy articles devoted to the astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that is devoted to cosmonáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the research was a cosmic discipline with future prospects. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of the 1956 polish society of Astronáutica (PTA) was part of the International Federation of Astronáutica (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year, the PTA became a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronáutica. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> Played this position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA contributed significantly to the development of rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first polish rocket that carried out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket had a height of 800 metres, around 80 cm and not reached 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, they finished building the RM-1a version, and in the summer of 1959 began testing air rockets RM-2 two stages in the desert Błędów. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket centimeters 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Another type of rocket in development would be subject to scientific study real. rocket RM-34 was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and their mission would be to control the wind. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> However, in 1962, was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The successor to the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> As rocket was designed in two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and a weight of initial 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Ran three types (called Meteor-1A, 1B-and-1C), which differed among themselves for the space available for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> In the rocket Meteor-1a space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0,34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum height in the three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> The years between 1965 and 1968 was developed at the Institute Sky rocket Meteor-2, whose first test flight began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg until 60 km in height. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Subsequently built version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the training of the national committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Under the programme, Interkosmos Poland joined the space research on artificial satellites cósmico Soviets and, in 1978, the year the polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week the court suspended constitutional law traabajos social. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution was a heated discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal economic systems in the EU, like in the globalised world, is based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Consequently, this means that different forms of economic and national economic systems are in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital and unlimited private, together with the rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of the big differences in the cost of labour (salaries) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with imports of cheap goods, tries to narrow the gap and to this “causes a bajadda” the price of competitor with the aim of taking the lion&apos;s share of the market and thus increase their profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale means, for the majority of employers, moving production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear; the result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because the private capital has no responsibility to society and therefore is not responsible for unemployment that creates this phenomenon, growing necessarily social spending in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation leads to the total lack of employers to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damage that has been caused in their pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so universally known that there is no need to submit statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of the population itself and, in this way, to attract foreign capital to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Said another way, governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is evident, particularly in changes in existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the law restricted employees regarding employment rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty along with the widening of the gap between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a number of years in Germany, there are points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot stay with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people receiving this type of aid arrives already million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing competitiveness of the german economy, there is a fairly rare event: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> It became a public scandal of this kind on the situation of the junior employees in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Saving measures virtually all the southern states of the EU are, without doubt, the same situation. people, pressured by a decline of its profound social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or malvivir salary with a rotten on the fringes of society, with the hope that one day the country capital private investor. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Is it necessary preguntrarse comes from where? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or not never, since the Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Egyptians, Moroccans or Africans still working for a tiny part of a european salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also affects the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theories and the media say ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, to steer the economy leads to failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddled in control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then, it is necessary to ask if private capital would not influence their selfishness in the political march, and therefore in the entire state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> In this case, the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice, very powerful and pervasive in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation that occurs in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, under legislation that is reprehensible virtually everywhere but it is not a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is this: the government ministries, to lack of financial resources, responsible for drafting bills to private law firms, which are often connected with the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Such bills are approved after in the Bundestag, the German Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> In this way, all the power comes from the people, as announced in the constitutions of the western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that democracies with a liberal approach quickly find themselves in a situation which describes how Appiános on his site, the crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: “the state had time disintegrating and authorities were working to force.” </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegally and help finance stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people going to the polls with voting apalabrado beforehand” … “no people with character aspirara for a post in the administration, so once, because of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls” … “began to talk seriously, that the only remedy to a very serious situation was autocracy and that there was a need to choose a strong man” … although Appiános thought in Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed the democracy forever autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, in the same way that in ancient times, is that the current society is based on preferences inconsiderate of individual benefits without taking into account the common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is not capable, in its essence, understand and claim benefits for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same as then, decaying elite unprecedented, without making an effort to reform it in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes of the boom of the fascist and communist regimes should be sought, therefore, in the liberalisation of the unbridled economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, defined as a pause, awaiting the next blow. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The really damning fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution; at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the level of social security for the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is, therefore, systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution involves sociopolitical concrete reforms, which will strengthen both the involvement of the state capital as citizens&apos; influence on the government and undermine the monopoly position of private capital in society in the interests of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: the laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> “That nothing comes from difficult and nothing ever could” (stems not from the violence and could do nothing), Sting in their song Fragile and whose refrain reads “Let&apos;s do not forget how fragile we are” (let us not forget how fragile we are). </seg>
<seg id="1293"> “If my children did not want war, there would be no” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his death bed in the year 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and encasilla Palestinians in the role of terrorists. the other supports to the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Arabs and Palestinians suspected terrorist state of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings, which occur regularly and who is the victim. after all, citizens today of Israel, including the autonomous territories, born within the current political situation and not lived through the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, looking to discover who tapped the tensions that linger for 95 years (calculated on the basis of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my thoughts are based on historical facts, in other conclusions have been reached on the basis of my own way to understand the issue, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In the history of mankind&apos;s history the struggles for power is in the front row. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> But what is not so clear is whether these were always characters who channeled their steps autonomously or if behind his throne had someone that meant their actions toward a particular goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth in the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of power and money that this entails, has not been able to get in a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among these families astronomically wealthy highlights a that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, but I do not exclude): Rothschild. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> In the 1990s the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating its name with criminal acts of great seriousness. power and wealth, or both, I covered the shoulders, which for them always meant a strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major stakes in almost all the world&apos;s central banks and in those countries who are not represented, has been found or is preparing a war: before the attack in Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi were only four, but in the meantime, Russia has linked the central bank to the russian government. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to resist this family has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state central bank Bank of America of Rothschild, began during the war of secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Jfk began to print money and wanted to suspend the system of Federal Reserve (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned year 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for having triggered the economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their quest for global power led them over the years 1859-1871 to chart a plan with three world wars, designed by masón Albert Pike, decorated with the 33 degree. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was marked as objective of eliminating the big royal states across Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially Britain, and the third is proposing to reduce the population of the land between half a million and 1 million people (this amount of slaves to their welfare and luxury and not simply consume so many resources), and the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which operates the group of the richest families, along with Rothschild, follows the dynamic of the onset of a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (ab Cao order-order from chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are, however, wrong, and always carry a worsening situation. if not, just remember that EDF was created not to repeat such a crisis of 1907. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, following the success of the murder of the heir to the Austro-hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, triggered the first World War, trashed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified militarily and economically, the surrender of Germany (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent break-up of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To prepare the ground for the Second World War, allowed the bankers and politicians created, covertly, a difficult situation because of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, created optimum conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses. then, enough to serve the Germans to the solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and indicated to guilty after Czechoslovakia, and build a composed of various nationalities with a strong german minority should play so well represented and the role of the fifth column, that the flame ignited and caused the outbreak of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild led the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a jewish state, preferably in the region of the ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned previously laid the foundations for the mass immigration of jews to Palestine and began the first conflict with the arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much rope to which he had tied the international bankers initially or if all he did was part of a plan. however, the suffering of european jews in concentration camps created optimum conditions for accepting the jewish state in the global society. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the declaration of the state of Israel was created, the focus for a third war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers to restart, the jewish nation, as in the Second World War, become a victim in the front line of combat, now with the people of Arab or Muslim, generally, in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. take, for example, how they divide so emphatically supporters and opponents of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-palestinian conflict? where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether at the start of all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as is happening in our country, the only international bankers have their candidates in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist political, loyal to international bankers, which is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran, and considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan …), threaten to become a global conflict and, bearing in mind that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of all global oil (row navigation has only two miles across), will lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under what is now the light show words David Rockefeller in 1994: “all we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.” </seg>

<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the aristocracy financially well off. </seg>

<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a group of Islamist students occupied the manifestation of the american embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> His release would be to change the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution, fled to the US, which had sponsored his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation for the american administration did not offer any positive outlook: throw the Shah overboard not you could afford, because, if they did, endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the formation of the theocratic regime, was not in its scope. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which then escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were released imprisoned 444 days after negotiating the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> In the US, their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animus against Iran. </seg>

<seg id="1346"> After a complicated journey, ended in the residence of the canadian embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities managed to extricate them from Iran, so that helped a covert history: a flamboyant came with canadian passports, as members of the team film that looked at the location in the country for the filming of a surfeit of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Mix of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan drew expert in “exfiltración” Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> For the lie seemed truthful, wrote about the film project in peer review journals, held press conferences, the society of fictitious production had even a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details on the operation was kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck&apos;s film is a unique combination of various genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, a political thriller realistic; on the other, a so-called “caper movie,” the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the series Ocean&apos;s Eleven). </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The film combines the moods. are a well-documented sequences of Tehran in the sequence of credit is emblematic of the era show photographs of events, which were recorded in the same way in the film; there are not many differences here. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, scenes typical of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And furthermore, scenes of the CIA and other institutions: men clad that analyse the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone … </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> The actor, who had been the subject of ridicule, has become a respectable director and his way of operating has ceased to be the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is its third largometraje, after small “Goodbye, goodbye” (2007) and the thriller “The Town. city of thieves” (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film, Affleck in which the action takes place not in the city of Boston, where they raised. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that threw the directors of old films above standards of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck shows in Argo, where Tehran is “wheel” in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events truthful. the introductory sequence-the embassy is impressive for its ability to transparent, at the same time, passes the thrill of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his colleagues achieved a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team impostor in the bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to accept the fact that a story explained it offers much in the way of film scenes more intriguing. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> And manages quite well: sometimes it adds something to the reality here: not everything is so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the frantic quest after its runway become crazy). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the mismanagement that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a role very funny as collaborators of Hollywood, although his characters deserved more space, and they are far from the only ones in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> For these reasons, the film, Affleck loses a bit of painting dramatic, but is a lack that they can continue with a moderate interest, to assess its performance and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But that crash, this will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As images of a real story as proof of what can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Rules for the inflated balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www. bankovnipoplatky. com, which each year offers a survey on bank charges more absurd, has now decided to announce the contest on “the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the workshop of the EU”. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> “We came after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women in leadership positions in big european companies,” explained Patrik Právo Nacher, the organiser of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurd nonsense is, for example, the recent decision of the european court to unify insurance policyholders between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, women are aventajaban better prices in life insurance, because they are objectively a minor risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> “Other ideas incredible workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people until the end of this year.” </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” reported Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial EU regulations, for example, is adding compulsory components to fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another is to ban the use of mercury thermometers life only because they contain a small amount of a substance or dangerous guideline sombre the size of cages for hens, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> It has criticised the ban of using the expression “butter,” or the withdrawal of the bulb classic shops. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> A banana quality must have a length of 14 inches. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The apparatus of the Union making decisions of this kind are often under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally advocated by some state or group of states — the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that bananas more quality in the EU should have a length of at least 14 centimetres and could not present “curvaturas abnormal.” </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission is saying that it only seeks to harmonise national rules do not homogenized to date, only complicaban its marketing. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The rules that make reference to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive represents a waste of edible. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the US last year whereby balloons inflables traded is compulsory warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to inflating them without the supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The US referred to a study american according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is also a similar restrictions applicable to the use of matasuegras by children of up to 14 years. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Witticisms curious born even in our country </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Equally absurd regulation concerning european officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. not to offend the sensitivities of Greece, it must speak FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovnípoplatky. com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominó in the survey, including some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU ruled the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day our entry into the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> After the Czech Republic topped, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey also attracted the occurrence of pay to those countries which do not have access to the sea and the idea of giving a subsidy to the grant application. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> This kind of ideas emerged in Brussels but in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> “We are at a disadvantage by not having sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We call on the European Union a compensation,” declared in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> I argued with the fact that our country has produced much grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> In the end, the European Commission was ready to help in the Czech Republic and hosted a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidy was to receive a grant proposal to municipalities by the Ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). in particular, is aimed at drafting subsidy requests from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Eu: prescriptions are a rare exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> The guidelines of the Member States are often targets of criticism, the efforts of EU regulations and also a functioning and development more effective throughout the Union deserve more, according to several experts, our recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the recovery of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of the european integration, but member states have made in the negotiations on budgets. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Czechs also strikes a chord, in the same way that other EU countries, fighting for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these disputes. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czechs, after six years of disputes with german and austrian, successfully defended the designation of origin of mascarpone of Olomouc, but had to change its name to the rum, whose national tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as “tuzemák.” </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only products made from distilled from sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of protected designation of origin of the EU, along with the feta cheese and gorgonzola known around the world, the german city of Lübeck mazapán or Parma ham, are already for example biscuits of Karlovy Vary, carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec. </seg>

<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how it happened to stand in the elections for President? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not about being a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If our country was all right, then do not present my candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But can no longer bear to see how stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and retirement ages. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to be political. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something that I do not like it, trying to come up with a solution for change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only way to change things is to stand as a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The Senate has already arrived, but soon after was placed on the way to the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Does giving back to those people who voted for? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on election results in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later stated that if he was elected a senator, put my candidacy for the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> But my goal is not the role; the role is the tool that I can make my own ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Why have the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that we are a nation that is critical in the bar or in front of the tv, but trampling under foot to anyone who wants to start a change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> This is adding to the media, you discredit and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> I was saying I bribed to journalists or have been adviser Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are going to talk about their ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> It makes the fight presidential thesis with financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property above 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> This should change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President not only has this competition and the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How can you resolve it? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have formed part of a group lobbying for the job guide is recognised as independent, and we succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is in the policy: if someone arrives with a good proposal, either right or left, it rejects purpose and this affects people. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent candidate, have a greater potential to obtain the support of all groups. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Without encasillamientos or dogmas of party, have the capacity to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Is it more a man of right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I considered more left-wing. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, it is not important whether a little left or a little right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> What matters to me is that we come out ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> I do not care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or SDGS and, in the same way, I am against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> A joke when they told you that is populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But it is not showing with what he says? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you have certain goals and ideals. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Try to acercarte E. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> There will be those who summons populism, but all the proposals that I already operating in the world or known experts talk about them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And it cannot survive in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you believe that if he is going to the people and talk to them, get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve this. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If elected president, there would be no problem in organising a broadcast live on television in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties that legitimaran the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and state prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And, eventually, they have to communicate why they do not want it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong character who says disputes, it can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been a triumph of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> At the same time I say that I am just a fan, I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> For my views and ideals attempt to seek allies. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I start in politics and attempt to achieve the greatest possible support for my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Attempt to drive things forward myself, but in case that does not go well, within six years leave and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Sounds a bit like Okamura outside to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that a person cannot do nothing, why I have visited a number of well-known personalities, if best animaran to submit his candidacy for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to see Radim Jančura but refused because he had a lot of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For my part, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud with light heating oils. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I stood on the basis that people are really disappointed, I am now in the balance. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of the population turned out to vote, and those who did, voted for representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate are two of the independent sector. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people elected to the Senate, in such a way that it will be difficult to make changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Is considering forming his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Yet I felt because I have no time for this, to see past the repute of each potential members of the party, nor do I have money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money or to campaign for the presidency, transparent in my mind there are only 20,000 kronor. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Do you have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Talk of statements of the property, how is it yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think my private property in 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague have a ground valued at 25 billion, an apartment worth 10 million apartment, another restriction in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin of 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and realise I have a couple of million. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of Youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, he was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the evil words and deeds and injustices. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> What leads an Aston Martin, their property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want to change the Republic but not to put too much money on his part. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Do I endeudarme? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign have already made 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that has no sponsor shows that there is much interest in my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of covering the campaign in essence what will be payable in the form of salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live. for example, could not pay my son the english school, which costs 30 SEK monthly. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only earn money, then I do not run as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So that will continue with their business to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Has not said before that it was going to stop this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> This has nothing to do with a higher salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, in part, I left my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People wanted to be the samaritano salvase that the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to live. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How accustomed to win monthly as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Between 200,000 and 400,000, still winning. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were President, then leave the business. </seg>

<seg id="1501"> The study of architecture MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head-on the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed “mountain of books” - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> “I think that the building is fun, futuristic looks, and finally there is something interesting to do,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, technical configuration in a large company located near the library, notes: “in addition, the building is beautiful.” </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we need a library today. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Nobody is happy in those libraries by old-fashioned, no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a city located in the bedroom doors of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having taken a record to forget. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the literacy rate lowest in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counter this shameful situation, some years ago decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copying the fictitious seven bridges that are represented in the euro notes in the form of miniaturas concrete armed dwellings. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive education was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so it was as policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: had to build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the study of dutch architecture MVRDV, a master in the art of diagrams of rods and responsible for buildings to the sexy couple that cynical, took issue with his usual calm and came to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked puzzled and encogía around her shoulders, Maas proceeded to pile books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the words: “ladies and fellow citizens: </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here is my proposal for the mountain of books Spijkenisse, the so-called “Boekenberg.”” </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 billion was closed on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It forms part of the revitalization project, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and backed. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November the mountain of books was awarded second prize with “Best Library of NL 2012 .” </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project is also nominated the “Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .” </seg>
<seg id="1519"> In this way, the small city devoid of history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian zone post-modern and incredibly ugly after a city whose white façade one intuiría rather a dairy plant, now boasts a work of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a quesera. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> It is true that there is an elevator that brings us right at the centre of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading does not use it, but prefer merged with its topography every step of his rise to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The internal completely acristalado is bright and easy to cover with the view, the soil and the elegant brick recocido lampposts unequivocally support the condition of the public library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The look can be achieved to visualise the banks of the park, dogs and children playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And all sorts of books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> “Usually the shelves of books are arrayed along the front and center opens a huge dark room that, in general, it tends to be rather awkward and impersonal,” says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What we have done is put upside down the classic shape space and make the area of reading the internal abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain is very well taken: in the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, the center of environmental education and the room of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Deserve special mention the black shelves that assume the roles of coating parapet barandilla mural, and at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The view, tact and nostrils are strangers. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers more civilians the day shake their heads when they hear talk of this material is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> “We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And that is how a day on a farm frisia, we come up with a suitable from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands are using plastic fabric a few millimetres thick as a basis for subjecting the roots of the crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> This is cheap and efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library that fabric prensó, for the first time in such quantities, to achieve slab of four centimetres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With the heat and pressure, the so-called plastic agricultural (KLP) changes colour and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and resilient that smells like a mix of new car and zapatilla of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 rungs reaches the top of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of this route continued almost 500 metres around the mountain awaits us reward: from the cafeteria is not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy tasty croquetas dutch and planted ficus in enormous pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create a congenial atmosphere while maintaining adequate moisture air to this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations to a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> “Though it is difficult to believe, given its hypermarkets acristaladas, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The heating and cooling needed obtained using geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even in the more sunny days the sun shines for only a few hours in his home. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The huge cerchas wood located in sense across the facade of glass used to shadow and absorb the majority of the rays of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a climate internal comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is a thing of automatic shutters. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, sceptical worker of information technology, already has dared to put a foot in the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Equally, the professor of traditional chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. she describes the “Boekenberg” as the “soul” of late Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is that, with the official opening which took place a couple of weeks ago, was invited to all the city&apos;s inhabitants to donate a book of his private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This aims to fill the voids optical a library that does not yet have its full archive; currently has 70,000 copies. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> “There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> “I think that, thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain affinity with this building. </seg>

<seg id="1561"> Although it is only there to embellish. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in the discipline that reigns in the specialist slang is known as “creating an identity.” </seg>

<seg id="1566"> Szabo: “the Germans must play a leading role” </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations US-Europe, this puts Berlin in a diplomatic position quite tricky. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinians the status of observer state in the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time I think that also supports the american position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when the task was to establish a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This has finally been declared by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Do you find it difficult to Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because at the moment is moving its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a german foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what makes it more difficult is that the Europeans have no coherent policy and uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not accustomed to doing. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think we are still probing what its role, but they have already begun the journey towards a foreign policy “normal”. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What specifically means a foreign policy “normal” from the german point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different to the United States and its european partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that german foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, namely in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The german economic interests are somewhat different to the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Will these economic interests have influenced the position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this reason must be careful and not alienate itself from the arab public opinion, nor the arab elites. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I do not give much importance because it is not a completely one-sided. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> It does, however, play a key role in the german considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, the german position enjoys a huge degree of understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a breakdown as drastic as in the case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with that Germany has managed to acquire a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, all this has done nothing but prove that a country that is taken seriously as an international player and whose interests are taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different opinions about the palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Instead, the US has been shown clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there disparity of views between the US and many european nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been these disparities due to internal american politics. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding towards the european position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the political situation we are living here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that stance in public. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real disparity of views is not actually the importance attributed to it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Do you find it difficult to reconcile Germany&apos;s close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent european policy and homogenous, but that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they have the possibility of forming part of a superior, but must take things from his own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future, Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a european position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course this is not easy for Germany, whether simply because the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a thorny issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think that the Germans have clear who should play the role of independent figure. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Is Germany itself in the role of important international player? is there in fact Germany take a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or perhaps still finds it hard to accept that leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet been used, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, is costing the country continues to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that each time Germany positions itself as a key player, occur certain feelings antialemanes. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is an old problem, which is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Should show a receptive attitude towards the neighbours and different opinions and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of the US in european policy ever dwindling, but the EU does not cover of that gap, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will have no choice but to take a more prominent role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like it, if it is unpleasant or if it makes people even more unpopular, c&apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is Executive Director of the Transatlantic Institute in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analysed jointly the challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, which specialises in german politics, american foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> “Protection of trademarks in China”: when Puma and Armani are suddenly in chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> After it conceals a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it enjoys protection while the real epónimos not lodge a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then, it is not clear that they are going to be the reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> “Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specialising in violations of rights protection in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week reaches my desk a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Copycats simply adds a couple of letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-instead of Gucci and Prada is Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also legally copy of the same way, as happened to sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens drawers in which bears seats of the Trademark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> 14 September 2010, a chinese company called registering the trademark Zegna DF Puma artificial, a name which is also served by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The Chinese are world champions in this copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities, there are large stores of various plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, cases of Pattloch are other. on behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the Trademark Office granted an official chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered in another place. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The chinese call it “Bang Ming Pai” or brand companion. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The floor has its origin in the chinese word “Bang Dakuan” </seg>
<seg id="1649"> That refers to women who have “fish” to a wealthy man. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The chinese authorities do not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> “It is bad for business, we have to fight this,” requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> “The brand is taking on water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.” </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and litigation costs of sectors are affected millions, especially in the case of flagship luxury products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to data from the market research firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is the third market in size, luxury goods and the fastest-growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, the cancellation of inscriptions of dubious legality in trademark registration is complicated and involves a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The processes can be extended to nine years and the outcome is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks of cases in which the Court dismissed a demand because so much time had elapsed since the name to demand already had become a “real market”. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> “If the complainant has bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China,” says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes that is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, a company that has been absorbed by the german manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Why the Chinese can continue using an emblem is very similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, globally, used initially a logo in white and blue, who recalled largely BMW; the issue is judging in the courts and globally had to change. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of Lacoste clothes lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose logo was a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The chinese authorities do not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing recognises that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, the “emergency situation labour returned to normality.” </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this way, the number of processes without complaint process has been reduced by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81.500 claims are still pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Combat that costs a lot of money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As is customary in China, the figures are startling. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million requests for protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a new record and means that China leads for the tenth consecutive year, the list of new registrations across the world, according to the office of brands. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid stitched, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 have been pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in concept of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Said another way, this means that on average each listing 1.280 yuan or costs 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Combat that costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the family firm German Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the group wrangling in the courts against a copycat Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of spare car imitation, </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The copier has managed to secure the rights chinese trademark Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> “We ourselves have caused this situation in Germany because the names are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, chairman and adviser representative of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office CTMO also dismissed the appeal of muniqueses. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the subsequent two bodies have given the right Freudenberg, but the opposing side still struggling today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> We take great care </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the case has reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where remains outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler hopes to settle for the point and praised the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, it also says that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.” </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the archive business has had to review files of up to 100 years old to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a “six-figure sum” in euros with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but had no success. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> “This shows how much we care,” says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers that lurk in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe, </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Particularly if there are copycats claim rights over brands not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thus, a chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and fur products. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> It is about time the group abandoned this trade, but to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> “We need to be extremely careful,” says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend german companies which are extremely wary of doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what we need to do is to “register in China everything that can be susceptible to protection”, as indicated by Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the issue may be more expensive than a simple registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, in the case of Freudenberg lost the latest round of his particular battle, then have to pay the other side licence fees on his own behalf, as Wentzler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> That or in the segment in question us expulsarían market. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Day of the fight against AIDS: dance, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg venturing the chorus Imbongi and Swaziland are pleased the AIDS orphans </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a link can overcome much more 8.733 kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> It starts with the first dance: cowboy boots, slippers, basketball shoes and tacón mocasines seeking the compass on the soil of parquet, and find them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then will slowly begin to elevate the voices of singers (contralto, low, tenor and soprano), arremolinándose entorpeciéndose siguiéndose, and to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatening to get almost their boxes to try to bring order to its energetic gestures and gentle. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi is trying a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> They have also reached the 50 singers, between 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until the house husband. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> “Om&apos;Obani” is not an easy piece, every voice to the chorus has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some areas of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Helping people to help themselves </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to fight AIDS around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland is 245.000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40% of the population is already positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Seventy of them attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> By 15 or 20 euros per month can be apadrinar a child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This contribution will cover the plate of school uniforms, and ensure a warm meals per day in the Gogo Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> In Zulu narrador Imbongi means “stories” or “panegirista.” </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this room, nobody knows about this Bantu language fluently, but claim they know. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For ten years, this chorus venturing songs in this gentle foreign language sometimes manages to carry them to their place of origin: South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> To 8.733 miles in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this german choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty per cent is infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple shacks of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 are no longer because parents have succumbed to AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the rate of AIDS infection highest and lowest life expectancy around the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population does not look favourably on circumcision, a practice that has been shown reduces the risk of contagion. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered this recóndita population, but what they saw especially were many children in the streets that lacked not only of the protection of their parents, but the main: food, clothes and training. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without school title, the possibilities in a poor country are slim. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was only the particular commitment of a few that made possible a child outside the college and enjoy a hot meal per day. all this for a few euros. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> However, a year after the chorus founded the association “Voices for Africa” that has since been occupied professionally in the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the main sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Between the ETS bacteria are the origin of syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrea. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The ETS origin vírico are more usual AIDS, human papilloma virus, herpes genital or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The ladillas and sarna are among the ETS waterborne parasites. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the main groups affected? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The syphilis and gonorrea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute, part of the base that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origins in a sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are more common infections, chlamydia tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (mushroom) and gonorrea. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, roughly 20% of new HIV infections occurring in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to Eurobarometer poll, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> In our country, the human papilloma viruses also adds to the disease more common among the young. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has evolved the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infections has doubled its number of syphilis cases in 2001 to $1.697 3.698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections continues a downward trend since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It is a tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate that this is a disease venérea? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, inconvenience to orinar, flow, abdominal pain, as well as tablets or verrugas. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Not often cause cause pain or other symptoms and should therefore not be detected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can you protect? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but offer no protection to 100 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> For this reason, experts recommend to undergo regular medical examinations, especially if they change often sex partner. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> If diagnosed early, so the majority of the ets can be cured, and it is possible to avoid any result late. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through partnerships, donations and, last but not least, the fees they charged the chorus for its actions across Germany, arriving to raise enough money. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> “In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni proud,” says Annette Lennartz, President of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the people themselves Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and with gifts of leadership manages the money sent from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> Deals that orphans are a good accommodation, for example with a granny. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> “Gogos”, as it is called older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have until 14 orphans to his office, offer them a roof to live and take care of the children go to school every day and promptly dressed in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who have no one left under the protection of an unwed woman Khanyisile, which, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 children hungry, receives a salary of the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, “Voices of Africa” has launched a school. has built two barns and, in collaboration with the american health organization PSI, which has achieved many of the village&apos;s inhabitants have been subjected to an HIV test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not obvious, since, despite the apparent is that this disease throughout the country, is usually not talk openly about it. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> “AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.” </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Something strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch, Sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Poligamia instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> This way of life not accepted officially is in large part responsible for the spread so fast that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But it is also due to the myriad seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to another, and they are where they are going. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> According to Annette Lennartz, “in any corner may get free condoms, but these are barely used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Here is another culture, only accepted the skin against skin contact.” </seg>
<seg id="1780"> To encourage cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa to sing songs that speak of melancholy, pugnacity, hope and confidence in the black, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the african continent still reminiscent of the apartheid era. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white people who sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and great joy, but has also managed to elicit a couple of tears to some that another soldier rabioso border. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey leads them always Esitjeni, where singers visiting children apadrinados. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Despite this small population barely appears in the maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> “Acércate to Esitjeni, there is the light,” says the people of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after touring the 8.733 miles in a straight line back to Heidelberg rooms to test the Bergheimer street full of singers leading the way, one realises that it is also possible to see shine his light from there. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Probably the ice has a thickness of up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The american space agency, NASA, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also water helada, as is clear from three studies published Thursday in the journal “Science” specialist. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has created a layer of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is presumably of comets or, most probably, of asteroids that collided against mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Nobody likens the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature in mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, the findings could help explain how they got water and other components of life in other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Completely unnoticed to the inhabitants of Planet Earth, the telescope probes, and small robots as “dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Occasionally send images to Earth: small windows in the vastness of space. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The image comes from a House developed by german researchers from the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term, published by the International Union astronomical in 2006 Ceres is no “planet.” </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a portrait of “family” in which appear infinite generations of stars: the oldest stars are as blue, but more difficult to recognise is the color pink stars “newborn”. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> This region of formation of stars, called a little romantic by scientists W5, was spotted by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> This image tornasolada star in extinction was taken by NASA&apos;s Spitzer telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The ring in the form of donut is composed of the material that the star spewing in its process of extinction. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> The enormous cloud Trífida, 5.4 light years from Earth, forming new stars from gas and dust. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The Spitzer telescope NASA took this photo of the training area of stellar exploitable galactic. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Pléyades, a group of stars also known by the nickname of the “seven sisters”, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> However, with the telescope can be seen better colours. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The Nebulosa of Hélice appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It sits 700 light years away in the constellation of aquarium. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarity to a continent of land has earned the nickname of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of a photograph and a normal image infrared gives rise to a spectacular color. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> This star looming could be examined in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope&apos;s infrared detectors. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Saturn and its rings: how originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> It is probably remnants of one of the windows of Saturn that disappeared without trace some 4.5 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the greatest and most precise photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxia Remolino. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Depending on the tonalidades, some images of spirals galaxies become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The image, published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebulous Trífida located several thousands of light years away in the constellation of Sagitario. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name comes from the Latin word “Trífida trifidus” (divided into three), since a dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this area of stellar formation in three lóbulos. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers could expose the indications of a banking cosmic: 400 million light years of Earth the nuclei of two galaxies merging latching the one into the other finally collided irreparably. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> This formation of stars was caught by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Not that the likes of abbreviations techniques can refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Southern. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Nebulosa Iris in the constellation of Cefeo. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebulous located 400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and 100 times smaller than that of the dust particles that can be found in a house. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was created from images of optical and X-ray made by different telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It shows a ring of black holes situated 430 million light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time of model for the Hubble space telescope NASA. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this cloud is the group of bright young stars of our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> This area of stellar training constantly produces new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In this cloud of stars, associated with the nebulous Roseta, also occur continually new star; 5,000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy brilliantly with a small black hole is still no dust, gas only. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The researchers assumed that was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found on all hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our window to the universe: the most important telescope </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei exploit it a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescope has not stopped growing and images that give us increasingly have depth. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Its mirror image, had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, US, was closed the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> This enables us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The interior of the Great telescope on the Canary Island of La Palma is enormous-only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Despite this, has a diameter of approximately 11 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of this building is more economic than the telescope has an angle of raising fixed, his mobility is limited. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of elevation. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its unusual is its enormous capacity to collect light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively smaller capacity, this is equivalent to the telescope mirror of the world&apos;s largest. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of the of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In Search of Extraterrestre” intelligence (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> The European Southern Observatory (ESO), located in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here was closed the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the spectrum infrarrojo half. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The ESO also will host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or telescope European extremely Grande). </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its primary mirror cover 42 metres and comprise a total of 1,000 reflectantes elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescope located in the volcano Mauna Kea hawaiano of were regarded as the world&apos;s largest. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> These are two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescope in Mauna Kea Observatory part alongside them, which scans the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> On Mauna Kea is planning to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of mirror of 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This is a picture of how it would be. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important information the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> From 24 April 1990 sends images of distant galaxies. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler planets extrasolares search, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of his mission had been localised 1.235 candidate planets. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the image are the last preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) not to be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The telescope&apos;s primary mirror this space has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the functions of this telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The researchers assume that in the south pole of mercury is also ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there is no solid evidence, since the probe Messenger revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> For decades the radar measurements suggest the existence of ice in mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that it is. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Drink butter daily and live 168 years </seg>
<seg id="1876"> The southern Azerbaijan many people reach age biblical. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum dedicated to longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> A search of fingerprints in a country in which people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> The southern Azerbaijan many people reach age biblical. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum dedicated to longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> A search of fingerprints in a country in which people of 97 years are still considered young. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The minibus moves with great crashing through the road that passes between the side of wooded hills, rivers of great wealth and simple houses of local farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that sits in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here to the border with Iran is just a few kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Here live “talyshi”, a people that not much is known, other than that dominate perfectly persian and Azeri and which are very ageing. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Our final destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> This small town boasts a perhaps too maciza architecture designed in the soviet era and that does not seem to fit everything in a mountainous landscape so colorful. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists barely come to this place, because the path from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is too heavy. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> To cover the 323 miles separating the two cities, needed eight hours because the road is one-way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The staggering wealth of the country thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this recóndita region. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what is to become a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> “Baku became famous in May with the conclusion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year will celebrate the festival more elderly people in the world,” says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This is the director of the Museum of Longevidad, perhaps the only one that exists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a picture in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> A your son died at the age of 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> However, there is no assurance that the departure of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And if we take into account that the oldest documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite disturbing. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> “Nació in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children. apparently still had time to conceive a child to the age of 136 years. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Has wrong then Şirali Müslümov in his age in a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> However, Rembrandt gerontólogo Scholz, the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> “In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also living people of very old,” Scholz says, “even in Sardinia there are many older men”. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age; especially when there is no civil registry. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day glasses filled with butter derretida </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> There are currently 20 people over 100 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why live here, in the south, many elderly people? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The tour guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the special genes of talyshis. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems logical that the diet rich in calories of talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, in addition, daily drink a glass of butter derretida, is so healthy. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people in Cengemiran?, a small town not far from the town of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In its 97 years is relatively young for what accordingly for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical across the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Sitting on the ground, moving tirelessly a huge tub of butter. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live under one roof, including one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also brincan from one side to the other two small children. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen preparing tea to guests, a tea served in glasses with a typical way abombada. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Teeth Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the scarf hiding two long serving trenette with dark blond hair that his son found us proud. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed his hair with milk, why I never has fallen and has maintained its colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> “I have never used a shampoo,” says Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Always has only eaten it produced in its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Throughout my life I have never gone to shopping at a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she speaks of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst was the time after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> However, he returned to his knees when the “dear” father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, in Azerbaijan, the cult that professes to the paternal figure of the nation, who runs the country as a dictator, knows no bounds. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He remained in power until 2003, when surrendered the reins to his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan does not know what is poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva claims 230 manat (roughly the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount that can live well, considering the situation here. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the son of canoso Mirzayeva is right: “in our culture the elderly are highly respected.” </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Living in a large family, loved ones, are receiving all the necessary care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> As if this were not reason enough to stay alive many years … </seg>
<seg id="1938"> In the Constitution lack the expression “Human Rights” </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Demonstrations battling each other in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous division that has gripped the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The future constitution, with Sharia law as a basis, it is very controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The egyptian president not spared pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> “We must overcome the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And that happens, it is my responsibility to the people and to God,” said on public television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was aimed at all the people, mainly Coptic Christians, Muslims are enlightened, liberal and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> All of them, immersed in a hopeless until now confused opposition, they fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> As explains Mohammed Mursi, almost asking forgiveness, has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the constitutional court and extend his power to “save the revolution”. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, neither egyptian nor the world know very well what this engineer 61 years with a PhD awarded by the University of South California wants to really save. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Is stripped of its power to the judiciary? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a late-night meeting of 15 hours&apos; duration, are truly worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in past constitutions, the draft also says that the case is based on the “principles of islamic law”. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> However, what does that mean “principles”? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and remains open to interpretation, and it seems that the Islamists will take this vague wording, as well as the margin of manoeuvre legal price, to impose a strict interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least that is what suggests a new article added: on all issues relating to the sharia is mandatory to consult the University al-Ashar, the country&apos;s largest islamic institution with a great power throughout the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> That need not be the case, but this may mean that the clergy would monitor the legislation, something that, in fact, would result in the incapacity of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> A large part of the draft constitution is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> What is also problematic is intended to keep the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator until 11 civilians were detained in military prisons. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> As the draft, the state has to protect “the true nature of the egyptian family” and “promote their morals and values.” </seg>
<seg id="1962"> It is a formula so vague in legal terms that, with the help of this article state institutions could even monitor the content of the film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Talking is not clear anything other than censure. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> For true that no article states explicitly equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> In another change prohibits insulting or defaming the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> However, it is not clear what is an offence and how to be sanctioned. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Equally problematic is the formulation that prohibits “insult to the people” </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, in his words, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians to be put to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> “The revolution has become” </seg>
<seg id="1971"> A few weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on the afternoon of Friday in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square and vowed to outplay minutes before it can come into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> “The revolution has returned, and we will overcome,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists for presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace exdirector and the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft constitution should be “in the dustbin of history.” </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Through Twitter accused supporters of Mursi to lead a “coup against democracy.” </seg>
<seg id="1976"> “When a referendum will go to his palace and derrocaremos”, says the opposition Jasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> “Even we are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiada”, was quoted in the media the egyptian political opponent Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> And several judges announced that it wanted to oversee the referendum, which would not be considered valid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> “The Koran is our constitution” </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the well-organised Muslim community appealed to celebrate a contramanifestación; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Many women are veiled and supporters of the Salafis took part in the cry: “the people demand the application of divine law.” </seg>
<seg id="1982"> Demanded Mursi to “cleanse” the country, while proclaiming: “the Koran is our constitution”. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all started, had led to a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is clear that supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something will happen. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that both those who oppose the draft constitution as supporters of the same have expressed their opinions loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should follow. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> In this sense, it appears that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> “The expression “Human Rights” does not even appear” </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced which really should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This lawyer 48 years specialising in human rights and President of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Not because sharing their ideology, but because for him the Human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> For this reason was beaten, convicted and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> “And now the expression “Human Rights” does not even appear in the new constitution,” complains in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers to Mursi of the three powers of state made this lawyer resign itself. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> The measures taken are flagrant violations of the democratic rules of the game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> “Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is to abolish it,” bemoans Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feel abandoned by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle which is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> This could turn against him. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A protestor in Tahrir Square warns: “you are not envisaging a monster that you can control.” </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The norwegian rakfisk: the more smelly fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Is it possible that the success of the country bears any relation to their greed for an extremely smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a series of overly cured cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Colóquelos amid a mountain of clothes dirty football and wet. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Let him this week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Then we can smell the aroma of paralysing rakfisk, one of the exquisiteces of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, three hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Is snowed. the scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, fleet in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The trout in salazón rakfisk is that it leaves in making wine from water during the smelly, depending on which you prefer, until a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> To measure that obscures and becoming more cold, the Norwegians come in droves to a festival, which is being held here in Fagernes, devoted to this delicacy of the most, so captivating. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> “Eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit, a pill,” says Halvarsen Havard, fireman of the city, which is also what is known as the “general Rakfisk”, who is in charge of organising the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> By all sides see people eating this fish that are observed in small buckets and drink a cup of significant quantities of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> “Some people would like more aquavit that rakfisk,” says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The beverage can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Pruebo some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid pass near the nose, is not bad; it is not very different from a piece of sushi that has travelled a few miles by bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty in Norway, before cooling, the fish scribbled during the autumn submerged in water and salt in secretive barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Later, in winter, when it is already well fermented, lifts, and obviously with the ways inactive due to alcohol, eats. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Only a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to abandon their country in search of work, and mainly emigrated to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today, the population is rising rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, higher wages and a comprehensive system of social services. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and so not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although fairly smelly, last of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It is among the most expensive dishes that you can buy. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But, in fact, everything is expensive. a rod of beer or a sandwich you cost to the tune of €10 ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegians would like that to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here people is still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist that acribilló shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, relate to the shooting as “the event of 22 July.” </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have trouble believing that much in its placid country one of theirs would be capable of committing such cruelty and homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> After much of the wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970&apos;s, one of the oil and gas industries in the world&apos;s largest. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> “But the oil is not the only reason why we are going so well,” says Anna, our camarera, while passes trays rakfisk and which, with its long melena blonde and their striking blue eyes, is the image of the norwegian welfare. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> “We are, as you say, people cautious.” </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like the majority of people in this country, is impeccable. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> “We do not like to boast, dislike the ostentation.” </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> While everyone was dissipating money that was not in the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed well. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> “While we can skiers in winter and hikers in summer, we are happy,” says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> “And eat rakfisk”, he adds with a casual laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am in the snow queuing to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Now a hamburger of elk is certainly something different and quite roaring to savour. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But by the evening, again this smelly fish. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I host is one of many local in which is hosting a dinner of rakfisk where diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the most tested the graves nasales. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> Television has connected directly with a presenter who leads bow tie and is surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It seems the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> “What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?” </seg>
<seg id="2046"> “Here is our punctuation, Havard.” </seg>
<seg id="2047"> There is laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls chair, perhaps overcome by aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps the vapours that whole fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto will be facing a hard start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña grandson, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of its population. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already so congested, has been installed since Monday a ring of steel that short several main roads leading to the city and that is causing considerable chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal, however, was not prevent workers could arrive at their place of work, but avoid the protesters could come to Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Peña Nieto will receive, the presidential sash and assume management of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Faces a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is involved in a war against narcotráfco that has already killed some 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> “My government has a strong commitment to the mexican people to reduce the violence,” explained Mr. Peña grandson earlier this week by US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> “I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.” </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before hobnobbing with the US President, prior political experience of Mr Peña was as governor of his home state, Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A populous state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; the views on the new leader are divided into this territory where he used to move. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> An honest man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valley Bravo, for example, recalls with affection. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Its residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and building infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To reach the city can lead by one of the new roads of Mr Peña grandson, which is a huge improvement compared with roads agrietadas and full of potholes that were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> They can also see plates with his name on the entry of a modern polideportivo and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> “We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Peña grandson, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> “Particularmente, in terms of safety and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.” </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After a period of uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The MEP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of the Pinos, within the party there are many expectations of Enrique Peña Nieto will. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Also rejects the rating that the opposition&apos;s lack of essence of the new President. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> “He is a man very honest, very committed and an excellent view of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a fantastic man, and above all, is someone who knows how to listen.” </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has many people on their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as city Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valley Bravo could not be higher. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under stretches of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems of the community are also tough and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the slums and violence against women is particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a desert area, located next to a heap of rubbish, have been left abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of women killed. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Peña grandson was the governor, a far higher rate than Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately, famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with killing of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Peña grandson say, in the best of cases, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a house of concrete, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buendía must make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of their deceased daughter, Mariana moon. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believes that the murdered his partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> “When I came home, it seemed as if it had been cleaned up the body,” recalls Mrs Buendía. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> “There are signs that had been hit and the rigour of death” had already emerged.” </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross which read a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> “The authorities of the country I have been treated as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> What they want is one simply accept what they say and street.” </seg>
<seg id="2092"> “But this cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and such negligence,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> The presidential sash that President Peña grandson receive Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years, and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> “I hope that is the same sort of president who was when I was governor,” says Mr PRI Olvera in Valley Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of city Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning not reported mistreatment, according to prosecutors </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to cope with complaints of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial focuses on the period of Manning in the military prison in Quantico in Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier&apos;s army is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in american history, missed multiple opportunities to denounce abuse now alleges that suffered while he was under arrest military. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During interrogation that the prosecutor made to Manning in a pre-trial at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the records of visits weekly official of the unity that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The interrogations, which took place during a hearing at the request of the defense of the entire case since his incarceration had been tough and that it already had enough punishment, of course, came a day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while he was detained. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning forms that officers by after visits to Manning during his detention at the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in solitary confinement maximum from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Officers have asked questions to Manning and noted their answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When asked on Friday Fein forms, Manning acknowledged that had described the treatment that gave him the celadores as “excellent” and the treatment received in installations in general as “very professional”. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms show no complaint of mistreatment, despite the fact that the official asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns about certain issues and that the officers that I visited had talked about these problems and I had indicated that begins, but they left no record of these issues in the register. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> “Escribían “without incidences” (after having talked of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem,” said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked why Manning had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a Council commissioned to examine the intentions of suicide that was expressed in a form months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of “prevention of injury” under which it was. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that she had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is one level below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their safety and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> “I wanted the Staff knew that I was well and (wanted) to be under prevention of injury … to be able to enjoy that, from my point of view, it is a better quality of life,” said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait, and that on one occasion lost knowledge due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He said the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going on or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> “My world fell only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> “Creí that was going to die in that cage.” </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Manning said that once moved to Quantico, spent the most days in a small cell, at least during 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said that he was only allowed to have a cushion, a blanket, a chancletas, some clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lying down during the day. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning said that always had a light from outside aiming their eyes while sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> He said that if the celadores could not see the face when the return at night, woken to return to turn around. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer for Manning presented in January 2011 a formal complaint about the treatment he received Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning was moved to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge asked Manning on an allegation that had been made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, a night after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he forced a recount during morning to stand in front of the desdnudo celadores and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he was never given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During questioning by the judge Friday, Manning said that deducted by the order that gave him the prison guard to drop the blower with which could have been covered, but acknowledged that nobody had ordered that the dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous evening because of an attempt to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that he had told the official that could have used the elastic of his underwear or their chanclas for self-harm but that he had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell their underwear, their chanclas and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge will at least consider the experience of what happened during their stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if convicted in the council of war, which is scheduled to begin early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense claimed that intends to make Manning is guilty of minor crimes and defend other allegations considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The view is expected to resume this weekend and it is expected that prosecutors argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules apply to all detainee who was found under maximum custody in Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, provoking illegally the publication of information on the Internet, to leak information to national defense and theft of public property or records. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If convicted of all charges, could face life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My identity crisis Mexican-american </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to criticise those who were; he says that recall the Mexicans in those difficult times </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had dropped below the Dome and reached the area of handling of immigration and was totally confused. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Some posters showing the path towards two lines: one for “Mexicans” and another for “Foreign Nationals”. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was there a few seconds without being sure where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Having grown up in Central California, throughout my life I have called “mexican”. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> This is taquigrafía ethnic, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “irish” or my friends in New York they describe themselves as the “italian”. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I decided to “mexican-american.” </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, in the land of my grandfather, taquigrafía or scripts were not needed. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> Simply was american. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak spanish. well enough and manejarme during an interview in this language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and cannot get rid of my american accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my american passport and I started at the bottom of foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time this week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto will visit the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda, as always, to meet the leaders of those two countries, pages: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Peña grandson was willing to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, one of the reasons that at the moment it is just as likely that a mexican stay in Mexico as they venture to go to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> Wants to be associated with the United States and Canada in North America and create a trade bloc in the style of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, Peña Nieto will promised to continue fighting against the drug cartels in Mexico, but gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 America invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of its territory at gunpoint. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans, who believe in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are the reminders are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So, when a United States official says anything that involves the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the elite mexican, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Moctezuma are put on a war footing. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million mexican-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Is talk of grudge? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There is quite a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why there are so many people of mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, San Antonio, “or is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, it may be that the father or mother or any of the grandparents, she closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to march towards the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And most of the time the person fit into a certain profile: skinned, a low level of education, from a poor people, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their top-down and they are loyal. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Mexico is not. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And, despite that perhaps we are now living the american dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are seeing is that the american dream, and not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is what it is. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It is to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite class leader not gustamos. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over the shoulder as if it were a lower status that is not sufficiently mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now, we would not be trapped behind this smokescreen of silk, living well in the United States, but even so, as a solitary souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know with more strength and who are the seconds that resents. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are part of one of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love to hear the group Mexican tigers North, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You have the best of each country, but are not rooted in any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico see us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States considers Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to complicate matters further, by what I learned during my trip, some mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexican-Americans work as “ambassadors” of Mexico makeshift, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We say to our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen its ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course … </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That is not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with the wage inequality, corruption and rampant violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I fear that you will be alone with this idea, friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive America for the manner in which they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then you have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still smarting from how they treated their family much less time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps be more “mexican” than thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis for peace unlikely </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will some day have a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Further bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the pointless and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have fallen near the metropolis of Tel Aviv, Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in your old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has left shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been stuck in the regional uproar. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this makes his fight to be even bloodier than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons to think that its lethal stalemate could desencallarse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is neither loses or wins </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the optimism currently looks very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, the clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite that Gaza has received a good kicking. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite having killed some of their leaders and got pressure on 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to crush Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other palestinian side currently governed by their bitter rivals Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that the time is playing in his favour. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the arab world, Hamas has made friendships rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. also has made Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic in the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The jubilant Hamas members say that the islamic crescent is surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, where the party dominates-militia Hezbollah via Syria, where rebels a trend increasingly islamist could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where the allies Hamas are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and key arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its demise in 2011, it took too long for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins brothers of Hamas and its leaders depend more on popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic action, it is possible that Hamas emerges as the protagonist cannot be excluded, or even Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the wing Israel will draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In the military, have put Hamas in its place. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The anti-missile system of iron apex of Israel has proved its effectiveness, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis dormirán happier … for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many european countries also blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a Prime Minister who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have upended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that dissolves the West Bank, the main chunk of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the jewish settlements that are still rising despite the fact that, according to international law, are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud Party has joined a group of an even harsher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, is in a good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why coddling those clever giving Palestinians their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If really ruled in the West Bank, does not dispararían rockets as did his compatriots in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to have after this wall and give them a good blow if rose to head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the wing hard, although the Arab Spring could upset their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although islamists to take power in Egypt and elsewhere are not too dear to Israel, their priority is to tackle internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is greater than their four arab neighbors together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire is a good omen, and could mark the start of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should think long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world, becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox that one day it will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state and demographics worsens the situation as it increases the arab population. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas pay a toll diplomatic growing. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a nudge from people outside the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution remains the touting sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and ceding territory by Israel for security reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire to give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which should start to curb the entry of weapons in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would contribute more to the creation of a palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual statehood at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in that regard to bring Israel to the negotiating table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term failed to submit its own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Once in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A Middle East stability is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The law of generic packaging of tobacco comes into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packets of a dark green colour, which are the same for all brands of tobacco </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The australian law on tobacco packaging and generic, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the stitched and colors of brands for a packet of a dark green olive, a frightening images of body parts with diseases and representations of sick babies and children to be children of smoking parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> With the exception of the various images and warnings, the only difference between the packs, compulsory since Saturday, are the names of brands, all of them printed in a kind of small source. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the world of the stricter regime applied to the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia says that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit has glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Relying on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the 26 years, there is a 99% chance that we will never do. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> “You can see that children, even from a very early age, to understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their brand,” said Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed how, for example, girls do the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Despite that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and that these changes will not greatly affect the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The tobacco companies argued that the law would promote the black market for tobacco, cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> “The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco, in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Increase the amount of tobacco that bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Other people say that their business has benefited after the passage of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for pitilleras and covered with silicone to plug the unpleasant images of packets had skyrocketed almost from scratch just two months ago, when the british American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Mrs. Zico has stated that he sold to 6,000 units to establishments wholesalers and was expecting more stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> “For us it is good business.” </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between demographic directed the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of australian laws which prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of tobacco has to be last in line. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned Internet advertising companies and local websites, but cannot restrict in foreign pages. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> “If comercializas tobacco and just you is this small window to promote your products, the online space is the place to be in the more convincing,” said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman noted an increase of reviews on brands from “ordinary citizens” published on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> One wonders whether this is just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any company marketing is behind all this. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The british American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new rules mean that in marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It is likely that the WTO issued a resolution in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws apply in terms of packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce compulsory include images on cigarette packets. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Currently they are compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> In Australia, many smokers are defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> “The photographs will not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> We simply do not have.” </seg>
<seg id="2293"> “The cigarette Coges and guards the package,” says Victor the Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumour in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> “Frankly, there is only one reason why that would stop smoking: for my daughter.” </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, CEO of watertight King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, indicates that the packets uniform make it more complicated place on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> “Usually took an hour in desenvalar delivery; now four very quick,” says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> “The government should be completely banned smoking and then, is already, it is over and we closed the shop,” says while closed hands upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world that is constantly connected, it is not so bad a little aburrirse </seg>
<seg id="2299"> During the festivities of the day of action thanks this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had plenty of time to think about the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is rather dull, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly academics and experts in child development that praises the virtues of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, it is good that both we and our children, we aburramos from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Aburrirse forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Given that, currently, the majority of us are connected to this or that screen, not experiencing the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So, should we accept in good spirits boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But it later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, like many people, meant that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book “Boredom: a Lively History” (“the boredom, an animated history”) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> “In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating from the first century A.D. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We must also consider how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> “The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examining the published research and raise the idea before a focus group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desired, but not power, participate in an activity that you full.” </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Says that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> That apathy says there is no desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the disruption of the process of care, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly.” </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom may sound shockingly similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood says that, though they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem is with them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we feel we are bored, when what happens in reality is that we have problems to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study “the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention”, published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person who read the article in a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups listened in the room adjoining a television programme to all volume that bore no relation, others listened to the volume low, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio in no time. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The group that heard the programme with the volume low boredom showed more than the other two groups; cost them concentrate, but were not sure why and attributed the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> “When you are trying to pull concentrarte in a difficult task or interesting, altering the attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Neurociencia Fenske, professor of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> “On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts on a production line, a music that you distract you can help not aburrirte.” </seg>
<seg id="2329"> “In fact, we know today that move or make garabatos, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help combat, because that makes that person is physically more alert.” </seg>
<seg id="2330"> “Research shows that those children who are allowed to move to learn more and have more information than those who are being forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all know what is aburrirse sometime: the delay of a plane, a dull speaker, a film especially boring. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people have more of a tendency to aburrirse than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s, a trend the “scale of boredom.” </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale covers issues such as “many of the things we do have are repetitive and dull” and “there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do everything.” </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more tendency to aburrirse more often than girls, and in particular need more external stimulation and more varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that bothers quite easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human development and Community at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which it was in contact with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Found that 32 per cent of teenagers said that while I was bored in school or doing homework, while 23 per cent said they were bored when I was at school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, the 3 per cent of parents said that they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he said that what we knew was that “adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest levels”, largely because both children and adolescents are not giving them a great control on what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, going back to my question of principle: is it a good aburrirse? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, because, taken to extremes, can make us expose absurd physical risks, such as gambling or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat, as research shows. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, claims Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> “The boredom is the way that the brain to say that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and use that energy to touch the guitarra or cooking, that will satisfy you. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you notice the television, it is possible that you meet in the short term, but in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> “So, if your son is boring and give him an iPad, it may no longer be aburra, but not have learned to entertain itself or to dosificarse”, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> “And this capacity dosificarse applies to other situations,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns to not only entertain alone, but learns to better control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we really want to praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But we should not be too critical of him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of the persistent rumour activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> “In our view, we need more tiresome, but the boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing as to link it with something that deserves the death penalty,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Points out that what people are really looking for is a way to shut down and enjoy a long dead. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> “In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados”, says, “it is difficult to find ways of focusing our attention when the noise stops.” </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: no book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, a student of 19 years in a Community Institute and footballer in southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of stones of marijuana and a pipe that used to fumarla. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco says that a September day, he and some friends led by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when stopped by the police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> “They treat us like criminals,” says Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> And what are they? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for possession of drugs depends less on the law of location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are canceling both here and in the state of Washington, which approved a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police departments have failed to file charges against those aged 21 years for possession of small-scale, which is legally approved once the law comes into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in more conservative districts in Colorado have been committed to proceed with cases open for marijuana possession and are still quoting people. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent opening stores, recently authorized marijuana in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> “All this is changing so rapidly that I do not know what will be next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington also are pussy-footing around. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> And still seeking advice for establishing a licensing system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales; all this before the deadline, 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that, for good or for ill, Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first with terapeúticos purposes and now for recreational use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> “Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Commission control of alcohol in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> “There is no real precedent that will serve as a model,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also makes a year during which nadará between two stools, since the licensing system in this state still exist, but the possession is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Besides, there are some mechanical sensitive issues that must be resolved during this period, as the way to keep a balance between the demands of the state to offer a “proper access” to the authorized marijuana and its ban on conducting business in a radius of cannabis less than 300 metres of schools, parks, areas of game or child-care centres. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> “No place is more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorised in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for cannabis legal, a research group created recently. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to its police officers where they reported that the prosecutor for the city fail to prosecute minor offences for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years and the police fail to bring charges against those crimes “with immediate effect”. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief Oates said that they should be in charge of enforcing the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that still chasing drug smugglers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, assured that his office still pursuing cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and to receive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, even though many of them have other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> “Our office has the obligation to bring prosecutions against those mistakes that occurred were crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The response has been complicated, even in places like the rural county table, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer quotation to adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hautzinger, County, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> “I do not believe that it is losing time to continue enforcing the law until this change,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite that 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, never considered that the consumption of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The contradictory reactions that occur throughout the state show a sharp ambivalence among officials about the large green experiment in this state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> “This is a cultural barrier with the tax district,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants for possession of marijuana that is local and spokesman of the National Organisation for the reform of the law on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> “Han spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, still cannot accept that it is legal,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> To be the first states that consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if it was alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases nationally in terms of the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also looking forward to receiving information from the federal government, which still provides the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will subside. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Although there have been some arrests of prominent patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed in their majority there business of selling marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> “It is likely that the agents drugs not pull down doors to confiscate a bag of drugs small, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of stores regulated by the state, so the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor drugs policy of the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado are not waiting to act the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite that happen around a year before any of them can open. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely to approve the next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> “We do not want to put ourselves in a situation where the license to someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> “Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are studying in favour of what the community voted against voting in favour of what the state voted.” </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions arise. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: “I harassed until down Oxford to be a Tory” </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Not attacking the university for their views only now </seg>
<seg id="2408"> I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming in getting a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had been in which I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a symposium greek contemporary was promoting the two pillars of civilisation: the free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks ago to take my place in the Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the career of history, had already packed their bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and started weeping. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were bemused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard said that I had abandoned because brooked no that some fellow university maintained sexual relationships in the room next door. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer A.N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I forced to drink in cups desconchadas. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Huí there. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, huí, because she had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my quirky name, nor the fact that it had come from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I harassed by a single reason, in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> You may wonder what is it now. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students right-of-center is suffering a similar prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The institutionalised hatred and growing toward the students of the Conservative Party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them demanding the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the JCR (grouping students in degree of Corpus Christi College) claim it is “often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as undesirables” for their political ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to create a seat on the committee of equal opportunities for your college university to make sure they can express their views freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by a recent documentary BBC2 called “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the right” (Paradise: young, bright and right) on the policy of students and portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Showing the graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a suit and a silver stick with empuñadura silver. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students conservatives say that they are treated as “scapegoats” for the introduction of higher tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, of 20 years and vice-chairman of the Association of Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know.” </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, of 21 years old and a student of history in Corpus Christi who tabled the motion for greater protection, says that this is “uncomfortable”, while Stephanie Cherill, aged 19 and elected president of OUCA, argues that the attitude of the JCR towards people who are right-of-center has worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> “This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> During my first weeks in Oxford was more than a single. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I arrived at the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old terribly timid. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its peak. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, an honorary title “cause” after cuts in funding for higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere had done shudder of horror to any stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> Already during the first days of the week to welcome the new university, when the new students are known and familiar to the professors, received a sample of the bitterness that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The professors found that not only did the blind eye to the derision of the university that was conservative, but participated in it willingly. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The policy of the miners&apos; strike, privatisation and the government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached rooms of timber seminar. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first was to translate into English, french texts of the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what followed. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> “Señorita Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “Please, translates the first paragraph”. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Di or not. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a man with a face that seemed bajito mass bizcocho, knew well how to eject bad seven. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> “How is that thatcheristas refuse to learn french or is that, simply, are stupid?” he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other university laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I compared the eyes of the tears that was contained. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> “I suggest you go to french classes in their free time, if and when it is not too busy knowing people,” gruñó Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to my room as a soul in worth. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at the university; then I felt a gentle pat on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> I was a student of English in second year called James was presented as a member of OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> “I know who you are,” I said helpfully. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> “I fear that as is the thing. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> They pick on anyone who is suspected to be Tory. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour.” </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, tried to conceal a cowardly. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that he did not agree with everything he said Mrs. Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick proved useless. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student of philosophy, Políticas and Economy, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “you are a pig daughter of fascist. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated.” </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students took this ditty. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I became the dirty perverted. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> “How have sex the Tories?” asked one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> “Give a beating each other, isn&apos;t it?” </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt the same way that ought to have been gay before the law liberal in the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I will be forced to be with people who thought as I just after dusk? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Would that make Labour and repress my natural tendencies? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that I hoped to be posed as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history for my college education. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> I odiaban for being not just of the Conservative Party but also of Thatcher adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was barely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He detested the place that they considered parochial and insignificant and by his adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> “You are going to be happy,” he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I began to travel daily Oxford home my parents in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan mindset more open. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> When he studied there in the 1940s, were accepted all the political points of view. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> “But if it is the best place in the world,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> “They never do that, not there between my dear needles dream. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Until my communist friends always had a faultless attitude.” </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His eyes began to their great sadness nublarse. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> “Dale another opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure that they did so only to joke. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> I reduced the heart if dejaras.” </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced their creed. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The following week, at a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people”, decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Red embarrassment inside, admití my parents I had “brainwashed” and called them “old stupid.” </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The truce lasted a short time. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Then my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was within acurrucada of fear and, after five minutes, my tormentor desistieron. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they were made the suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Perhaps I llaméis weak llorona. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But any person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hiding behind a reputation deserved nothing of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> “Mr Valentino prefers elegance visibility” </seg>
<seg id="2502"> With the shows “Mr Valentino: Master of the costura”, which was unveiled this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clientas of italian designer </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the british capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Mr Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The designer has acknowledged during the opening of “Mr Valentino: Master of the costura,” a retrospective apoteósica gathers more than 130 dresses at created by its “maison” during the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> “Adoro this palace,” says with his unmistakable italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This show is the pinnacle of a history whose single player is “il Mr Garavani”, but that could not have been written without their distinguished clientas. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Mr Valentino has always fascinated by the tense and distant world of nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until next March 3, private letters and photos with the signing of the cream of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, via the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Mr Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of their upward: humble fashion city of Voghera, in northern Italy, the heartthrob of “jet-set internationally.” </seg>
<seg id="2510"> To be in love with the royals, there is nothing wrong with that. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> “At least not apagan the cigarette butts of their pitillos on your wonderful carpet as some beautiful celebrities of pop music,” says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Mr Valentino is hosting a spectacular and talking with generosity and grace. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> “We all loved to be invited to his villa in Gstaad,” explains the exmujer “Heini” Thyssen, intimate beauties of forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Mr Valentino has always preferred elegance to the notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And yet, is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, donning a Mr Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forgets the charisma of fashion. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Many years ago, after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, went to dinner at his flat. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> There were 20 people, who were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In every detail of the apartment, decorating, food, music, all we saw and felt his spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> “Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, which began to work with him during the week of Upper costura Paris, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> “Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art,” lid. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Parade alcurnia </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but loves well matched. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves the people with good education and better titles, and they love him. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a catwalk glamurosa 60 metres long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and paraded in the passageway to contemplate a “hearing” dream that adorned with masterpieces of Mr Valentino, as the clothing that chose Jackie Kennedy for his wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that used Monica Vitti in “La Notte”, or a wool coat and shoes that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> In this public mannequins relucen names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and fashion, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of these clientas say that the first Mr Valentino is like first love, “impossible to forget.” </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember it well. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a proof “gillette” and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> “It was a gift that I did it,” says Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> “I prefer him above others for their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Show. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like very much the colours that used, are very light and are “donors” to the side. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The Princess and prescriptora fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d&apos;Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time dressed in a Mr Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age and the opportunity to use one of their costumes at night … </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally it came at the end of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first Mr Valentino dress for use at a party at the house of my cousin, Prince of Edouard Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a red suit, with skirt volados, “corsage” drapeado gardens and word of honour. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> “It was a dream come true,” says the widow of Rodrigo d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> “Mr Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this italian aristocracy who live between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Princess d&apos;Arenberg observed dresses of feast of fashion with “maximum care … because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the whole of memories that entails.” </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The “king” of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand finale of the exposure of Somerset House is the girlfriend of Marie-Chantal Miller in his wedding with Paul Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 “ragazze” (as it calls the fashion their seamstresses) to produce this colour ivory silk dress encrusted with pearls, 12 different types of lace and a queue of four and a half metres. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, highest authority of the specialist press, the dress represents a milestone of the end of the 20th century, “the return of the clientas of high society”. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obnubilado for years with the “know - être” elite, now Mr Valentino is the best example. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of most senior in Italy), the Cavaliere Lavoro, Commandeur de L&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani amassed many honours as any of their husbands clientas. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> “I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, pulcro and perfect,” acknowledges d&apos;Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw was a month ago at a dinner event at the Orsay museum. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> “It was flawless, the time is not for him.” </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it says a princess … </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: the human mules Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> By four, the porters of indonesian volcano is risking their life and health saddle 70 kilos of sulphur through empinados pathways of stone </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom his work is a hell and another, literally, working in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> In the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living photographing sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> To this end, it down every day until the bottom of the crater, where the gas sulphur emanating from the bowels of the earth congeals and solidifies to come into contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After tearing large rocks of sulphur, which in total come despite some 70 kilograms, leaves in two baskets of bamboo that burden on your shoulders through escarpados pathways of stone. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which amounts to 2.4 metres altitude, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to reach tortoise, observing and measuring the balance with its measured steps to not resbalarse and falling off the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that any blunder could cost them their lives, as happened to a french tourist despeñó years ago by the Ijen riscos Kawah. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur mining </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once on top, break through the tourists fotografían as if they were monkeys circus and laboriously, leaving the heavy baskets, walk three miles until the balance that a mining company has placed a little lower, at EUR 1.85 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and never better said, their employees, which pays indonesian 662 rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture cerillas, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whitewash the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> “As is normal load 70 kilograms, get some 46,000 rupees (3.8 million) on every journey,” explains Anto, who usually make three portes daily. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Takes three hours in each and has just lost, but allow him to pool 138 000 rupees (11.5 million) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it seems a pittance to inhumane effort, is triple what gain in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> “The Jornal of miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees ($1.2 million) a day, and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 million),” clarifies the porteador, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75 rupees (6.2 million) per day and the Tagus was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia, is as strong as the sulphur: “married with a young woman from Bali, where Hindus, and have brought to Java to turn to Islam.” </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes for toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Its 27 years, Anto has three played the game at the Ijen Kawah sulphur, which has already begun to pass bill despite the face covered with a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes of toxic gases that dismisses the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price we must pay to achieve his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> “I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or studying spanish or french” in English, promises a more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished for life, this nice young and intelligent could be tour guide, waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead makes the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, was closed each day at two in the morning because the sulphur is flowing at night, when its distinctive blue and yellow colour becomes shines amid the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the shadows, Anto low at alumbrándose crater with a small pocket torch stuck to its hull, which he bought with his money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 porters carry baskets of sulphur on his shoulders from the bottom of the crater </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulphur to save costs or any equipment supplied to the porters, who work for his account and therefore the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, even being part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 million) surcharge for House, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 million), the guards this natural park charged to tourists who come to expose the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> “This work is for the animals and not to the people,” a protest Madrusin fornido porteador 42 years it has been in Kawah Ijen three decades, since leaving school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, ensures that aguantará working “all it can” because it needs the money to educate their three children between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur burned the eyes and throat rankles when the wind is changing rapidly and locks the miners in the thick columns from the volcano, are so severe that none complained of suffering serious illness … beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, artrosis, pain in the knees and sores in the shoulders, which have been malformado by the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balanceando basket on their backs, Unainik can only charge 50 kilos of its 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his colleagues removed 15 tonnes of sulphur, the volcano that three lorries transporting the warehouse Tamansari, 18 miles away by a goat path between the undergrowth. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> “I retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of their five children, more than 30 years ago, also works carrying sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the misery perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: that make the human mules of Kawah Ijen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore seeks babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The singapurenses blame the race, the stress and the cost of properties and education for not having children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> “The population of Singapore needs grow.” </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband patriotic, you are my wife, patriotic fulfil our civic duty and we believe life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an announcement of pellets of mint, but despite-or perhaps because of-the video that went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references as “going to put a bao (roll) in the oven” to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that the announcement will draw attention to the problem of a playful manner. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of the music for people to comply with its “national duty.” </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is a purely Internet, so we had to do fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the world&apos;s worst in reproducirnos ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that had to be addressed. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as perfume launch with feromonas or organise parties quotations (quick speed-dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas can be creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why not do more creative as possible to solve this problem, which is putting together a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The not-so lightly is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Spends $1,300 per year in policies to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for marriages and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich city state and high-tech in south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its division of the national population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2-known as rate-was reinstated in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why the singapurenses do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> As Wei Ming, Director of policies Matrimonio and Family Division National population, says that is due to a “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.” </seg>
<seg id="2617"> “That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities in life, beyond getting married and starting a family,” explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to increased soltería, and delaying marriage and birth, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy should tip to drastically increase immigration to confront the declining population has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites rife with barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticised for keeping wages low and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for that last year the Singapore government experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the election, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with quotas and charging higher for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unintended consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, the income tax, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government tries to not be built so many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority of urban development has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as “shoebox”, which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These flats are areas of 46 square metres and have been very successful sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of soltería and discourage developers who want to build houses, large family. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the company building the Developers, says that its “boxes of shoes” sold much faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Are more popular, in the sense that the units are dwindling days, even weeks, faster than the larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This makes it much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too distressed </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the birth rate national talk with singapurenses working in the district&apos;s financial centre, it seems, is not going to have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> “People are very stressed, houses are expensive and also is education, so many people are postponing,” says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> “But it is important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man of 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mentioned his career, the stress and the cost of properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as much as the government tries to push their citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, singapurenses are those who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The private off-line is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy is the quality of private or “area of privacy, which is entitled to protect any intrusion.” </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is private for a less than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How true this definition in their daily lives and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Do they understand the risks to which it is exposed to ventilate the Internet in situations that may not share out of line? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> ElPeriódico interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, involving the term “something very mine”, on a personal level, and “in the name of the user and key”, when applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> “My deepest secrets not rise to a post,” says Jorge, ten years ago, when trying to explain the meaning of private at sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> “They are secret very secret, my mum could meet them, but not the entire world,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> Subo francs in beautiful images or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I also entretengo with my acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> “Do not share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is doing the ridiculous,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The baby recognises that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write humiliating comments or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures know 35 friends in francs and its nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> Opened Twitter to speak and write tweets interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> “I do not know if I answered, I only subo”, he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> “Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> No hesitation in replying that he would never accept a request from an unnamed person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Nor would do if someone that I recommend to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admits not knowing to 20 people aggregate in your list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> “I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, none has been hinted nor has it asked the direction of your home or your telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> “If I pressured or I would just draw from my account,” acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José became a follower of Ask, then read a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boy did not fall outside the experience of what is now known as ciberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A known for my friend were gouged in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> “I never knew who he was,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, not closed the account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> “We only made privacy.” </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then explains a number of steps to shape the account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike George, this boy rise photos of acquaintances in awkward situations or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> It would, if you fall ill or have been lacking. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> “Even though I know that this is ciberbullying”, says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos truncheons, teacher of English and a degree in education and learning, believes that guide for children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social networks is reporting. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> “The Internet has emerged as a means to seek information, but with the aparecimiento these sites have changed the rules of the game,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Truncheons notes that the academic Marc Prensky, master&apos;s degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the natives and digital immigrants, these terms coined to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives are children and young people who were born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> “We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Now the issue is complex, “because we are asking to have a defined criteria on what should or should not distribute, publish or say to an age that maturity is not for that.” </seg>
<seg id="2687"> “Also to be selective when what matters most to them is popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” it adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> “Tell them that does not use,” he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, truncheons lists some options: there are things that would not contarías to a strange, why you do on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, do you like to publish a photo of you as publicaste a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When photos of party labels, pediste permission to other people to tag them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And more, is all they need to know what you are doing every time? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to see that must act online as off-line. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> “One outside Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, like must be in social networks,” says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Guard Estuardo, university professor, professor of primary and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read to awareness policies of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> To understand each of the stages they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> “For example, the age and what is permitted to share or publishing,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to guard, it is key to remember the lesson of children “not hables with strangers.” </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The Unasur summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The VI Summit presidential suramericana Union Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without issued the declaration Lima announced previously and supposedly signed by the seven leaders assistants. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed in the VI ordinary meeting of heads of state and government of the Unasur, but sources Chancellery and presidency noted in a start that he was to be delivered after the closing, but later claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> To be consulted by the text, pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The access of journalists to the information from the summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day only delivered, in the press room, the video without sound of the House presidential with the message “private session, audio restricted.” </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by the spokesmen press some of the governments of the Unasur attending the meeting, although not the peruvian. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document circulated during the day was the list of presidents assistants, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from different national and international calling for greater data. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, Peru&apos;s presidency, sent an e-mail to the media with the “final statement” of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was the host of the Summit III South America-the Arab (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite being pressed repeatedly by the press, nor spread the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In both international events, the peruvian authorities have worked on transmission systems insured for all journalists but limited the maximum obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the court in the Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the meeting regional and testified that respected the decision of the (ICJ), which begins Monday in the Hague to hear arguments from both sides, the process that Lima presented against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> “We shall abide by the judgment and ejecutaremos that defines the differences that today we are engaged in this court,” said Humala, together with its chilean couple. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> “Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,” added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents are subject to the ICJ happened then that Colombia this week denounced the pact that Bogota had agreed to submit to the failures of the international court, then a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua considered seriously wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held with inasistencias presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay suspended Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host, President Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The agent read the final document in which reported that took 16 agreements and set guidelines for 31 projects between the south american countries for a total of $17 billion in investments. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted mentioned that the UNASUR countries take “important steps towards the goal of a south american citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence.” </seg>
<seg id="2725"> Reported to drive actions to enhance “cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and against organised crime, transnational actions to make medicines more affordable, the Internet access at low prices in all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficient the risks of natural disasters.” </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) must not be a parent triumphalist but must serve to extend nustra parent productive and look forward to a better future for our peoples,” added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> “We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and borders … joining our countries and generating new economic cycles,” said the Peruvian President in a message read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among those projects, said that five correspond to Peru, and funding is located in the horizontal axes of its territory, from the coast into Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> “We hope that the electoral process in this country for their return to the Union of South American Nations”, which are currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America is maintained as a region of peace and prosperity, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting their participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, Saturday in Mexico to discuss in respectful manner the maritime dispute after a failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> “Tomorrow (Saturday) it may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> “We are going to review all these paths, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he emphasized. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> “President Ortega hope to be able to say that we handle this the more civilized and respectful as possible,” added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Saints and Ortega was found Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takes command of that country&apos;s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto will. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Also, as part of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers met prior to approving the plan of action by the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay in UNASUR, although the latter is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency pro témpore of regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> “South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship”: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in that “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe.” </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, told state tv that the Europeans “are killed in the Second World War” and other conflicts, “but are now virtually a homeland.” </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing citizenship suramericana encouraging member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> “We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers by any country suramericano, as already happens with members of the Andean Community, but there are still sectors reactionaries who want us back to the past,” he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian President was, moreover, in favour of the rearrangement of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and take account of those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The professorship will never commit to anything and, instead, we we signed all of South America. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> “It is incomprehensible that the Inter-american Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of America,” he said in reference to the political asylum by Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that is not regretted that decision because this has not betrayed their principles, but that he respected their “deep democratic values and human rights.” </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that, at the time, had “justified suspicions that Assange be extradited to a third country, and is not respected its process.” </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Criticised, in addition to the swedish justice demand that it be put in its territory to questioning by an alleged sex crime when “the swedish law allows conducted by videoconference, that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> “I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that I had a small problem lung, nothing serious,” said the leftist Ecuadorean. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is the danger that his deteriorating physical and mental health by being locked up in a small space, without being able to do exercises outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> “That complicates the health of any person,” he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the ecuadorean embassy in London, by granting a salvaconducto that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the european legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the WikiLeaks founder. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> “The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the european legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different european bodies,” said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And opined that “if Britain gives the pass is just this morning.” </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as well as allowing their legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogated Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or mulling via Skype tomorrow is just this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took to assert itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and explained that what is “not tolerated mediocrity, bad faith and the lie, which infringe the freedom of expression.” </seg>
<seg id="2761"> “The greatest enemies of press freedom are not political evil and wicked but bad journalists depending on the profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In that aspect was pleased that no longer are these journalists “neither bankers nor hegemons and bourgeois who dominate Ecuador”, and anticipated to be renominated to “deepen the revolution to continue along the path and the right direction.” </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until their next elections by arguing that the body “must be firm and will not tolerate the opportunism and the act of subversion thrive legality” because in reality “shattered the legitimacy of the paraguayan democracy.” </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian President also found “perfectly appropriate” the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> It now accepts that ruling. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a country South American and Central American one. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are inevitable, but must be overtaken by the desire to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We prosecute them broadly to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Also confided in a good conclusion to the proceedings by maritime boundaries that keep the same court in Peru and Chile, and opined that “is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries are committed to accept failure that is hard.” </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the eventuality that is presented as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term pointed out that sees this possibility “with great joy and optimism, although it is sometimes quite hard.” </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if it loses the election in February of 2013 will be withdrawn from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> In the staff never interested me power, but in situations as unfair as the Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> “My movement pólitico believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept this reponsabilidad,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Winning it would be my last stint in the presidency and hence out of public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> “This is a decision,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also referred to the new treatment of health of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just spoken with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which waited to move the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> “Does not mean a relapse in the health of President Chavez,” he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of state Ecuadorian participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Deaths from AIDS are now cause of late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the positive test: AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> “It was as if I was a bomb,” referring to outline the timing of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make “more suavecito”, without obvious success. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy hid it to his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Decided to take charge of their disease and only began to inform on it; with such determination that already marking his birthday 43. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV Hospital civil Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for the last 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Until then, the director of a clinic in IMSS avoided phase because he “brought a cut.” </seg>
<seg id="2789"> Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignorant of his illness, yet many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, “exhausted” his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> In 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least the first cases reported, “the great achievement means at this point that the sobrevida a patient begins treatment in a timely manner and sobrevida of the general population, is exactly the same,” said the head of the unit&apos;s HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was founded in April of this year in a prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectólogo and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a judgment fatal, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affecting the immune system with patients at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectation for people who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a tally of 200 CD4 and 50 years ago, when 500 CD4 reported. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In simple terms, this means that whoever gets the diagnosis of HIV-positive to 25 years of age, under these terms “while maintaining control can live without problems until the age of 75,” explained the interviewer. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> For dimensionar this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the death rate has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 annual report (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the database have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Why remain deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> A-I think that is not the problem of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So visualizo, has happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have not had shortages of medicine, the problem is that patients are very advanced because unaware of their state of infection, or is in late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Gave a forceful: “nine out of every ten patients when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is make diagnoses more early and, therefore, have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, all the people who require it.” </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council of preventing AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who came to take the test to a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had made a friend and, despite his young age, he was already on stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that is going to die, and they do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> “If I&apos;m going to die, I better reviento three times a week,” say not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to improve food I, well, I exercise, I take the medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, only their parents know that suffered from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life as anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> “I have many activities, work, travel, I have an active sex life, but the truth is, I am cautious to me and to the other person,” listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their privacy with MILENIO Jalisco to motivate those with his testimony today, as part of the World AIDS Day, they fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> To do the test, whether they had risk among more soon know whether they are HIV positive, and it is better if we already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> That, his message, sums up the slogan of the AIDS battle this 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms after the desk </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Large gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, argued Ricardo Salazar tapatío journalist, who has assumed the cause on HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> On sites devoted to this task “has effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before giving us one or two, now give us packages at 100, and that is all very well but there is today who still do not have access to a condom,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> “Why do you want?” the question is common, with derision and value judgments, guiding school social workers, employees of pharmacies and personal health, which they do not want to expose the teenagers, assured the communicator. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Proposed redirecting this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in despachadores public bathing sites in young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not motivate promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Nor is it pay the chelas and motel, responded as Governor Emilio Gonzalez, to ask if you have distribution of condoms in his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> “This is not the sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those already engaged in a sexual activity,” said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Keys in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are cases 13,435 accumulated (12,158 1,317 of AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is 4 ° national place in new cases and accumulated 13 ° of AIDS and HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infection is sexually, 6% to the way blood and 2% to track perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV as a case registered about 4 to 5 people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Ratified by a Court of Appeals ruling that the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the group Vitro via a successful commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a bad precedent for any company with national ramifications in the neighbouring country that takes solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures in support of survival of the firms that laws allow mexican are not valid in the country stars and stripes flag, out of step with international conventions. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practical terms, the boost to the judgment on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale of the court for the district of Bancarrotas North Texas, leaves defenceless mexican firms face the possibility of embargo of its properties across the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution opens the door to the main manufacturer of glass in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> Entry, while the judge notes that cause creditors must abide by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th circuit, headquartered in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial contest featured in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would ignore the procedural international cooperation in cases of insolvency firms with transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, towards that end was created the model of the United Nations for uniformity of international commercial law, as referee the American Law Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the ruling states that without the vote inter-company, recognised in the critical mass of tender commercial debts that they had with their parent&apos;s subsidiaries Vitro, had not been achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the possibility the recognized mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which accepts the scheme. </seg>

<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico has a collection of mental history of local basketball as large as has Héctor “Hetin Reyes.” </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And that is before a stroke confining him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as a player categories of minors, player of the Higher National Basketball, gripping and leader in the BSN with cowboy Bayamón or President of Basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> “I started many hats in the basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was President of the BSN, CEO and President of the National team federating during the 1990s,” Reyes said during a visit to first time home in Bayamón, where lies with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> “Basketball was my life.” </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes not exaggerating to make that assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all dwellings with photos and memorabilias that denote his extensive record. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> In all, which holds more emotion are reminiscent his step for the cowboys since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when served 15 years serving as coapoderado or gripping the franchise. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> “Those were my best years, which I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships jeans since 1967, were already as gripping, coapoderado or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of satisfaction, including five championships deprived from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I despedí with one in 1981, the year of debut Jerome Mincy on the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Thereafter he took over “Cuco” Ortiz, who was a great manager,” said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: “you have a good strong player, 6” 7” stature. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Do you want?” </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who has had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow then recommended the sniper, who was Raymond Gausse nativizado and was one of our best marksmen. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> Remember that said that if Mincy had been given a championship in Bayamon, Gausse help bring another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The championship jeans with Gausse it enjoyed, but already the distance since 1988 was of federating supremo. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Preferred this time to enjoy their records and Mincy on the National team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when I won for the first time in the United States during the Preolímpico Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the 1990 World, where fourth place and should have been bronze were it not for the canadian referee made us repeat the final for the second time, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Does this group from the 1990 World is the best National team that has seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Is among the best, like the one that won the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the Panamericanos in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and give him a pela team of the United States, which was quite similar to that we won the bronze in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> That team not only repeating to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz), but we also had (Javier) “Toñito” Columbus and James Carter, the young brothers Francisco and León (Edgar) and Mario “Quixote” Morales, who had not been able to be at 90 due to a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team which perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Preolímpico of Neuquén, Argentina in 1995. </seg>

<seg id="2897"> Without a doubt, this has been Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Their numbers at international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín. </seg>

<seg id="2901"> Who has been the best leader boricua? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a very good boat which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The young, I very much like the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> Look at what your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Having been part of the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and who in the early 1990s BSN took until 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What you came to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that had wanted to implement, as the regionalisation of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, boys of Ponce only playing in your area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the children travelling and playing too unnecessarily. </seg>

<seg id="2940"> Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt to insatiable with a smile: a charismatic entrepreneur and a cheating husband infidel who tried to its alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), outside detention. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> “I know what I want on the headstone of J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> It should say: “here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.” </seg>
<seg id="2943"> This is the only negotiated that lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Chief, as in the original series, recalled Hagman Friday as someone “enormous, inside and outside of the screen.” </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who had the good fortune to know and love it. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were conveyed a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> He had already finished the recording five chapters for the second season, and a sixth was in process, the station reported. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Immediately there was not a pronouncement of Warner or TNT on how to manage the series loss of Hagman. </seg>

<seg id="2960"> Start during which explores the “end of the world” </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, the students exploring issues apocalyptic as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when Professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew he had an irresistible hook: the end of the long “Final Countdown” of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, have galvanized many people as proof that it is the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Charmé had no idea of what was expected in the next couple of months: cataclísmico hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “deudarmagedón” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of times believe that will begin the Apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> “I realised that this was going to be the more apocalyptic half that has been,” said Charmé this week to the students of the Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is imparting the course “media, culture and the end of the world.” </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, the students exploring issues apocalyptic as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> “Analizamos why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way in which offered some hypothetical scenarios that guide human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, may ignite a war. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and how exploraron compared with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> “I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professor of the history of Latin America and his colleague Matthew Restall Amara Solari attached, a professor of art history and anthropology, have made team to teach a course, entitled simply “the end of the world.” </seg>
<seg id="2975"> “Not add “2012” for always count with the option of providing the course again, in the event that the world will not end,” said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the “imminent ruin”, students should study, generate projects and take final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no students another option to work “until the same night that the world ends,” said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> “Saturó in two hours,” said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> To receive e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, people wondered whether there was still place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> “I find it fascinating that people do to be consoled themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in religion and Sociology at 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> It is that mentality apocalyptic, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student of psychology and Enfermería, 25, claimed to have seen all the apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> “I have never heard about a class that would teach that,” said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> What I enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But no student interviewed-much less a teacher-said to believe in the expiry date of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> “Our first project discussed the mayan prophecy and in some ways it denigrates,” said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years and West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But there is an anxiety that acotó apocalyptic in western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> “Elsewhere, people do not think about this,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> In mostly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of the Salle taught courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about some progress on the “end of the world” there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> “The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We need a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that over the years has been talked about many days of reckoning, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, “people start to think immediately in the next date” or to philosophise on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of seven years after the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers are taking lightly the date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said they intend to go to parties of the “end of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> “Perhaps call some friends to us riamos together,” said Samira Ford, student communications for 20 years. </seg>
