<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the Obama re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan center the latter as a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, the United States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the various member states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments announced new laws since 2009, the procedures for the registration or ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 seen new Republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 Bills introduced in 2011 alone, which limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters present a photograph ID and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote, declared the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens are denied the right to vote, for which a court acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> before the 2006 elections has no US-state of the electorate, a photograph card show. </seg>
<seg id="14"> INDIANA was the first federal state, has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed this practice extended to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years, they promoted bills in 34 states, where voters are forced into a photograph card show. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the citizens of the United States, say that 21 million voters who do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, are often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary card to pay. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions are disproportionately affects young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary light picture card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, are seen as voters, their vote more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photograph card issued by its establishment. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, allow the same States members of Angel- or hunting clubs, choose the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, a federal state in which to choose a proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state to make such a request. </seg>
<seg id="29"> since 2011, a dozen states have laws adopted by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters to the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators in eight states laws in 2011, which was abolished the registration of voters on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration for the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general elections in 2008 were 33% of the electorate in Florida, have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applies to the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the white, 76% of the voters, only 46% of the electorate, in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several Bills have been blocked by the veto, the democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit some of the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the displayed a photograph card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The Democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the outcome in key states for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Brennan centre of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 men represent the 270 votes in the electoral body are needed in order to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to more hesitation is already helping men for the implementation of screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have sought the opinion of two doctors. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The studies conducted in the United States, many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in an observation after 12 years of metastases is between 30% and 40% higher if no screening was carried out. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years if a direct relatives, was already ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is also a higher risk in men Afro-American origin. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer diagnosed. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that are aggressive and indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, the possible options which prostate crabs can remain untouched if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases tend to opt for an active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, where cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes you a active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Nevertheless, I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not it should be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for Urologie, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests. </seg>

<seg id="73"> prevention of the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy way of life is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least 50%,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian cancer society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is expected that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> for the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> encouraging data: Ten years after the elimination of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also the outbreak of disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> It seems the risk for breast cancer, Grimmdarm- Mastdarm- to increase SpeiseröHren- BauchspeicheldrüSen- and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer, fairy tale&quot; throughout the lives, he added. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> in large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectum. </seg>
<seg id="93"> sausages should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between cancer and vitamin supplements. </seg>
<seg id="98"> its investigations but are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> The Canadian cancer society studies on vitamin E are contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While the study found by the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, showed another rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer was not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to speak to burden. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs-Boson analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> In fact, we believe that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> and it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model, our best or &apos;least wrong&apos; explanation of nature and behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> for physicists, however, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson much resembles. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major physics Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> But we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is only a low risk to deceive, and we look at what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world, there is a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to violate this rule-and try not to, because they will hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for such a law, they also applies: the Pauli exclusion principle established, the states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; and the &quot;State&quot; by and large, consists of some of its properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, the physicists share the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are good citizens, are referred to as the Fermi one and just obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> and in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, in any case, not this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These Bosonen links, according to the website the particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen, we will not deal with, and &quot;force particles&quot;, by which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow would be used. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Here, it must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen exotic creatures, such as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read this story, then it is only thanks to a Bosons by exceptional banality: the Photon, or &quot;light particles, the&quot; messenger &quot;of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If a particle with an electrical load will be speeded up or change the direction, &quot;disrupted&quot; the electromagnetic field in this place, as a pebble in a pond was thrown out. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disturbance&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the Bosonen &quot;sources of power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> more stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that a different field, &quot;disrupted&quot; the Higgs field, must be, so that this Boson. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to achieve a very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rock Zerfurcht. </seg>
<seg id="126"> A huge particle accelerator as CERN is therefore needed-the large hadron collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km, in order to achieve such energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> and equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (as is the photon) do not have mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> for what all this research can now &quot;be good,&quot; Mrs Plamondon asks? </seg>
<seg id="132"> for the Science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists all deviations between the observations and to look closely at the predictions of the SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are, in fact, many physicists eagerly hope that such derogations to be found, as the slightest difference open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and could fill some of the holes in the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> We must say that the latter is still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (UPS) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, the CERN such derogations which, until now, has not been found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> In fact, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first permanent line were the first laser (Gepulst)-said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a &quot;gimmick&quot; laboratory. </seg>
<seg id="141"> imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, applications can also surrounded from all the instruments, the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Willard Boyle again during his work in the optics in 1969, for example, has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as &quot;an eye and has brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the Lhc will change our lives, but it means that you really never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> palliative care, and the best way to die... | le devoir </seg>
<seg id="147"> with your committee to &quot;die with dignity&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the life end. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate needs to be resumed in the near future, although a Bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this important area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> le devoir has tried to look into this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr l. still lived alone in his apartment in the MontéRéGie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, Aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years. </seg>

<seg id="154"> &quot;However, it is always a shock to one cannot be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from, only to go to the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> table a delicious lunch, do help he resigned, to eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He even manages to smile bravely and to speak with strangers, which employs around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> the courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating,&quot; he shares. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in Pinkelt &apos;, told Pierre Victor-Gadbois Brodeur, a psychologist in homes. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In return the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the person&apos;s ability&quot; to take a step backwards, he notes. </seg>
<seg id="164"> According to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of this backward steps take place. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-trained Gadbois, all suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the doctors and nurses to look after them, no longer with so-called &quot;curative care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> For example, 89 years, the worst fear, &quot;aware and dying of suffocation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But I really got to know my children from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no more hope in life,&quot; she says, before they accepted that a mask on, helps her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> They are expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, comes from Italy. </seg>

<seg id="188"> &quot;for six months, three to five beds are always subject to cancer patients in less than 45 years of age&quot;, Dr Christiane shares Martel worries. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the home Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their residential site, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care to alleviate the suffering of patients if they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> and several organisations, such as the victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This is the great flaw in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors rule for the adoption of a law on euthanasia and Assistiertem suicide with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> For the month of October is a manifesto in the circulation of prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe signed in order to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not strong enough to ensure that all have the right to a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, move on to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without that it has taken measures to alleviate. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that the only reason why the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival of HéLèNe Richard were already minimal when it broke off a difficult chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> As I Onko login has been told that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I told the fight, please. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was in the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No Omni strong care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients, who have asked to die, to thank the staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain was eased by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be made clear that the palliative care of the pain treatment is not omnipotent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care society the domestic palliative care to the greater MONTREAL 8% of patients not on the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="206"> at the very end of life so the doctors often resort to the Terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or permanently by the time of his death EinzuschläFern. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity on this Terminale Sedierung. </seg>

<seg id="251"> In this season, with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> it from a personal point of view, but also can be explained by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I am on your side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has given me too much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements spur me to improve my play every day. </seg>
<seg id="258"> and in a game, this is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I must stop not enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Claire Fontaine to my game time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They are thus the competition advantage introduced by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The newcomers are accustomed to this summer&apos;s Games very high levels. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that any training unit is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player as I stand up to, and wants to give his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> It gives me Carlo Ancelotti position much in terms of my game. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti instills all technicians respect. </seg>
<seg id="271"> At present, there is no comparable in the Ligue 1 person and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I had just recovered from an injury series. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of Spitzenreiters. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we lurk in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the eighth final in this way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the Association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we have very good European teams say. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First of all, we want the first of our group Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth finales than home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has said the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to be a great European club must win Paris title and make a name in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG the resources so that the project taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a great failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it is really close to my heart, this title cream off. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have finished the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have concluded with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> should normally be master with 79 points... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in title fight, I believe that we have the stuff to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In the light of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you can still find something, what you accuse us, something is certainly frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never win every weekend with 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not of the FC Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to set up a game concept. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Building a team with the time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> in the Champions League we have shown strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> If you look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons fails to qualify for the eighth final, and also has a huge expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="314"> In terms of the sums invested believed one lead you to time out with 15 points. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and ignored the French Cup. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG &quot;Geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems completely have to be dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> so much the better, that speaks of a &quot;Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> In other words, that have strong and firing many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> that is why he came, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> wherever he has played, he has eyes that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> within the team, we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> it also respects the people who surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is really extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to improve their play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows all other also to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> as a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It was very important to me to participate in this championships. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury has prevented from having some game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw things there, from which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I am unable to achieve good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This was the &quot;Bleus&quot; my hope for my baptism. </seg>
<seg id="336"> What has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> what you think of the first few months of Didier Deschamps, head of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national coach is strict, is close to the players and to the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I have no comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved its aim, had qualified for the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the &quot;Bleus&quot; after Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> On 16 October in Spain is forced undecided (1: 1) a start game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>

<seg id="351"> Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies is a political vision by bank monopolies was palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, leading to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented a virtual currency Bitcoin both (convertible into dollars, euros, etc) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange of such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers in the network have been around 200,000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as donation or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> In June 2011, after the course of Bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) to $2, he fell five months later today, before it recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website Bitcoincharts.Com). </seg>

<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that are used to make progress in a video game, you play by winning or buy (and sometimes can also exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, trade is controlled by a Central Authority each time and processed. </seg>
<seg id="362"> At the same time, with Bitcoin all network nodes, auditors, trustee of the paper money-issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> In reality, any transaction between two users will take place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> with the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A series of associated with this transaction data electronically through a double encryption system will be signed. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins account book in the whole network of public accounts are available. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The crucial step is to register this new transaction in the book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done through a mathematical task on the computers will be launched, with the winners of a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a fragment of the file, the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computer &quot;,&quot; the new transaction and do a number, before the whole &quot;Zerhackt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find that number, a special fingerprint (many Noughts at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this figure has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is permanently linked with the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user to cheat two time very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would want to pay, only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains, without a link, because both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer, the task has 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In order to prevent a halved inflation this reward will regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>

<seg id="384"> The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>

<seg id="723"> Every fourth American young people sitting behind the pay of Mc Donald &apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days there was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Wal Mart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell and Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Still, no one can predict whether the protests will further increase or the air soon. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit-making organisations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> in addition to the increase of modest salaries of simple Walmart- and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers Anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> To this day, some Wal-Mart, with workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and Bestreikten branches of the chain, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, whose target people of low and middle-income. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Wal Mart, ranging from nappies on hunting guns and car batteries, all products sold to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in the Wal Mart branches is between 8% and 27% more on average than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Why buy many of the low-paid Wal Mart employees only on their own work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> the prices and the variety made Wal Mart to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Wal Mart can sell the goods are often so favourable, because the workers are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter complaints about hard work conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants in the protests on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the operation of their own health insurance has risen from $30 to $100 a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Wal-Mart, with workers, $9.5 deserves the time, could not afford the increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley, show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Wal Mart 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> The approximately 1.1% more than they now pay donations. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Wal Mart would pass the increases on customers, every purchase you only 46 cents more in the future. </seg>
<seg id="743"> per year would be for you today compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> supporters of Wal Mart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and the companies gave no losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop Thursday evening from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period Wal Mart sold approximately 5,000 articles per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, Wal Mart-funds on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post, that &quot;less than five&quot; Wal Mart-staff laid down the work and the protest only &quot;another PR Stunt,&quot; the trade union, the protests have been organised. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Wal Mart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and others were cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says the company sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> New York City Council member Jumaane Williams </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour under federal and New York legislation. </seg>
<seg id="753"> in fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage and increased, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8,90 US dollar an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody in this expensive city less than they deserve. </seg>
<seg id="755"> as it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> hardly anyone saw is the main source of income or had to stay there longer. </seg>
<seg id="758"> now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald&apos;s always people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants in the protests, which at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald&apos;s on Thursday began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US law prohibits it to stand in the way of corporate governance, this objective and trade unionists Abzumahnen or redundant. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the business leaders are not simply. </seg>
<seg id="764"> the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult but also for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> On this day, vocal protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The height of the protests was a house on at the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, with some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s says it sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and will not pay for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that &quot;we should work together to support the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, the all New Yorkers deserve.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, of which by far not all in the fast-food industry, working in the tens of thousands in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately on lists&apos; </seg>
<seg id="774"> supporters of modern technology purveyors of the recently enlarged reality will usually seen through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> first Google at its annual conference in the summer presented a working model in November was then aware that Microsoft had filed for a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in Microsoft&apos;s laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It fascinates the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands and to create virtual free land. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - you briefly describe what research group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the largely stuck in the phase in which mankind with Pixeln worked on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look ahead of 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors sold a progress, and these days, no more Xbox Kinect, as all for widespread interest. </seg>
<seg id="783"> what awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, plays a great deal still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the spending has not yet decisive. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change, work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We need the computer world in our physical world and make it comprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It is, however, essential that not only the users, but also its surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First and foremost we should Bescheuerten virtual-reality helmets Los! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - what do you think about management? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it is not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - it is certainly not the end solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because not all would like to inform others about his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their specific niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we were in the field of the management of objects on a project in which we in public places with short and narrow, with Ausladenden gestures-face. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not the object of a bracelet, which recorded the movements of the camera, but registered bone and muscle. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Still, it is relatively large, but could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, on the whole, however, the future joint management types, for example Gestik and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How? </seg>
<seg id="800"> We would ask me, for example, this Sprudel Tin you rich? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it and, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> normally i say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - this means they want the users adapt to the what can make a machine at the time and what is not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> In the next time, I think that we must be especially to work on the development of new types of sensor, which enable more reactions from people. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good break in the deep, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> The demands on the basis of their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of dissolution, deep or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> of course, 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 FPS is not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the mega pixel itself, but the quality and the depth of the Matrix. </seg>
<seg id="813"> All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms have more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It must not only along the dissolution of the X-, Y-, but also along the Z-axis will be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of images per second are also important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 FPS, especially for gestures to little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes contact in our laboratory in Redmond developed a sensor with a Regulierbaren processing delay between 1 to 100 milli-seconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I needed for my work as a device, only without contact management and with more images per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - the number of cameras should not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> Kinect is currently working with three &quot;cameras&quot;, with one of them, in fact, an infrared channels and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> and the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not intended to calculate the object deep. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras may solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> or increase the problem, since more calculations would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with various camera orientation, to see how the in three-dimensional identifying a position helps us. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Microsoft presented-if I remember rightly, in contrast to Google&apos;s glasses were not to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - of course it is not pleasant, travelling to keep a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: Tollste variant would be a &quot;rotating&quot; enhanced reality, we have a cloud of the glasses on the smart next May. </seg>
<seg id="830"> the lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but also its weakness, because a larger reality by means of glasses, that they can work together with other virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual Hologramme in the air not only Tony stark is accessible from iron, but also human beings. </seg>
<seg id="832"> This idea, there is a problem, the critics often say: there is no tangible response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers to their group at this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - in my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I believe the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of Taktilen perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is the use of a second hand rather unusual projection document. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure very true! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really aimed at &quot;images in the air&quot; something concrete, for example, the collision of some targeted ultrasound radiation in a certain point where the finger, but a feeling at the moment is still so fragile, as Pustete somebody on the hand ball. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect in the fingers, which is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Have you tried to outsmart the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> We think that it is, what it should feel if it sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - it is a good idea, so we have not tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another task, we will still have to fight for a long time, namely a person is physically in a closed space, to believe he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space here; we are working on concepts with course bands (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large bullets. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain only moderately on lists, and we still have many busy years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> that makes the work so attractive for researchers in the field of virtual reality: on many issues, we are only at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> its own taste rather than culture-Rosbalt.Ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt continued the &quot;Petersburg vanguard&quot; project, which is devoted to city dwellers, the vanguard of the art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the elite list ended up already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without to be known in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artists Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> the whole town knows Kirill Miller, the Red-clad bearded, one time in the Russian Museum, the summer Garden, meeting with scene-or Vernis say found. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images by Kirill Miller will also be issued to attract big crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s or early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and its citizens a firework through its presence on the road you smile in the face and makes for good humour. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently Schnappte turn an organ recital and Petersburg turn organ recital players, as he was for this difficult role in relation to be artists feel life, his philosophy and his image is finally ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the colour red than fashion designer, the deals with the optics and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> in this world is red the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> The society calls for everything from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But I do want my provocations come into contact with the people. </seg>
<seg id="862"> any of my last provocation was an invitation to talks. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - when Wusstest you, that you must be painters? </seg>
<seg id="864"> in an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij, were issued in my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I need to go down this road. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognized painter to the end, and new and free painters such as I were incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I so friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; it was &quot;Pushkin kaja 10&quot; and then was only once. </seg>
<seg id="868"> i prefer it to the theatre, to fashion, music, everything except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> in your way-- and all the United Hospital...-it was important to me, in the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I occupied a space in the Pushkin kaja 10, and there was a musical-artistic Club by the renovation work for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz and I also remember how string with his &quot;ucho van Goga&quot; project there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> string and his friends wore simple songs to play back, close ones and sang to them was also the edgy composer Igor Wdowin today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play live, was its &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the time of &quot;halli Galli. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but the foundations got it in US. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery also &quot;d 137&quot; or the club, &quot;Griboedov&quot; have their origin in the clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There, our staff and guests. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture is still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, there was a survey in the press, in order to award &quot;personalities of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category &quot;artists of the Year &apos;, and so I was at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in new times following the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: it can be known without a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your work have a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and thoroughness of the idea. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be an exhibition, with the theme &quot;the Russian museum as clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> In the past I was socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case. </seg>
<seg id="888"> blur in a clown all and loses its tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world by we require that everyone has fully to dress up. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now, everyone on the clothing and focuses not on the external and internal. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should give people not spit, but he should face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception disappears through the dress up. </seg>
<seg id="894"> We recently saw you in the role of the urban thing organ recital player.-a city should have a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> who, if not i? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - today must be careful of commercial art, considerate and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the past, people were large groups: the Bohemiens loved and the ordinary people the other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not one hundred-dollar note, which everyone likes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you&apos;ve got you will consider who you like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Every cult star now has around 100 followers. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The appearances by STAS Michailow but several thousand. </seg>
<seg id="905"> - abandoned him to be women, where the sexually-social sphere plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="906"> 300 people for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy it. </seg>
<seg id="908"> in my youth, I painted such images in a collectors even in a number with the works of Falk and Larionow. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I began with images, which normally come only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> consumption has no culture, this is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money, in order to be able to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture, which I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Kirill, what is lacking-Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - good culture experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> We say: servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The real czar, it was different, because the Tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are needed. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they blocked the road, because we need more high-level experts, which will evaluate the former right and pave the way for them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> now only one&apos;s own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must therefore seek other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is St. Petersburg for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Moscow-Petersburg is not the capital of culture; there is much more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones, art can only grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural ground because, for example, we have now more writers than readers, and this is not right. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many people who are curious, visit the exhibitions or concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are much less. </seg>

<seg id="935"> guiding caravans of spacecraft with earth people on board are on the search for a replacement planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save humanity, is the important issue of how we in the zero gravity or the spare planet breed? </seg>
<seg id="937"> Many of the choice, in my opinion, there is not. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two real planet, we could at least hypothetically inhabit. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Mars and Venus&quot;, says the scientific staff of the astronomical Institute Sternberg-Vladimir sur Din. </seg>
<seg id="940"> However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus. </seg>
<seg id="941"> life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all possible. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The issue of reproduction in all, the researchers first of all, in relation to the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> A half-century before being carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of the in-orbit peas difference is not in the slightest by the Irdischen species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The breeding of insects, followed by tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, Wachtel eggs were sent into space to study the effects of zero gravity on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicks must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move,&quot; explained the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> without firm underground Korean wild chicks. </seg>
<seg id="951"> ten hours later, Stumpften the instincts of the newborn. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to the light and loud. </seg>
<seg id="953"> You then simply died four days later. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;twice we slip chicks and were all then, simply because it is impossible to work there with them,&quot; says Vladimir Sychew failed experiment with the chicks in all. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding cages of animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the bio-satellite &quot;Bion&quot; only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> It was an experiment, which already fertilized with rats have been sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, it was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;that was with the satellite, but once again, it was only a single experiment, biotechnology and research must continue,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing the space rats offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction directly in space could not solve so far. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> animals from their natural habitat can be simply do not follow their reproduction driving. </seg>
<seg id="965"> In contrast to animals that humans could in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is able to think Abstraktem and can generate a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> from ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women fly for 50 years in all. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk was Tereschkowa. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most valuable that mankind is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our MöWe flew and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is the space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> After this flight, it will bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Finally, no one answered this question,&quot; says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, gave the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, Andri Jan Nikolajew, was also kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, only the second woman in all, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice was in orbit and even work outside the space vehicle leisure, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only very few cosmonaut, after long flights, in which everything went well and healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit,&quot; concludes kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But the mankind for new ways in the field of biotechnology, the radiation protection and generate artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hydro-engineering laboratory in preparation for the centre of the cosmonaut preparation is a compulsory station during the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> The cosmonaut routine wins here in a state of flux for the work in open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the zero gravity. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If adults water as pleasant, it is also a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is, as would the small Ichtyander testimony to that life on the ocean emerged out of the country. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother in amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier access to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle this is logical, since from the birth until the first swim just 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget,&quot; says baby Swimming Teacher Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a situation of zero gravity is the Bauch- and basin muscles very quickly and that is also the capacity to extract the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we avoid the introductory tool by birth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber, extract for the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand the child also artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> without requiring that they can train the organism the skeleton and muscles do not. </seg>
<seg id="996"> a newborn baby in-orbit not as an adult to training in a suit. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He is simply the absence, which is vital for his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment, we jointly, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely Unangepassten will bring people to the world,&quot; says the head of the Ethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-biological problems slice, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> But at some point it will become reality if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in all. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Nkú Chief: control of the black-system failed due to the fault of the policy </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but back in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the conversation for AktuáLně.Cz says the Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší Kontrolní úřAd Nkú), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that this is not the case with us,&quot; Kala comment on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar result also appears to have a common control by Czech and German examiners. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He leads a negative practice example the attitude of Prime Minister Petr NečAs for the so-called &quot;black-system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not trouble with controls-so the system is now banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but is not simply the government chairman, and the control, whose duty is to hamper the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work&quot;, Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> They spoke at the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> So what was it exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> there is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is a question that the European legislation, as public contracts to manage and build the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> all of this, we have compared with each other, and, although the investigation is not finished yet, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, perhaps even &quot;with US laws are strict and perfect &apos;, but the actual application is better in Germany in some of the parameters. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough, always new and more precise rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project? What is for them from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> just such a common control could help that we stop constantly perfecting the laws in order to try and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this evidently not particularly positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> efficiency means one thing to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of the threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we are achieving this objective. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps it is that the system in this way only with excessive &apos;paperwork&apos;, and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, remained higher than if the threshold values. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system work in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our Nkú, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent to Nkú the federal court that is built, and also has a college that is slightly different in principle both authorities to be formed, but similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, in other words that there is this federal courts in the individual countries, the German system is different from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Brh can only control federal funds, consistent with our national resources. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> public funds, which will be managed by the counties and municipalities, under the control of the country&apos;s courts. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What the German legislation is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general I would compare without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a model in some ways, but it is certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is perhaps because the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may I do not particularly like. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> This is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise you would have nothing of the cooperation with our authority, not true? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority to review the procurement law, feel they have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> In view of the fact that this amendment is, in force for only a short time, it is not in our tests so far. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since our controls take place, we must here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We feel effects have so far been rather controls in the preparatory phase of the future-we have introduced the new instrument of control &quot;identification of risks of waste,&quot; and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-This will effect the changes, of course, since the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified and others </seg>
<seg id="1037"> you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this adoption. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem, however, is that the rules can be &quot;strict&quot; and can no longer be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are a test Unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of the operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) accountable, that any failure of the procurement law is tantamount to a breach of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> But it is useful to make the law more stringent? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who attack and want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have committed a mistake, not the actual decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say, first of all, what is not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The prime minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not bother with control of the so-called &quot;black-system &apos;- What exactly does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The black-system is now banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A Bill must have valid, and if something is banned by law, but it is not just the Government can control, whose duty is the chairman, and the monitoring of compliance with the law, in its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;we need to change the law and allow the cause&quot;, but he can&apos;T say that we act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer simply because of procedural irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that is what we are lacking. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets, there is occasionally ice GläTte, but mostly they are dry. </seg>

<seg id="1158"> note, however, that an improvement in the situation is also always depends on the efforts of the parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> in London and Madrid, it is common for people with severe disabilities itself constantly in the public area can move into a museum, toilets etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not just that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events with the band the tap tap slightly ahead of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if significant from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, are things really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, only individual cases of particularly strong personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The tap tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years: What has motivated in 1998, to set up a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I then began as carers in JedličKa Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Among other things, and because I am a musician and Saxofon Games, along with a colleague, I have established a music company. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> and with time, as our host, LáďA Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us; we have also started to promote active for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> we realised that if you are doing something and not to see this outwardly, their own performance, in a sense, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good teachers, high-quality equipment and etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was their goal to bring it with the tap tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> from the beginning, I felt the potential that we can tackle the things differently. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Often the other copies in show business today. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> in its own way, it is only logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after some time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few really unique things and, I would venture to say that it includes tap tap. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of the spectators usually has, naturally, is, of course, with suffering; this is just... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and deserted nature, which we regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people living a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities something, this is a step forward not only for themselves, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was for this success, it is also helpful that a strict head, how many people are you listening? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to make something good, in many things, we must not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think this is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have twice the week test preparation must go and spend a lot of time to travel on concert stages, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the tap tap has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were, from the outset, since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> only one: LáďA Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. The people come and go, we cannot prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> who has the will and the desire to participate, we always welcome. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994 with a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the way the space in Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> before the Second World War workers Polish Cosmos fans with the space, and they are not always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I refer for example to the presentation of A. šTernfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, the idea of the author from his pioneering work &apos;entrance to Kosmonautik&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (1905), the audience to users, but cold and after years reminded šTernfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In the year 1934 šTernfeld won for &quot;entrance to Kosmonautik&quot; by Robert Esnault-Prix reps-donated Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of the astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He wrote hundreds of articles and several books published in Polish newspapers to these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis recognised worldwide contribution to the development of space, inter alia, that the Krater Erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> already in the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, was planned for the missile propulsion. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of the text and the details of this project, remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> it is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or stop the Draisine. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information come solely from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry started to deal with rocket-powered bullets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke KomóRka tech Niki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with the Institute and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It is clear from the traditional documents that the research into the stage of practical tests was reached. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But the research was then suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft a photo from ing. RohozińSki electric rocket, and in the following year, the hunting &quot;raki ETA Torpeda Powietrzna I Rakietobomba Lotnicza &apos;the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> On the eve of the war, all the projects on the military use of missile technology from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-coordinated Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, by the beginning of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Another appeared to space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (polskie Towarzystwo Astro Nautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this society in the November edition of the magazine problemy in 1954 in the four major articles of the space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal of establishing a space company. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there were already the first projects for satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space future would have. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to accede to the 1951-based International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was already 1956 due in the autumn. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, was the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this post he had held until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> since 1956, the PTA in the forefront of the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (raki ETA Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built in 1959 and began in the BłęDóW desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work-RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of high winds. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, however, was the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> RM, the successor to the first missiles of the type Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years from 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of fraud 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> This missile were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), from differences in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0,62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum height in all three types of fraud 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965-1968 was in the aviation institute developed the meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was in a position to make a useful weight of 10 kg in an amount of approximately 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> then the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth noting the accession of Poland to the cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, and two years later was followed by the creation of a national COS par-Committee. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland also participated in the context of the cosmos-programme with Soviet satellites in space research, and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski, after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second international kosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> In the last week, the constitutional court the law on voluntary work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision caused a lively debate in the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> To understand this concept is a condition in which the manufacturers trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition &quot;&apos;, in order to seize a larger market share and to increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> on a large scale, this means for most companies to transfer their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the private capital is not social responsibility and also bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, are necessarily the spending increase. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused by them. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies will create a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This manifests itself in particular amendments to existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to force its own people, to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is an economic force in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of workers. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> for several years in Germany, there are public food distribution to the poor, which are no longer in a position to feed, through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> in the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly given to cases in which workers such a low salary, that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> such a scandal was also in the case of workers exposed in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures of practically all EU-Southern States will undoubtedly be in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance, on the fringes of society to languish, and I hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is naturally the question of where this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, moves the poverty of; or the capital remains the same from one country to another, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and Africa at work for a fraction of the salaries of the employees. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This concerns the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> ad nauseam Liberal theories and the media claim that the state must not involved with capital in its own economy and that economy could lead to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state should not intervene directly in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> then, however, we must ask whether the private policy and therefore the whole state influenced or even in their own selfish interests. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The clear answer is: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all member states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the field of legislation, the corruption, the mutual benefit, virtually everything is criminally punishable, but nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department lack of finances private, closely interdependent with the industry law firms charged with the preparation of draft legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The draft law will be then passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> all the violence is no longer, as the western constitutions, but from the people of strong financial groups with their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously the liberal democracies soon in a situation at the moment, as you APP Ian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic when Caesar and Pompeius&apos; describes: &quot;The state was long in the break, and the offices were filled with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> corruption has grown incontinent, and people with already buy votes on election &quot;...&quot; people with character applied for not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul &quot;...&quot; we already really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this serious situation was a dictatorship, and that a strong man... should be chosen &quot;APP Ian thought although Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, based on today&apos;s society as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference to their own advantage, without overall interests of society. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> private capital is by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not in the slightest for deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The reason for the rise of fascism and communism in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economy, we must therefore find systems in the 19th and 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> from today&apos;s situation, can be regarded as certain break the fall of this regime for the liberal democracies, already in the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> particularly disastrous is the fact that today&apos;s elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we have already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of older and newer, in complete ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, or at least not lasting. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the level of social security of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore bound. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution targeted political and social reforms, the capital increase the state participation in the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the Government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;... that nothing from violence occurs, or ever could be,&quot; sings Song fragile, Sting, whose main verse in the refrain is: &quot;... so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When my sons were no wars, there would be no&quot;, says the dying well Ele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> the one behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the call of the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and the state of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty and who the victim; in the end, the residents of Israel today were born into the areas including self-management in the current political situation and we have not seen the beginning of the violence itself. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I am talking about the readers look to open up the behind the scenes look at whom the 95 years tension (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of land in the Middle East in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are deduced from this and from my own understanding of who or what group of people strongly affected the events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> in every era, we can represent a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were autonomous, their steps, or whether their throne someone of their actions to a specific goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time in which the world&apos;s wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power not live within the span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among these astronomical rich families, a particularly stands out, which could be described as the head of the Octopus have (I do not know whether you have someone, but I cannot agree with this)-the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> much will not be written on them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) was bought in the 1990s by the Rothschilds of the 19th century, in order to prevent its name with high criminal, whose background is still consolidating their power, to increase their wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world&apos;s central banks, and the central banks of the countries in which they are involved, they prepare wars or this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, following the fall Ghaddafis only four, and Russia remained in the meantime, his bank has suggested the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to confront this family, had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds of Bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, launch their own (read: State) notes and 1865 was murdered in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to publish their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed-he was murdered in 1963; the Honourable Member Louis MC Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global power designs the Rothschilds of the years 1859-led to the drafting of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars in 1871 by Albert peak, a freemason of 33rd and highest level of recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was aimed to remove the large monarchists States nature of Europe, by the second war should be broken the colonial rule of Britain, in particular, and the third war should reduce the world&apos;s population on about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would ensure their comforts and luxury and would not create so many resources), a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the run-up) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order the chaos from Chao-order). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed, so that crises such as the one you not repeat triggered in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After you managed by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution, the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European power was Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to be able to make easier the second world war, the bankers by the policy a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations documented; it created to impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer the German only a sufficiently strong leaders, offered simple solutions, named the guilty and Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of the group with a strong German minority, should play the role of a fifth column and also, to the war fire. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in a branch of the establishment of a state for the Jews: JudäAs with Jerusalem as its capital, if possible, at the historic area (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> the Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> there were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke the chain of the international bankers had initially thought, or if everything went according to plan, it is hard to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in concentration camps created the basis for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war reparations was against Germany to prepare the ground for the second world war, the declaration of the state of Israel is the creation of the one point for the third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to unlock this war, the Jewish people as the victims in the front line in the fight in the second world war, this time with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only within the country itself, but also international (just think of how strongly people into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where wrong just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of the individual and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> We must distinguish between the citizens of Israel and its leaders here, but the international bankers, in Israel as well as we, the people, exclusively their own candidates for the election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current prime minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a vulnerable, the international bankers fascism loyal politician, of which is doing in order to provoke a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), a global conflict could spread quickly, and with Iran, because of the control on just 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, could come to a destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the light as the words of David Rockefellers from the 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> in its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> a world in which the rest of the human population of the small group of financial aristocrats. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> a world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip implanted in order to submit this nature of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;and it does, that the small and large, and the rich and the poor, which is free and all the servants a time signal in their right hand, or in their face, that no one can buy or sell it because the time signal, the name of the animal or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> here is wisdom, who has common sense, giving the number of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred sixty-six. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: if it&apos;s the worst Hollywood call </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979 demonstrate a mob of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> for their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> There was no positive outcome from this situation for the American government, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made things even worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The director and actor Ben Affleck&apos;s Argo film describes an episode of this history, gave the United States a small part of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> immediately before the occupation of the embassy managed six embassy staff fled. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> This came after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant story on the cover of their true identity-they travelled with Canadian passports allegedly turn in the country disguised as members of a film at the places visited for a science-fiction movie. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan developed by experts for &quot;Exfiltration&quot;, Tony Mendez, also made the necessary cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The cover was credible, article published in journals, conferences have been held on this film project and the fictitious production society had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a particular combination of film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called &apos;caper movie &quot;-- the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This change in the documentary film the mood levels, on the one side (in the title sequence Ikonische contemporary photographs showed scenes from Tehran, and in the film version of the same situations, there are no great differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easily taken. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions-men in suits at the meeting table, in the official Gallery, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck, this film is a remarkable revival of his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> A BeläChelten actor has become a respectable Director, as well as actors, it is now no longer the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> argo is his third game film for the thriller not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time it is Afflecks first film not in the local Boston director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood contrasted with the more general. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran &quot;played&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have taken place-the first sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity and feeling yet Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere the history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff in a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to face up to the fact that history really does not offer many exciting scenes in cinema sense. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> with the few working but quite successfully, it helps sometimes, the reality-was not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the impending crisis is averted by a telephone call at the airport in Tehran in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, something curious). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is determined by the need to act too much in too many places to show. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood workers are very charming, but their characters could have more space and they are not alone in the film by far. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film that loses traction. It is a film, with some interest and the design and the retro-style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years Goutieren. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> He inspires enthusiasm, however difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> Today, in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and, as proof, such as excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> directives for bubbles of balloons, for bananas and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server Www.Bankovnipoplatky.Com, the annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided that the competition this year, &quot;most absurd regulation or idea-workshop&quot; from the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;This idea has brought us the plan put forward by the EU, a 40% quota of recently introduced in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik Nacher, cares about the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they pose a lower risk for insurance companies objectively. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Another incredible cases from the workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, &quot;said Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> One of the controversial EU regulations including the binding mixture of Bioethanol fuel in its wake, nature is harmful to the ban on the reliable contain mercury thermometers, only because this is a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on cages, but because of the size of chicken eggs this year were much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;proliferation&quot; or even the sales ban traditional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> bananas must be 14 cm long </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels the rule of one or more member countries (for example, currently Czech Republic is trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks also veto-threat). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> also lobbying interests were behind that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and curvature anomaly &quot;must not &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards would impede trade Harmonisiere. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to the balloons in the sale must be labelled with the suggestion that children under eight years the air balloon without the supervision of an adult to bubbles. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU stood on a US study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restrictions already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of the JahrmarktströTen. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There is also the strange thoughts at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials itself-each, an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece must not use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server BankovníPoplatky.Com nominee in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned also the absurdities of the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU, the highest volume of food stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU was located on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic exceeded the volume of canned mushroom, which we set out, for example, then a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money, but that they have no sea or from the idea of funding requests for aid. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas came not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> in the EU, we will apply for reimbursement, &quot;he declared, in the autumn of 2004 the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (čSsd). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the state were overcrowded camps as a result of the intervention purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Another way because the Czech Republic to the ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far forward that they organised a contract on the purchase of grain from countries, which have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> requests for financial aid provided the communities under the auspices of the Ministry of regional development minister Pavel NěMec (US-DEU), it has to be means for the establishment of were requests to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> regulations in the member countries are easy targets for criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and also to effectiveness and development for the whole of the European Union, deserves more recognition according to some experts. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> These experts believe are a serious problem for the EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations have been imposed by individual member states. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> emotions calls here also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight not always wins. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czech Republic has been following a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name &quot;Olomoucké TvarůžKy &apos;defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename&quot; TuzemáK &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The name rum must only be used for products from sugar cane distil at, not for products from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The official list of registered products in the EU are in the society of the world-famous cheese, feta, gorgonzola, the LüBecker Marzipans or the famous Parma now the karlsbad Zwieback PohořElice and TřEboň, carp, or the Saazer hops. </seg>

<seg id="1411"> &quot;I want the people that the Republic save, but I am just an amateur,&quot; said Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Senator, how is the idea, to run for the office of the President? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not about me, Senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything would work without problems in our country, I would get nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, as thieves are walking around freely, while people&apos;s taxes and increasing the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to be politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But if I see something I do not like to propose a solution, then I try to change this. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I am over 40, independent and party, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to run for Senator or the President. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, they have managed and then on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Let it not your voters? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have said all the time that I will take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections in. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> later clarified this and I said that I will run for the office of the President, if I am elected senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My aim is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> For this, I need as much influence as possible and as a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and the television rant, but any order, want to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> the media want to deprive the honour and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> I was claimed, for example, that journalists would bribe, or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about their vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The fight to have the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability and with retrospective assets declarations by politicians over 20 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You will have to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this regard, and the Senate as a whole only legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> as ordinary citizens, I argued that the tour guide is a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded policy-if someone from the right or the left is a good proposal is rejected, this deliberately, and considers the people only. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> as an independent party-I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I think without drawers and dogmas of each party can take what is best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> do they see themselves as man in politics, more to the right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> I am from the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> But for me this right-left think is totally unimportant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we can make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right-wing camp; I would unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I support publicly any good solution approach, even if this always comes from the KsčM or of the ODS, and I will oppose bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It is not you, if someone described them as populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But they did not confirm what you have just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you have a business plan in a company, then you are an ideal target and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> and they want to be closer. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Can I call it populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, functioning in the world already, or they have been discussed by important experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in parliament they just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> and they are in politics not far in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> or do you believe that you, when you talk only long enough with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to get them on our side, to achieve these objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As President, it would be no problem for me, to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> and the raised would then say why they may reject it. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> a strong personality, refers to maladministration can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> You only need to look at the direct election of the president, which was a credit to the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have only just started with the policy and attempts to find the support of the majority, for my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to do things for themselves to judge; and if it does not work, then I am back in the private sector in six years. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> The Czech Republic should save sounds a little, as if Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I am hitting alone; I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether or not you want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have, for example, with Radim JančUra, but rejected because of overwork. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I also support the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which exposed the fraud in the trade with easy fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> my candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of the electorate, have not gone to the elections have mostly gone, and the elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are only two independent in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people who have elected Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district main men. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> do you think about the creation of a separate party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not thought about, because I have no time to review the past any potential party member, and certainly not the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not time money for the presidential campaign; at my transparent account only 20,000 Czk. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> They have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> They speak of assets declarations, as would their? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million Czk. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a housing for about 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is worth around 10 million and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and šKodu superb, worth around one million, and then I have a few million to the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was a child&apos;s dream-James Bond always liked me, as it was in the car, Galant on women and, at the same time, fought against the evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> They drive an Aston Martin have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for her campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> They say that they want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I make about debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> and I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign will be basically covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the senators content I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not to finance the English school, the cost of 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> They are further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> They said that they will drive back these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not with the level of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I cut my activities in part. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy director of travel agencies in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People want to see me as Good Samaritans, saving the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I must also bit of life. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> You were used as entrepreneurs in which monthly income? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Around 200,000 to 400,000 and that is still the case. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> But as President I think businesses would stop. </seg>

<seg id="1503"> and Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby factories, says: &quot;But, well, it is the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> I wonder, however, what we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> all have the Internet, Ipad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is yet in one of these old-style libraries, or on a voluntary basis? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> spijkenisse, a little survey the most sleep city at the gates of Rotterdams is strange record. </seg>

<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> and so, the city fathers, recognized that there is only one way, should the statistics: a library. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> The Rotterdam architecture office Mvrdv Winy Maas, a master of foolhardy beam charts and producer of Witzigen, often cynical buildings, took up the cause with his usual calm and appeared for the competition-hearing in 2003 with five books at the poor and a grin on your face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> and while the jury looked Verdutzt and with the Achseln Zuckte Stapelte the impudent maas his splendid Mitbringsel ended according to the size of a pyramid and its Aktionistisch founded speech with the words: &quot;Love city community!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of spijkenisse, for the so-called Boeke Mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive mountain excavated sites. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is also part of a revitalization project, to the underground car park, supermarket, post office, and a few neighboring residential and row houses with a total of 50 homes. </seg>

<seg id="1518"> The project is also nominated for the Dutch national wood award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> The faceless town is a test-tube, yet had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, whose white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture richer. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all spijkenisse now has on the first public culture construction in the history of his existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The Long Road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: books El Dorado under glass. </seg>

<seg id="1529"> We have read the classic room configuration to the head and the field of Interior externally imposed. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The mountain is shrewdly: Home of the books in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environment technology centre and house key. </seg>

<seg id="1556"> The concept is deployed. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> the shelves are filled to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think now, thanks to our invitation to all inhabitants of a certain relationship with this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> and if it is only to grace. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> In doing so, Mvrdv those accepted managed, in the jargon called identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> spijkenisse wrote literary history. </seg>

<seg id="1565"> It is high time that this is a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;German must play greater role &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany, which abstained in the vote on the opening of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin on a fine diplomatic line. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first indicated that it opposed the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why not? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious, however. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But, at the same time, I believe that it is also not supported the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This has finally been enforced by the NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on important international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is due to the fact that surrounded his foreign policy and away from a policy was pay, so to speak, of the United States, to a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans find themselves between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected that a more independent role, but they are not used. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think you buttons to their role, but they are on the path to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, like France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What is a &apos;normal&apos; foreign policy, specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness, in positions of national interests, which are independent from those of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it must be careful to the public, but also the elites, not to offend in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It plays a role in any case. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would also not want to attach much weight to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In any case, but it plays an important role in German thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has its relations with the United States damaged by it has abstained from voting on important decisions, such as on the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> I do not think, therefore, that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> maybe Germany will play even a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, on the other hand have been clear for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> because the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, the government can not represented this position publicly, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not so great as they seem. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then it is Obama, not so upbeat of Netanyahu&apos;s policy. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany is finding it difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> so you can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> that they do so with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to press Europe to a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> I believe, however, that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany to see itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play a major role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> or is the lead Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country, to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> For example, if we look at the Euro crisis, every time when Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> that makes it the German is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> So Germany is in a more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy continues, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply need to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you do not like it is inconvenient for them and they will be much less popular, c&apos;Est la vie. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the trans-Atlantic Academy Institute, in Washington, in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together to meet the challenges of the trans-Atlantic community research. </seg>

<seg id="1632"> an Armani is also a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is an Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> behind it is a very officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the companies. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, it enjoys protection, as long as the actual name donors did not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> and even then, it is not clear whether they are right. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It will be increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the firm Taylor Wessing, specialising in protection of rights violations in the far east. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> the clones are a few extra letters so that they can register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies will also be legally copied in this way, the sports goods manufacturers Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> stalemate hole opens up a raft of registering the trademarks Bureau in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company that protect trademarks Zegna DF puma, an art, and also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The Chinese world champion injured in copy and intellectual property, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities there is MehrstöCkige department stores sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But the stalemate hole cases are different: on behalf of his client, it is that Chinese companies are the trademarks Agency officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call the &quot;bang Ming Pai, a passenger brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Based on the floor &quot;bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So are women, rich men angling. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for business, it must combat &apos;calls for stalemate hole. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will be watered down, the position alone, the damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The cost of financial losses and the process of the industries affected are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research society CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and is the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But erased dubious entries in the register trademarks are difficult to achieve and go into money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> up to nine years, the process can drag on, with uncertain results. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reported cases in which the court authorities because, after the long duration of the reported name to &quot;market had become reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff misfortune, must pay the Plagiator even money because he injured, says stalemate hole its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> famous cases relate to graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company, which recently took over the German concrete pump Bauer putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> To date, the Chinese must therefore use a symbol that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo-buyer Geely, originally used a blue and white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The Lacoste fashion manufacturers lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> the trademarks agency Ctmo in Beijing is that there are bottlenecks 2010 due to lower personnel and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, one of the &quot;emergency situation in business returned to normal life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So is the Unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was about 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> 57, 000 such cases have been completed, almost 75 per cent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, still 81.500 appeals in the office waiting for execution. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> It costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the Ctmo more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record and China means that for the tenth consecutive year, the list of new applications in all the world, shares the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> that also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million head. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> On average, means that any registration simplified 1280 yuan or costs EUR 160. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> It costs a lot, as the case of the German family company freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> for more than seven years, the company has been struggling against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Although the German could achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation of motor vehicle parts was unearthed. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But secured the freudenberg followers continue the Chinese rights to the brand. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We have failed in this, as in Germany, family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> the trademarks agency Ctmo rejected the objection of the Munich back. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two bodies, freudenberg, opponents of the law, but the process is continuing until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> You must watch your step </seg>
<seg id="1686"> now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs could hardly figures the company archives have even one hundred years old need to look through files in order to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, freudenberg offered the opposition a &quot;high six-digit code amounts&quot; to settlement in vain. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;That shows how much we value,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East to places even after Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> that is, if there imitators vulnerable brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> It was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany the name freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> However, this business has abandoned the company long, he could avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;You must watch your step,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch rates German companies to be very careful in doing business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, much more should the foreigners &quot;somehow everything is worth protecting, also registered in China,&quot; as Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, can be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if freudenberg in the last act of his trademark drama is governed, then it is the other side pay royalties on their own behalf, Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> or, in the segment in question, we will be squeezed out of the market. </seg>

<seg id="1741"> syphilis and tripper come mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert-Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five all in Germany reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden Candidose (mushroom), tripper and humane Pappilomaviren often common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults here is comparatively low, however: around 20% of new HIV infections in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections are among young people much more frequently than other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> European surveys three-quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>

<seg id="2124"> We have him only a mattress and a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even on the ground. </seg>

<seg id="2146"> I had on a recent trip to Mexico City has only just arrived into the hall and was at the passport control, I find. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> signs pointed to two queues: one for &quot;mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), the other for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;aliens&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I was there a few seconds long, uncertain, to which I should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and my life has been called &quot;Mexicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic acronym-just as my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York &quot;Italians.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I opted for &quot;between Mexico-American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> and in the home in my grandfather&apos;s day, there was no need for acronyms or Hyphenation. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough, at least for me in this language at both ends of the interviews. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a mother spoke Lers and my American accent I will also not. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of all those issues which are expected when the heads of the two countries, immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today with the same likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He would ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc model of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> and Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war in Mexico against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans are probably never a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country, perhaps gun, forced to leave more than half its territory to them. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans in centuries and are not in minutes, memories of this event not to overlook. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a US government officials only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country&apos;s complaints about how the Americans press their neighbouring country&apos;s sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> monte cripple Zuma and the children are on the war path. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge of Mexico in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> The inclination to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. People, provide opportunities for the country, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of life a person-a parents&apos; or grandparents&apos; part, perhaps no chance offered in Mexico and in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> and in most cases, this person is a profile-dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to you. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> and though we might now live the American dream have visited, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live-not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> our identity is sometimes blurred, but perhaps what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is clearly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders may not. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> they see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not between Mexico and enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In their view, our very existence is a symbol of the failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families not failed, then they would not have gone in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> and then we would not see trapped behind the silk curtain-with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> my wife was born in Guadalajara and went to the United States legally as a child, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, also have a clearer idea of who they are, because Mexicans and Mexican Americans taking this evil. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While the US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band los tigres del norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> and we will be seen as Mexicans in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> as I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complex: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> You want Mexican Americans as a provisional &apos;ambassador&apos; for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American colleagues of how great a visit to this country and to exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> that will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> many wounded feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> and given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid, because you alone, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> that is only fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready for dealing with Mexico, the United States awarded to one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members have been dealt with until not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &apos;Mexican&apos; as I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> old wars, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected pillars for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war lost or gained. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> at first glance seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week&apos;s struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had even large losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and most densely populated corners of the planet will be loaded, it is Israel which, until now, has not managed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> and Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a revival, regional power, which was once known as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamic crescent-Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, Syria, where rebels an increasingly more Islamist-style StüRzung Bashar Assad&apos;s face, to Jordan, where Hamas allies could threaten the King. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> President Muhammad Mursi and, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the inhabitants of most and most important Arab country-on Israel&apos;s southern flank has changed the balance of the region sustainable. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had only a little time left for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In contrast, the Brotherhood VerschwäGert with Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on people&apos;s views. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could prove the Hamas as an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Militarily speaking, Hamas is no longer dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli anti-missile system, &quot;iron dome&quot; can prove its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israel will not be able to sleep more easily for at least a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States remain firm in its position, many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel, have fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed 30 Israelis, since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the non-proliferation of the plants in the West Bank and that into the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. To protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal, however, continue to be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is good. his Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman has allied with a more combative group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why this nanny behind wily Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you really have the control over the West Bank, would you then do not exactly as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, firing missiles? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and to punish them if they dare to raise the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It may be that the hardliners prevail, but the Arab spring could make you a line by the court. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>

<seg id="2261"> health warnings and sick body parts to neutral green packets, are the same for all tobacco brands. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world&apos;s first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia entered into force, so that will brand logos and colours are replaced by neutral Oliv green lid, moreover, with drastic use images, which show health body parts and cigarette smoke sick babies and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Apart from the different health warnings and pictures from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand name are printed in identical, small letters. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> Australia leads the world&apos;s strictest rules on tobacco packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> the Australian Federal Government to divert young people from smoking by the GlamouröSe picture of tobacco consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The government of studies that have shown that people with 26 have not started to smoke, with 99% of disabled likely will not start after. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;We can already see in young children age that you understand the message, the tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image,&quot; Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoted studies have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and the changes have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries already are considering similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> the tobacco lobby fought hard against the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> So it was with the laws would trade on the black market, which will lead to cheaper cigarettes and easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The legislation will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the laws have driven their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses Etuis, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicone Cap to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the companies, British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco Australia two months ago, the supreme court challenge to the legislation failed. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale business and await new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> This is a good business for us. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in exactly the population to the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of an Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, it prohibits them as sport sponsors and most traders, cigarettes in shops are no longer forced to interpret. Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sides, but has no influence on international sides. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Tobacco is marketed and has left only a small area, to bid for its products is around the Internet does not,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media such as YouTube, twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen a rise in experience to brands, which were written by &quot;ordinary people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question: is this just a private person who enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes, so that even incorporates a video-or has a marketing agency to do? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than marketing focus to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far as to pay, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to challenge the new rules, those countries in the World Trade Organisation to complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> a WTO decision is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries, considering the similar packaging laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country in 2001, the photographic warnings wrote. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> many Australian show smokers defiantly. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignoring them. </seg>

<seg id="2294"> to be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operators of the tobacco trade &apos;King of the pack &quot;in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging have filled his shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I needed an hour to supply Einzusortieren now I need four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have simply completely ban cigarettes-then we said okay, that&apos;s it, we close,&quot; adds he obviously upset. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> in a constantly Elektrisierten world, it is also time to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport as the plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for other airlines. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had enough time for me to make a few thoughts to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not want to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite NervtöTend-even if books, magazines and Iphones available (and tax-free shopping, of course). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and child development experts boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> If it were up to you, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> in interesting, so that the brain is forced to trains to lose what is perhaps the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> and because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen that benefit us the benefits of boredom, not more. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> and no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I will come back. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of &quot;boredom: a lively history&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011) is not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Indeed, boredom has a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The house walls Pompejis fault a Latin inscriptions on boredom, which goes back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and has been discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, &quot;a satisfactory job, but not to be able to define&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Consequently, boredom, differs from apathy to the effect that the person does not want to be employed, but this. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> However, in the case of the apathy that there is no rush to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience boredom, he says, in a &quot;disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad tempered and the feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> boredom can almost hear such as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, we believe that US is dull, even if we just have to focus on. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention&quot; in German, for example: &quot;the UntäTige sense: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; which appeared in the journal perspectives on psychological science &quot;in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues listening to an earlier experiment, the participants a band, a person read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, had nothing to do with the content. others heard it at the lower level, so it is barely perceptible hear these noises, while the third group was not. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who barely audible or listening to television, gave more boring than the other two groups feel they have had problems to focus, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> However, if you have a tedious activity, &quot;as the search for defective products to help distract a factory conveyor belt, music and not to feel bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln often interpreted as signs of boredom can fight, even by people who remain physically more. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;studies have shown that children who keep Herumhampeln, learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still,&quot; Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We will all eventually boring-my delayed flight, a film, a particularly Shun dull DröHnender loudspeaker. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people bore more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> researchers to measure these differences, developed a scale to boredom in the 1980&apos;s vulnerability. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> on the Richter scale, statements such as&apos; many things I have to do and are monotonously repeat &quot;and&quot; I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scale, researchers have found that young is more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are a fairly Abgespannter bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents by seven or eight times a day with a pager Kontaktierte. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23% claims to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of the parents said to feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom has risen or fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> He was sure, however, that &quot;the youth is seen as particularly boring&quot;, mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily lives end. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, back to my original question: is boredom, healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> in the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads people into extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and authors analyse the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom, the brain wants a say, that we should do something else,&quot; Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain do not always know just what you should do the best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If a is dull and the energy used to be and to cook, we will be happy to play Gitarre. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television may evaporate for good feelings to ensure this in the short term but in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So who has spent his child an Ipad is enough, it can distract you from the boredom. It has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> and he adds: &quot;self-regulation is a situation on the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate for long time. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also not critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should also at ease from the permanent AktivitäTs- and technology sprinkling. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds so than we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, he believes that the people just looking for a way to switch off and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we constantly be stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise has fallen silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> in Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime before a court in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few tasks and a marijuana pipe, he smoked as this. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day, with the drive to Kansas in Lamar near the border, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug supplies-excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a penalty of $100, and was given a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But it is also a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, depends on the answer to hundreds of smaller less by law, as the location for drug offences. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of offences to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, approved similar measures, have already dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of a small extent. This is no longer legally permitted to enter into force as soon as the new legislation in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative counties in Colorado have announced that existing quote marijuana offences and people are still before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, Denvers votes in several cities, from the suburbs to the western mountains, new state licensed marijuana business to the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> and regulators in the state of Washington are confused on the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for a guide to setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug-and have a deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> The view in Washington is that Colorado is in any case most of the states ahead, as regards the regulation of marijuana. There was legalized the drug for medical purposes, and then for private consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. the state lends itself so well to guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith also that there is no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and is also the end of a grey area in the state licensing system does not yet exist, but legalized the possession. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> and unpleasant practice issues have to be resolved in this time-such as the government&apos;s target of a &quot;fair access&quot; to Lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops in a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare should be agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;No, it will be difficult to find a location for a Lizenziertes cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis&apos;, a recently formed group research. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> its staff in Aurora on 21 November, chief Oates sent an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana offences in people over the age of 21 years, and that the police &quot;immediately&quot; will not seek criminal advertisements for these offences. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban targets to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to be monitored. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern colorado County prosecutor Ken buck a stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to encourage consumers to withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people in possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many were also charged for other offences. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, in which the crime was&quot; indeed stage, buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions are, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police circle in grand junction, the largest city of the country, no longer shows adults for the possession of small quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also not decided to drop all outstanding possession proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it is changing,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana to reconcile with the complexities of the Government and the legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> and the contradictory reactions in the whole state promoted among local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> District Prosecutors if it was a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer representing the defendants on trial for marijuana crimes from Denver, and on the ground acting as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for that you still cannot accept the legalization,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The first states, the smaller treat marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington, acted as a national model for the legalisation of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials to prepare a legal age sales, they are also nervous waiting for orders from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level continue to treat as a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> A spokesman for the legalization Movement hope that the Justice Department will give. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama government is of the view that law is probably no doors, reluctant to smaller quantities of drugs seized, but probably will, under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> several cities in Colorado, not even waiting for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the polling day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana business, although this is only open in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Montrose, a town in the west, decided last week to a six-month ban, which will probably be next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to get into a position where we have someone who license and then face a major problem at the federal level,&quot; Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Since then, we have decided, for what the community and not for what the state has decided. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many unanswered questions. </seg>

<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The breed, we are the worst in the world, therefore, we observed that it is a subject that we had to take care of us. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, as for example the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating-evenings (fast flirting). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We thought: why do we not do something as creatively as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap Komponieren? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> If this is not an easy issue, the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Each year, 1 300 US dollars for political measures, in order to encourage the citizens to have more children. </seg>

<seg id="2613"> According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time the rate of fraud-which is also known as the replacement rate-was in 1976. </seg>

<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are long days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> The result of this is that they are much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> He is, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously placed obstacles in the way, if you want to build many small housing units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapore pieces, from working in the financial quarter, that they will not have a major impact. </seg>

<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marie Porras, a teacher of English with degrees in education and learning, believes that the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet emerged as a medium for the search for information, with the appearance of these pages, but the rules of the game have changed,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explains that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master-title in teaching at Yale University and author of the plant &quot;digital natives and immigrants&apos; grew these concepts to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants, who they are, where we are still learning,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He said that it is a complex issue, &quot;because we are asking of you, that you have a defined criteria, what can be said or published, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be pick if it is most important to them, to be loved, thousands have friends, without thinking about the consequences&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the children and young people is the most effective way to teach what privacy, to ask you questions, you think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;You say you should not do, is not working,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras, then some possibilities: there are things you not to tell strangers would, then why do you on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> or: would you like it if you published a photograph of you, such as the one you have published by a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> you have other people asked for permission in advance, if you have photographs of celebrate labelled? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> and one more question: must all be aware of what you do at any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultants, comment, that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If you understand all the parts they have solid foundations for their children to talk about the importance of EröFfnens one user account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age or what parts or publish,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, children of the lesson, &quot;thou shalt not speak with strangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth summit meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and in theory should be signed by the ruling Seven. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> EFE, repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the sixth ordinary session of the heads of state and government leaders of Unasur. Sources in the heads of state and presidents shared services initially that it would be after the conclave on to a certain time, but said then that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> in questions to the text, that the content of the presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was laid out in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists access to information on the summit was limited at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> in the press room during the day, it was only the image of the President meeting without tone with the message &quot;private meeting, limited audio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few information floating around among the journalists, the press from some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> the only document that was prevalent during the day, the list of the participating presidents was what caused unease in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, which called for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> then signalled the presidency of Peru the media an e-mail with the final declaration of the summit, but the statement by Humala and not the official document on the conclusion of the summit meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru was host of the third summit of South American-Arab States (Aspa), and even more forcefully on this occasion, despite calls by the press the so-called declaration of Lima, which it had previously announced, just published. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> on the official website of the Aspa, we can convince that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Two international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities, for journalists, there would be limited but that the information systems in a high level access to the information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Chile and Peru, Ollanta Humala, SebastiáN PiñEra, met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima against Santiago, listen to the pleas on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will judge the differences we currently comply with this international court, and together with his Chilean export,&quot; Humala said. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will remain a country that adheres to the international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and submitting to the international courts,&quot; adds PiñEra and GrüßTe Humala with hands pressure above the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ, happened after Colombia after a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake to take action against the agreement of Bogota had what it agreed to abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice. </seg>

<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, which since 2011 following the dismissal of its President Fernando Lugo is excluded from the Unasur, attended the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president Ollanta Humala, the talks opened in the morning and ended the summit shortly after the midday in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The head of state read the final document, which said that 16 decisions and guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount of $17 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> The decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries&apos; significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that measures would be taken to &quot;cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the city and to improve against organized, transnational crime, and measures to access to medicines and the Internet at low prices to improve in all areas of South America, and to work together in the event of natural disasters and to act effectively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> &quot;The economic consolidation with the crisis in Europe (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but is intended to increase our output and a better future for our peoples,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 flagship projects, the spatial improve connections in South America, and especially in rural and border areas... and therefore our countries to unite and develop new forms of economy,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a statement read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects would also be five Peruvian on the axles across its territory of the coast to Brazil, and with two aims to better link with Ecuador, although he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Also, the final document relating to the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for its re-entry into the Union of South American nations&apos;, from which it is excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America to continue with an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect, which was highlighted at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, said Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he on Saturday in a meeting with his face of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, Mexico expected to the maritime conflict after a Bogotá in question the judgment of the ICJ, respectfully. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Perhaps I will tomorrow (Saturday) meeting with the president Daniel Ortega,&quot; said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways-they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua talks with Nicaragua is needed,&quot; he emphasized. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope the President Ortega to be able to say that we treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; added Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega were meeting in Mexico on Saturday, where they have the intention, the inauguration of the country&apos;s new president, Enrique PeñA Nieto to be present. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit, also met in the run-up to the defence ministers of the bloc for the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, what the dialogue and consensus in regard to the defence of the region can be strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even if the latter is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, &quot;South America can actually learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, of the sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) Summit was held in Lima in Peru, told the state television that the Europeans &quot;in the second world war and other conflicts were killing&quot; and &quot;are now virtually a homeland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the members states of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, however, there is still a reactionary sectors who want to see a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The President of Ecuador, also supported the reform of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take account of those who have signed the San José agreement on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The lessons, never commit themselves to something, and, in return, we sign the South Americans always do everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and will be financed by the United States,&quot; he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, has granted. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa stressed that he did not regret this decision, because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his &quot;complied with deep democratic values and views on human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that there have been &quot;well-founded suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and non-compliance with the procedures.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for him to submit to interrogation because of alleged sex crime on its territory, while the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference on the embassy of Ecuador in London can be carried out. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;since he is in our message is, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious,&quot; said the head of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is a danger, though, that he is physical and mental damage forgiven because he was caught in a narrow area and could not carry out physical exercises in free. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It would be detrimental to the health of all people,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange has been granted since the month of June in the embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of a free letter which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Europe&apos;s Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He emphasised that there have been talks with London in order to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of Wikileaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, we turn this word in this case not to have permanent talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution for this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar GarzóN, a number of procedures at various European bodies,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> and &quot;when Britain granted licence tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> and if Sweden Mr Assange at the embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype VerhöRte made, as the Swedish law permits, and in other cases, was the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate, &quot;the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;the biggest enemy of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists, the pursuit of profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador that not more of such journalists&apos; and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and tables bourgeois countries&apos;, and I think he will be a re-election &quot;will deepen the revolution in order to continue moving in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the legal body must remain &quot;hard and no opportunism and no Verkleideten May coup d&apos;éTat,&quot; because &quot;the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, and now after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which before the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime legal limits between the two countries, for &quot;absolutely justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> This judgment will not be implemented at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a South and Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome in pursuit of a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be dealt with, so that they can be overcome and look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the sea border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said, &quot;it is right for Latin America that recourse to international bodies, if both countries undertake to adopt the ruling, even if it is very harsh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> in relation to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he admitted that he &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy this possibility, though it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> power has never interested me personally, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the belief that I was the likely victory guaranteed, so I must fulfil this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I am back from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This also applies if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is decided,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also adopted to tackle the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I was with the vice-presidents of Venezuela, NicoláS Maduro. He told me that he went for a planned routine treatment that would have expected, and that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;In any case, it means a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader adopted today in Lima on the sixth summit meeting of the heads of state and government of the Union of South American nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The cause of a dying because AIDS is now a late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bombshell,&quot; he says of the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success &quot;tried to weaken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to look just about his illness and began to inform; and that with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fight in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the Imss to adopt &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, there are still many people in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already been damage, your immune system has outlived its usefulness, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> Thirty years after the incidence of AIDS in the world, in other words after the first reported cases, &quot;the great success today means that the survival of patients, the treatment time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information was backed by a prominent scientific publication in April this year. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the damage to the immune system attached to the people at the start of treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above remarks mean that anyone who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the 25 years of age &quot;can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality has decreased significantly in the last few years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to reduce the Onusida 4.862 in 2011 (annual report)), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS died 60% of patients covered in the national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In Jalisco, in 2011 255 people died alone, and until the month of May this year, there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So people still die-why? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and that is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious State, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a striking statement: &quot;nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have a lifelong infection. Earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, why all the people where this is necessary, must be offered screening massively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal, the experts and officials of the consejo estatal de PrevencióN del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, carry out the test at a private laboratory, and the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS-phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and we want to hear. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I die, then three times burst,&quot; says in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The amendment was to improve, I ErnäHre me well, sport and take note of the medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> We now know his parents that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I am standing much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I respect on my health and that of the other person,&quot; one Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to share, with his testimony to encourage those who are today within the framework of the World AIDS Day. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> You should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> his message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are large holes between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has adopted the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> and the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> The increases in certain places, &quot;the distribution of condoms actually was; previously they were individually, now give us packages to hundreds of piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The high-risk individuals for new infections among young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;What need you?&quot; is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, staff orientation in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilets facilities, often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question on whether under its management would be distributed condoms. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;sexuality is not; it is best, the condoms to bring it closer to those who already have a sexual activity&quot;, brought it to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> key data of Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are cases 13.435 accumulated (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> the state National seen in 4 new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in relation to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the infection cases on sex, 6% of the blood and peri-natal 2%. </seg>

<seg id="2877"> &quot;These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships since 1967 of the vaqueros as directors, managers or coaches. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>

<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the dream team. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is the team at the Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold in 1991 and the team the United States offered a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us. </seg>
