<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republican leaders justified their policy by the necessity of fighting against the ballot rigging. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Yet, the Center Brennan considers the latter as a myth, maintaining that the ballot rigging is rarer in the United States than the number of killed people by the lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Moreover, the republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of ballot rigging in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A thing is certain: these new arrangements will influence the rate of participation negatively. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will drain in part the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Contrary to Canada, the American States are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this mind that a majority of American governments promulgated from 2009 new laws making more difficult the process of registration or of vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has seized by the extent after the elections of November 2010 that saw add itself 675 new representing republicans in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 projects of laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced for the only year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws require that the voters present an identity card with photo and a proof of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Besides, these laws also reduce the periods of vote by anticipation, invalidate the right to be noted itself down as voter on the day of the ballot and deprive the citizens having a judicial file of their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no American State required from the voters of presenting an identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first State to put such a particularity. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The High Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities hastened to stretch this practice at other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the course of the two last years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force the voters to present an identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Noticing that, contrary to Quebec, the American citizens do not have universal identity card as the card of the illness assurance is important. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of the American citizens, is 21 million people in age of voting, do not possess identity cards with photo issued by a governmental agency of their State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity papers. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Yet, it costs often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions allocate the youths, the minorities, and the people in a disproportionate way to weak income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of the Afro-Américains, 15% of the people earning less than 35 000 dollars; 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of the voters of 18 to 29 years do not possess the identity card required with photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Well more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, of the voters considered as voter more for the democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with emitted photo by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, these same States allow to the members of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that vote more of the republican side of using to vote the cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to present such a particularity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> For 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring of the voters of proving that they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures aim clearly at limiting the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Yet, him appert that two Hispanic voters on three favor the democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Besides, the republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of the voters on the day of the ballot in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Furthermore, they have limited the right of people and of groups of supplying an assistance to the voters wanting to register itself. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the general election of 2004, the campaigns of registration of the voters have contributed to record 10 million citizens about. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Yet, the measures adopted for 2009 have made to fall of 17% the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 in relation to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Furthermore, the republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States aiming at reducing the period of vote by anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the voters who have voted by anticipation were Afro-Américains, even though the latter represented only 13 % of the voters of the State. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It went similarly with the Hispanic ones. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These did not represent that 11% of the voters, but 24% of citizens who voted by anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In equivalent, the whites that formed 76% of the voters did not represent only 46% of the voters voting by anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters have opposed sturdily the adoption of laws restricting the registration of the voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The general lawyer of the United States is intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They have been able to limit in part the damages. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 on 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photo. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Nevertheless, the new rules set up undeniably are going to make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic criticisms denounce the character partisan of the laws that have been voted for and they see an objective evident of influencing the results in 2012 in key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A relation of the Center Brennan of 2011 demonstrates that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the electoral school to take away the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to maintain with certainty that these legislative modifications as regards the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the presidential elections of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But a thing is certain: these new arrangements will influence the rate of participation negatively. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will drain in part the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Detection of the cancer of the prostate: passing the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the test d&apos;APS would present sometimes erroneous results, with fake negative results or still fake positives, which lead to useless medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Of what to make to hesitate still more the men already reluctant to pass tests of detection. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Passing the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have asked for the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies taken to the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the witness groups, interpreting these farmhouses given and of having recommendations is therefore difficult. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, that European, has decided on a difference of mortality between the patients who have had a detection and those that have not had some. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also has demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that one has between 30 and 40 % of more chances of having metastases if one is not detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I recommend therefore the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if one has a direct parent that already has had a cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of afro-américaine origin are also more to risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is of making the good decision once one has detected a cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers aggressive and of other that are idle. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to make really to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the possible options, not treating necessarily the cancers of the prostate that do not undermine to the life in the long term, and rather opting, in those cases, for a surveillance is activated of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men by whom one detects a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> One is going to suggest to them to make surveillance active and if the illness progresses, one is going to offer them a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More and more, one determines criteria with precision to decide who would owe or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I recommend therefore nevertheless of passing the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important one is of having a discussion with his doctor to determine if one should spend it or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the international Society of urology, Movember has created a tool that allows evaluating the for and the against of the test d&apos;APS. </seg>
<seg id="72"> One can load this document (in English for the moment, a translation will be offered soon) to this address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Warning the illness </seg>
<seg id="74"> There is not unfortunately miracle recipe to warn the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> In spite of the progress of the research, the adoption of good habits of life is the best means of reducing the risks of suffering from it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> One considers that if everybody ate well and moved sufficiently, one could warn 30% about the cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no more nobody smoked, this rate would climb at at least 50%&quot;, underlines André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society of the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the other hand, one evaluates that about 10% of the cancers are caused by the heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several are as totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Society of the cancer, the fight against the nicotine addiction is a priority, in spite of the reduction of the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> The cigarette is related to 85% of the cases of cancer of the lung. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It also constitutes a factor of risk for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> That harms the health of the people enormously. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Still today, there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec&quot;, laments the spokesperson André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging datum: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of a fall cancer of half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The stoutness and the obesity also favor the appearance of the illness, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They would increase the risks of breast cancer, of the colon and of the rectum, of the esophagus, of the pancreas and of the uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;The research demonstrates that the regular practice of the physical activity during a whole life protects from the cancer of the colon&quot;, one adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The feeding </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organism recommends also of limiting his consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too great quantity, it makes climb the risks of being affected of a colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The delicatessen also, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the training of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage the cells of the organism and to take to the development of the cancer&quot;, one explains. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In the course of the last years, several scientists have studied the links between the vitamin supplements and the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their investigations are not though conclusive for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> From the studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Even though one of them noticed a reduction of the risks of cancer of the prostate, another noticed rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Neither the effect of the vitamin D on the cancer is clearly not established. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Besides, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his anxieties and about his family antecedents with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Passing a test of detection, that does not give the cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The boson of decorticated Higgs </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of the boson of Higgs has created a whole emotion, the last summer, and for cause. </seg>
<seg id="106"> One believes indeed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of every thing in the Universe, nothing that that. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then, it is a matter of the last particle of which the existence is foretold by the standard Model - our best, or &quot;less worse&quot; explanation of the nature and of the behavior of the matter - but who has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, it is not still completely sure that it is a matter a lot of Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> One knows beyond all shadow of a doubt that one keeps an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the boson of Higgs foretold by the standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Moreover, new data unveiled this week during a great conference of appearance, in Kyoto, seem to confirm it, but it lacks still the data to be perfectly certain. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Let&apos;s suppose all the same that it is a matter a lot of Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem thin, and let&apos;s see of which it is a matter. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this low world, a wanting fatally inescapable law that two things can not find themselves at the same time to the same place. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Not means of infringing this rule - and do not try too much loudly, you are going to hurt to yourself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yet even if the physics of the particles is a pretty strange world, it proves that it has, it also, a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion from Pauli, who stipulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same moment if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot; consisting roughly in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In a corner, one finds good citizens appointed fermions, which follow the principle of Pauli wisely. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other one do not shake the bosons, a dirty gang of anarchists that do not have of respect for anything in any case, not for this principle, what means that they can be well and truly, at the same time, to the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons divide afterwards into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Laboratories Berkeley: the missounds, which we will not approach here, and the &quot;particles of strength&quot;, by which the great strengths of the nature spread and at which the boson of Higgs would be in a way related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons-là, it must be underlined here, are not everyone of the so exotic creatures that one could believe it. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Actually, if you manage to read this column, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the &quot;particle of light&quot; that is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic strength. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, indeed, a particle having an electric load accelerates or changes direction, that &quot;disturbs&quot; the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit as a pebble thrown to a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Of this &quot;trouble&quot; is born an electromagnetic wave (of the light, either of the infrared one, or of the ultraviolet ray, etc.), and this wave is not anything else than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons &quot;messengers of strength&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> It is similarly with the boson about Higgs, to this difference to that it is another field, the field of Higgs, that must &quot;be disturbed&quot; so that this boson appears. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Yet, this field of Higgs is a lot, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach of very, very high energies, a bit as if it was a matter of a cold pond of which only a very big rock could wrinkle the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> It is why an immense accelerator of particles is needed as that of the CERN - the Wide Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relation between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It is not indeed all the particles, or all the materials, which interacted with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, as the magnets, make it, but of others not - an end of paper, for example, will never take after itself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, it is not all the particles that people interact with the field of Higgs: those that make it have a mass, even though the others (as the photon, hold out) do not have some. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Maintaining, how much all these investigations &quot;can bring&quot;, asks for Mme Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science, that uses to verify the validity of the standard Model (MSEC), and that allows to also the physicists to scrutinize every gap between the observations and the predictions of the MSEC. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover they are several to wish burningly that one finds, because the lesser difference could open a door on a &quot;physical news&quot; and block some holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, has still enormous deficiencies, not proposing any explanation for the gravity (oups!) or the dark matter, which forms 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!) about. </seg>
<seg id="135"> But one has not found such gaps to the CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Repercussions </seg>
<seg id="137"> The repercussions of these investigations in the daily of mister and madam Tout-le-Monde, they, are more difficult to foretell, but one would be wrong of presuming that some will not be. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Hold out: to the beginning whole of the years 60, the pioneers of the laser, in the Laboratories Bell, did not suspect at all the revolution that their works were going to start. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They anticipated some of the scientific applications, but nothing of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Actually, already has told fire to us the physicist Willard Boyle - that has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who has shone-even designed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, to the departure the laser rather was seen than a &quot;gizmo of labo&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, the applications can also come from the whole instrumentation that surrounds the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, this same Willard Boyle has designed a small sensor of light in 1969, in the course of his works in optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, well that it was not at all his original intention, uses now of &quot;eye&quot; to all the digital cameras of the world, and has been it worth the Nobel of appearance 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> That does not mean of course that the activities of the LHC are necessarily going to transform our lives, but that means that, really, one never knows... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - The best way of dying... | The Duty </seg>
<seg id="147"> With his Commission to die in the dignity, Quebec lately has discussed the delicate question of the end of the life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must recover soon even though a bill gets ready. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Yet, in this essential domain, much stay to make. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The Duty has tried to bother about it furthermore to. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Some weeks ago hardly, Mister L. lived still alone in his apartment of the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The cancer of the prostate that ate into it had left him a respite of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They had given five years to me to live, I have made seven years&quot;, it calls, neither fish nor fowl, laid down in his bed at home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, of Beloeil, where it has happened the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it is always a shock, one can not be prepared for that&quot;, it says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The illness makes his work: an enormous weakness that prevents it from making oneself alone to the bathroom, and even of eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sat at the table in front of an appetizing breakfast, he accepts to let itself help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Brave, he manages even to smile, talks to the strangers who bustle about around it, bring his medicines to him, offer a bath to him. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish, it is that one cures me of the diarrhea, it is humiliating&quot;, it entrusts. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Some hours more late, l&quot;équipe has taken on a remedy for this harm. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;In the course of our life, one learns that a man, that pees standing&quot;, tells Brodeur Stone, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To regress at the stadium of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;That depends on the capacity of the person&quot; to accept the regression, he notices. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, from the opinion of several people striving in palliative care, great moments take place at the heart even of this regression. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who enter at home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer everyone of the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a forecast of maximum life of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stadium, l&quot;équipe of doctors and of nurses that surrounds them does not give care called &quot;curative&quot; anymore. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mme A., 89 years, the worst fear is of dying &quot;conscious and suffocated&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the illness has made me uncover my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children&quot;, it adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I do not have more wishes in the life,&quot; it says, before accepting that one puts a mask to him to help him to breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She expects all the same, in the next days, a last visit from his son come from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In Victor-Gadbois, one gives, with a group of voluntary, the care of the body and the help to the feeding. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is the palliative care, which one gives when there is not anything more else to make. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make the death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, one counts a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very little when one knows that everyone end up dying a day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, the life continues in the best conditions possible, explains the Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> That it is physical, emotional or spiritual as regards the comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> To the dying man, one will accept to give care of mouth to the brandy or to the Pepsi, according to the request. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics will not be obliged anymore to control their rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of the daily. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday night, one has served a beer to Mr. X, died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it is his son that will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;One helps the close relations as much as the patients do&quot;, tells Nathalie Savard, manager of the care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> At home Victor-Gadbois, the days follow themselves but do not resemble. </seg>
<seg id="187"> To the sides of an old man of 93 years who savors his last assembly of family in the court, well wedged in his pillows while one drinks in his honor, a young man of 36 years dies itself tragically, surrounded with his parents, with his woman and with his two young children, after having tempted everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;Since six months, there are of three to five beds always that are occupied by cancerous aged of less than 45 years&quot;, worries the Dre Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the patients that is admitted at home Victor-Gadbois arrive of their domicile, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to the palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> One says that 77% of the Canadians do not have everything simply not access to palliative care, in other words to conceived care to appease the suffering while a patient is an upstart to the terminal stage of his life, which it is to domicile, to the hospital or in house of care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organisms, as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at domicile of the Great Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to the cancerous ones. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in the care of Quebec French health that makes to fear to several specialized doctors in palliative care the adoption of a law framing the euthanasia and the attended suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed of experts of the palliative care of which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to reveal their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to the Dre Christiane Martel, the system of Quebec French health is not efficient enough to assure that each will have right to palliative care of quality before one accepts to conduct the euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Lately, it says, I have seen a patient spend 14 days to the urgency, in great pains, without one doing what is necessary to relieve it. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients ask to die only because they do not receive the appropriate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And in parallel, several oncologists strive against their patients until the last day, in spite of the worst forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal while it has abandoned a testing chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> While I have announced to my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, it has replied to me that she regretted I stopping fighting, it has told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Nevertheless, it had called me that finished j&quot;étais! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Dre Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank the nursing ones for not having reached their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it is needed to say well about the pain that the palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, manager of the palliative care to the Society of palliative care at domicile of the Great Montreal, the patients would be resistant to the treatments against the pain in 8% of the cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> To the all end of the life, the doctors have then often resort to the palliative sedation, which amounts to putting the patient to sleep until the moment of his death, or in a sporadic way, or in a permanent way. </seg>
<seg id="207"> One can not make of the suffering anymore semblance of not hearing that part. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more, the not relieved patient is going to have the possibility of having this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not mean necessarily &quot;I want that you perform me euthanasia&quot;, that wants &quot;to say&quot; me want &quot;to be relieved&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism of the Institutes of research in health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Property scandals of great extent in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Of the officials of the road, of the contractors of the BTP, of the collectors of fund of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a tremendous &quot;system&quot;, mixing industry of the building trade, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry&quot; that has cost very expensive to the Quebecois taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is curious as the system breaks up since one has taken the great means&quot;, gibes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy to Quebec and previous leader of police of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is by it that the scandal is has burst into 2011, by the device of an inquiry of bottom on the malpractices related to the contracts of roadworks in Quebec, which the liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented to only backwards. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;relation Duchesneau&quot; established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and corruption of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;From the beginning of the inquiry in 2010, it underlines, the only ministry of the transports would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts, some holding back their instincts to touch a share! </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau &quot;already &quot;has made to beat two mayors&quot;, add him, hoping that she manages &quot;to demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> A unity perms anticorruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The Unity perms anticorruption, created in 2011, gets down to it also with his army of controllers, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> More the policemen of &quot;the Hammer squad&quot; that, for 2009, would have driven the &quot;cartel of the sewers&quot; of Montreal to put the sweet pedal on the inflations of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="223"> These last weeks, it has conducted searches in series and carried accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal elected representatives, as Frank Zampino and Layer Moneybags, mayor of a city of suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The neighbor on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected of having pocketed containers-of-wine repeatedly in return for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Formally are accused besides engineers to the road of Montreal and contractors of Italian origin, of which Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has made sensation explaining on commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; of obtainment of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Itself has poured for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary related to the mafia that paid back the Montreal money to Union, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> M. Zambito has sown to all winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He confessed also to have organized a collection of illegal funds for the ex-vice-Prime Minister Liberal, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Contracts of sewers whose costs it inflated </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked briskly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, ex-engineer in public works, has well detailed it in the face of the commission: in ten years, it has received of presents building firms, invitations at journeys, tournaments of golf, restoring, matches of hockey and containers-of-wine totalizing 736 000 dollars, in return for contracts of sewers whose costs it inflated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the road have confessed to have made itself the leg to get greasy swelling from 30% to 40% the bills, by fake extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of having deliberately closed the eyes on a parallel budget feeding his crates desks with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Subsequent to these revelations, Mr. Tremblay has resigned beginning November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau has been one of the first elected representatives of Montreal to get out of alarm the bell. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, it revolts from 2010 against the sale of a bought municipal ground 5 million of dollars and resold... 1,6 million to promoters, in full property boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in the election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> Of the inquiry that will finally be set up, she says that she &quot;pulls a thread allowing understanding the working about the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to pin the guilty ones.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, it says, is &quot;painful but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> One is cleaning the wound but a unity of inquiry own to Montreal and an eve would be needed, not to see the dubious practices come back. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As one makes the household. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau notices from his side that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but it worries especially about the role of &quot;elected representatives to the current of the stratagem&quot;, when they did not soak in the skulduggery! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Valuing election campaigns at 70% the part of dirty money in the financing in Quebec, he gibes: &quot;One has told to me that it was only a pale reflection of the reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebecois government offers to limit to 100 dollars the gifts to the parties but that will not change not gives it, according to it: &quot;As long as one will not limit strictly the electoral expenses, dirty money will be in policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> Advocates it a complete review of the system of concession of public contracts and of financing of the parties: &quot;One can not go lower; going to the bottom of the things, with courage, will allow rebuilding the house on more solid bases, with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this history tarnishes the international picture of Quebec and of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those that laugh at it to concern court in their specificity... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken a new wingspan with the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> One can explain it by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I progress at their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has me also much brought. </seg>
<seg id="257"> At the daily, these elements drive me to hoist my level of game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything goes in a very fast way in the foot. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not blaze. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Of my beginnings at the center of preformation of the INF Clairefontaine at my passage in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced through landings. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You pull therefore benefit of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits of this summer are accustomed to arguing about the matches of very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is crucial-critical. </seg>
<seg id="265"> It that makes that a player as me has desire of facing and of supplying the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Besides, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot as for my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played at the same post as I. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Is Ancelotti the man of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires the respect by all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, it does not have equal in League 1 and is part of the best European trainers. </seg>
<seg id="272"> It has a great experience and has won many titles with classy clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He has walked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that it will take away other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had had a comforting discussion with it. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I went out then from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust that he gives me also explains my performances. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What glance you carry on the first part in season of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1, Lyons has taken the place of leader from us. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we stay in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our major objectives is the League of the champions: we are us qualified for the 8th of finale with the way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> One is going to try to go the more far possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Henceforth, everything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But one will have our word to statement opposite very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to finish first first of our hen, in front of Oporto, to be able to receive during the 8th of return finale. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a great European club, Paris needs to take away titles and to be in line with the duration. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG works hard the means so that this project materializes. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In League 1, not to take away the title, as the last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, that would represent a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, one has really seriously to pocket this title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, one is not pasts far. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there has been disappointment because one had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> One has made a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> One has finished points with 79. </seg>
<seg id="299"> In a normal way, with 79 points, one is supposed to be first-rate... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has realized a still more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think that it is the domestic. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams as Marseille, Lyons or Bordeaux are to the fight for the title, I think that one has the weapons to take it. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you consider that the media wait for too much of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that one waits for many of us considering what has been surrounded and of the players that one has. </seg>
<seg id="305"> One totally accepts it. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After, while one wins 4-0 to domicile against Troyes and that one finds still of the things to reproach for us, it is sure that it is a little disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what the people wait for furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="308"> Never one will be able to win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> One is not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> One tries to set up a project of game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with the time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> One has proved in Ligue champions that one could reply presents. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City that does not arrive, for two seasons, to qualify itself for the 8th of finale, also they have made enormous expenses! </seg>
<seg id="314"> With regard to the surrounded sums, one imagined you with 15 points in advance to the truce! </seg>
<seg id="315"> Neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France was. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyons and Marseille, which were not well the last season, have been &quot;boostés&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> That shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that at the month of May we will be able to have the smile telling ourselves that, in spite of all the difficulties, one has ended up taking it. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better that one says that there is a &quot;Zlatan dependence&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> That means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he puts many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It has come for that and it proves that he is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> It has demonstrated partout où it is passed that he was a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, one respects the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> It also respects the men that it has around it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What it has made is really exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> That drives the others to hoist their level of game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, allows also everybody to progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you lived the Euro 2012 with the team of France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had seriously to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from gleaning time of game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things over there and I have taken out some reinforced. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I manage to realize good matches in selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> It is what I hoped for for my baptism with the Blues. </seg>
<seg id="336"> One has gotten out the lessons of what has happened in Ukraine and one is owed itself today of having an exemplary behavior. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What glance do you carry towards the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It has the results as it. </seg>
<seg id="339"> One is well put in the qualifying group for that World. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires wins it. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc was it. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make of comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had reached his objective in us qualifying for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The good none (1-1) extracted, on October 16th, in Spain it constitutes a founder match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us trust. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each has fought for everybody. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived on similar match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, to pay and to sell without the banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> Just the opposite of the present monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and expenses of treatment between the setting parts. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the present monetary system, fact of banked monopolies, drives to the financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Actually, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a protocol of exchange secured to the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files hand in hand to peer. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200 000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15 000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Small a thousand sites Web accept the bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The lesson of the bitcoin, after having reached a summit of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, has fallen at 2 dollars, five months later, before coming back today from dollars (the lessons are counted on the site bitcoincharts.com) around ten. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing of very impressive, compared with the world exchanges in real currency or in produced financiers. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (BCE) has been interested in it in a relation on the virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes bitcoin as &quot;the virtual currency having the biggest success&quot;, &quot;in competition with the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin distinguishes itself of other types of virtual currency as the &quot;credits&quot;, used to progress in a video game that one wins playing or that one can buy (and to exchange sometimes en retour). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But, every time, a central authority controls and treats the exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin, all the knots of the network are at the same time emitting depositories of the accounts book, controllers, of currency, both purchasers and salesmen. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network work? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users is made in reality between two electronic mail to the way of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for every payment, assuring thus the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A unity of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of encoding at key copy. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, checking that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public accounts book, broadcast in all the network, is as possible. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The stage-key consists in writing this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It is taken by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched at the computers, and whose winner, kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a matter of a stage of mincing of file, in other words of transformation of a big file in a shorter and unique numeric imprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add it a number before &quot;chopping&quot; the unity. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The being goal of finding a particular imprint the number that gives (a lot of zéros initially). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number has been taken on, the other knots check easily-off that it is the good one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then to the chain of the unity of the other transactions related indestructiblement; every modification would change the imprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay two times with the same money in a very fast way (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other orphan rest because the two have different imprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer having solved the challenge takes away 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid the inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited at 21 million, but they are divisible up to the one hundredth millionth, what leaves margin... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to every increase of the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had tops and bottoms. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Of the sites Web supplying the services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins in stolen deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used fault does not concern the protocol itself&quot;, insures Pierre Noizat, who has just thrown Paymium, a firm of payment in true currency using the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The BCE states also the possibilities of laundering of money thanks to this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash possesses also this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Actors of weight as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, as the platform of blogs WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Lately, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Institute Weizmann in Israel, have analyzed the accounts book and shown that close to 80% bitcoins do not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, &quot;gigantic sales&quot; have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars have been &quot;exchanged&quot;&quot;, looks forward Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent to a credit card (in true mints) or to a payment by motive without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which come back thus less expensive. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The messenger manages furthermore his identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to make use by the traders, who do not need to install of new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> It suffices to them to communicate an address that a telephone can photograph &quot;and to recognize&quot;, clarifies Pierre Noizat, which assures to have thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general movement of questioning of the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Time will be needed so that Bitcoin dominates, but 2013 could be a turn&quot;, it foretells. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The BCE, in his relation, plans moreover to revalue the diverse risks, today considered as raised, in the event of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We have left from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> The French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Overobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> The Otan and the Americans should follow end 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army recovers possession of his territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without expecting everything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is especially the Afghan farmers that we have punished considering them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, and the casualties, the disabled persons. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban ones consist of foreign extremists, of previous refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often of farmers who refuse the presence armed foreign country, as time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadistes, Pakistani, Arabic, Uzbek, Tajikistani. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes helped by the local insurgents, these will not be it more when the Western ones will make more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, which I have observed of the top hills hammered with almonds thanks to French credits, has made to itself in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and of armored have joined Kabul without being attacked, flown over by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Breaker of the Taliban ones on Kabul from the end of 2014 will not be. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The circumstances have changed 1994 to 1996 from their irresistible overhang. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was then space, the country to fire and to blood because of the fights among different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their capture of control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of release, a return to the safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these farmers overtaken by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Ancients mujahiddin, Afghan government and present Taliban are joined itself in the desire to keep the women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main notables of the anti-Soviet war have come back to the power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They are transformed themselves into hucksters, seizing governmental ground to resell them in grounds to build to the refugees come back of Iran and of Pakistan, benefiting d&quot;énormes American contracts of subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have discredited themselves; most of them have not fought moreover themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The people, as I have heard it in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not appointed of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many youths want to leave, as those will leave that have known to take advantage of the American generosity: the capital evasion is sizeable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The youths are tired of the war and of his ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have walked with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or in Pakistan, they have appreciated the advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population has less than 25 years; Kabul counts now 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the governmental schools are full, of girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> Work will have to be supplied to these youths that will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders anymore. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed opponents, are greedy for portable telephones; the television, and his Turkish serials that present a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will the authorities that are going to order it be considered as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Previous majors of the anti-Soviet fight see already about reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of the western nations, but the United States have wanted to transform it into a State centralized, to strong presidential power, removing the post from Prime Minister that existed from the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The president Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections foreseen in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his east country, for the years 50 and already well before, dependent on the foreign help. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has been replaced on the way, no dam is in state, no important system of irrigation is made up for. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is caused, except fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to the private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by thirty years of war, a governmental control on the infrastructures would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise has been spilled that Afghanistan possessed immense mining riches. </seg>
<seg id="439"> That it has made only to add to the feeling only the Western ones n&quot;étaient there only to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat the iron ore or of copper on site, nor of means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is not exploitation open mine. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have nearly left already the expression of copper of Mes Aynak, letting the international archeologists (financed by the World Bank) search the immense Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> A day will be needed well also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, of which depend largely importations and exportations, restore normal relations. </seg>

<seg id="453"> Even though Egypt remains more divided than never around the constitutional declaration, which agrees him the full powers provisionally, he has decided to play his va-tout. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Taking on everybody of court, it has announced, Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote his final text the day after. </seg>
<seg id="455"> There is everything fair a week, the leader of the State had matched two additional months to this Assembly to finish his works. </seg>
<seg id="456"> This is you are are soon two years that Egypt leans on a provisional text, several times amended it that weakens the institutional stability and drives to legal messes. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has made only to increase the fracture in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the President perseveres in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing betray his word&quot; and of &quot;stamping the right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> From the side of his partisans, one assures that putting an end to the institutional crisis as soon as possible is a means and talks about politics, accelerating the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be organized in the fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way of finding a legitimity popular and democratic then that the protest makes rage in the whole country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced of the Egyptians voting favorably, as he has asserted it in an interview at the American weekly magazine Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Especially as this resort to a fast vote takes after the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Or you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers&quot;, these supposedly having to take end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, to great majority Islamist, have voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most of the Liberals neglected the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Mid-November, little before the constitutional declaration, they had banged the door, considering not to have been able to bring out their sights. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of the human rights, of the religious minorities or of the non-trading company had made some similarly. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the necessary quorum is affected, 11 people, of the replacing members, have been added in a rush, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Without surprise, it is the most often unanimously that the articles have been voted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators moreover have enjoyed themselves of the fact that one of the only divergences of the day has expressed itself around... the hour of the prayer, some members of the committee considering that the clock of the constituent one was badly ordered. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still d&quot;être voted for yesterday night by train, comprises 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of all the gestures, the article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that &quot;the principles of the sharia are the main source of the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> The parties salafistes, for whom l&quot;établissement of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace &quot;the principles&quot; with &quot;the rules&quot;, what would have allowed a stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a security of their goodwill and of their respect of the other components of the Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy&quot;, reply the Liberals, who see only a blow of communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They aim notably at the article 220, which confers a consultative role at the university Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of the laws with the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because &quot;the called people has to pronounce are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimity. </seg>
<seg id="481"> One can see the beginnings of a theocracy&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="486"> But it admits &quot;that there can be an ambiguity around the article 220, because the used terms borrow monk from the vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> One makes reference to the &quot;fiqh&quot; notably [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And the question would be able in future to land of knowing in what measure of the civil judges are competent to pronounce itself top&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Beyond his religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the extensive powers that he gives to the president of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brothers bring out that these are clearly reduced in comparison with what they were under the old system. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Other contentious point: the powers conferred to the army. </seg>
<seg id="492"> In accordance with the wish for the servicemen, the examination of the budget of the Defense will not be subjected to the Parliament, but to a national Advice of defense. </seg>

<seg id="495"> The offense of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is henceforth prohibited, what could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, from the press notably. </seg>

<seg id="608"> The problems land for the migrants without profession, without training, those that do not experience the language and that do not have medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of the language, assure Sebelev, the migrant future is destined to cross dishonest people who, under the pretense of helping it, will supply a &quot;journey&quot; to him in an overpopulated house where it and tens of his fellow men will torment themselves for months without food and without paper and will have to slave away between 12 and 14 hours a day. </seg>

<seg id="613"> Though, of numerous nationals of the republics of Central Asia that wish to come to earn money in Russia entrust that they do not experience not only not the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> It is not of course their mistake, but well their misfortune: little of Turkmènes, Uzbeks, Tajikistanis can allow to themselves to follow it would not be that an acceptable primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not have even of what to feed their children without speaking of dressing them correctly and of equipping them for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they arrive at the adolescence, these youths leave to earn money as soon as the occasion appears. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when one does not know the language, they entrust. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel weak and diminished&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> The human rights campaigners notice though an important aspect of the law relative to the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The examinations will be intended uniquely to the migrants who possess a legal statute. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without statute, examination nor official work will be thereafter. </seg>

<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explain that obtaining an official statute in Russia is not so easy. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason? The administrative fences and always these linguistic difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Furthermore, the legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 milles roubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And then, one can obtain a fake recording rapidly only for 1 500 roubles. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The Russian policemen know that we have fake documents, which we do not have recording, of where the cases of extortion. </seg>

<seg id="630"> &quot;Make in a fast way, do not skimp and buy you a beautiful work of art&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> From the first day of the application of the law relative to the language, one has discovered that the papers of recording of the migrants were not the only ones to be fake. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several fake certificates of examinations of languages have already been confiscated by the employees of the federal service of the migrations. </seg>
<seg id="633"> The falsified papers go out from an ordinary color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners have not had them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate thus the task of the examinations to itself has had to pay seven thousand roubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> They are two times and a half more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost three thousand roubles to the migrant worker. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The representatives of the power and the human rights campaigners agree to say that the objective in the short term is of protecting the system from the corruption so that it is impossible to buy simply these &quot;ends of paper&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give the time to the migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first blow to follow lessons of language. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Furthermore, the immigrants who do not know the Russian will see themselves be proposed a work in domains that do not imply of communicating actively with the people. </seg>

<seg id="640"> The part of the crimes implying legal weapons is very weak </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Russian Ministry of the Inside offers to harden the law contrary to the messengers of civil weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Such a is the reaction of the authorities in view of recent incidents: that it is a matter of the shootings carried out during the marriages or of the killings organized by the moscovite lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has made seven dead men persons. </seg>

<seg id="644"> The idea has been supported by the leader of the committee of the Douma for the safety and the fight against the corruption, Irina Yarovaya that has promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would soon be introduced to the Douma of State. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Everybody is not satisfied with seeing that the Russian authorities try to solve the problem &quot;gripping live it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> An open letter has appeared on the Net one in which his authors, of the representatives of diverse centers of shootings, require of abandoning &quot;this insane hardening&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, has declared Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and specialist in the crime for the BBC to the Russian service. </seg>

<seg id="651"> Though, the Ministry of the Interior maintains that he controls the diffusion of the illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> The purveyors: from the factory to the officer </seg>
<seg id="653"> The black market of the weapons is supplied via several canals. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The main canals are to the number of five, tells Victor Baranets, colonel to the retirement having served ten years to the Ministry of the Education and to the Headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="655"> Capture from screen long trek of a site taking commands of weapons </seg>
<seg id="656"> The first is &quot;the military trace&quot;, in other words arm them that have been flown during the military operations in Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="657"> &quot;These weapons have been stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians&quot;, explains Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The second type of weapons stemming from the black market are those stolen by the criminals to the police. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranets explains that it is a matter also many weapons stolen in the stocks of the police that those hidden directly from the representatives of the police. </seg>
<seg id="660"> The illegal pistols leave for sale from the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many of the latter have often undergone explosions. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;Versions vouched for indicate that some fires have been started deliberately to conceal the deficit&quot;, explains the military antiques. </seg>
<seg id="663"> For Baranets, the manufacturers of weapons are to it for something. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;One sees of the factories of private weapons that do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, notably in Moscow,&quot; tells an expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> One of the other sources of the black market is the smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="666"> An important part of pistols and of submachine guns comes from the poor countries, as the Kirghizie. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;One finds a production local, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supplying&quot;, adds the military antiques. </seg>
<seg id="668"> From where do the weapons come? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts have evaluated the rough part of every source of the illegal weapons on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> A relation on the question has been constituted in 2011 by the Center of analysis of the problems and of study for the public administration. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Specialists have analyzed the relations of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, the criminal files and the public data of the portals relative to the weapons. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The great majority of the illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes of the army and of the police. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of the present weapons on the black market has found there &quot;by mistake of the employees whose work is related to the weapons&quot;, one explains in the relation. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the moment of the fabrication and 5% stem from &quot;secret searches&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> A salesman and consultant of an arms factory having asked to keep the anonymity assures that for well long nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists in the secret search; they are too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The most often, according to it, the salesmen are going to look for the new merchandise in the military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="677"> The person buys by the intermediary of one sign a unity, for example a pistol TT. </seg>
<seg id="678"> One delivers it it passing the merchandise by a wire netting. </seg>
<seg id="679"> &quot;It transports it downtown and resells it for 900 € by the unity with two loaders&quot;, it tells. </seg>
<seg id="680"> &quot;It is truth that the police know of all the businesses, thus, when crimes are on the point to be clarified, she carries out a purchase of control next to the traders of illegal weapons&quot;, adds the salesman. </seg>
<seg id="681"> &quot;As in a store of luxury&quot; </seg>
<seg id="682"> The salesman and the purchaser feel generally by the device of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="683"> I have consulted sites, of the blogs, until a type appears and proposes me of coming to the station of Begovaya where somebody became to take me in a &quot;corner&quot; to bargain. </seg>
<seg id="684"> The price of the pistol, one has given it to me on site </seg>
<seg id="685"> Victor Baranets in military observer </seg>
<seg id="686"> To take on a pistol, I must know somebody that has a contact, he explains the salesman. I know somebody, but I do not trust to him. </seg>
<seg id="687"> There are salesmen on the markets, but over there it is needed also to come saying for example &quot;On behalf of such a person, which has asked to me to transmit that his girl has lost a tooth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Now I buy even a pair of American fists with the aid of a person to whom I trust. </seg>
<seg id="689"> It hands me over them only to me because he knows that I will not give it. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The new small ones look for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> The military antiques Victor Baranets are tried itself as purchaser of illegal weapons in the middle of the years 1990 while it got ready for publishing an article on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="692"> The diagrams, according to it, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> One has given him a photo album in which there was &quot;all what one wants&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I believed me in a store of luxury&quot;, remembers the serviceman. </seg>
<seg id="695"> There is not secret for the purchaser, explains Baranets, everything one can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> As potential customer, I do not content myself with buying, one goes with the salesman in forest and one installs a target. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;One lets me pull and when I am convinced of the weapon working well, one&quot; starts negotiating, described the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> A store from his sofa </seg>
<seg id="699"> The search engines display the sites and the groups on Vkontakte where one can buy weapons &quot;for different uses&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="700"> For that, one does not need any document and anybody to meet. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;It suffices to have a precise sum of money&quot;, one writes in advertisement on the site &quot;To buy a pistol or a submachine gun of fighting&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The users leave their request there and ask their questions. </seg>
<seg id="703"> And does one sell to the minors? </seg>
<seg id="704"> &quot;Without license, of course&quot;, asks for the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (preserved spelling). </seg>
<seg id="705"> Buy TT. Moscow &quot;written &quot;Fedorenkov&quot; in his very direct request. </seg>
<seg id="706"> The federal Service of safety has broadcast an immense network of fake sites and picks up at the spade the people anxious to buy weapons of fighting. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The people pounce on the food as hungry wolves and afterwards they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia </seg>
<seg id="708"> Victor Baranets, observer and military antiques </seg>
<seg id="709"> I have intended to talk about this type of diagrams: generally, the site is recorded out of the field of application of the Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People take the commands. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The purchaser carries out the payment on the automatic milestones. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;It receives en retour a photo and indicating instructions where the weapon is hidden&quot;, explains the secretary of the association&quot; right to a weapon&quot;, Dmitry Kislov. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Victor Baranets maintains that applying on the site, one can meet itself without weapon and behind the bars. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The federal Service of safety has broadcast an immense network of fake sites and picks up at the spade the people anxious to buy weapons of fighting. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The people pounce on the food as hungry wolves and afterwards they find to exploit coal in Siberia&quot;, - it asserts. </seg>
<seg id="716"> A Makarov for 100 dollars </seg>
<seg id="717"> The purchase of an illegal firearm, value the experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to Dmitry Kislov of the association &quot;Right to a weapon&quot;, one can buy a pistol Makarov for 100-300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> A month and a half will have to be waited for about. </seg>
<seg id="720"> He has taken out warehouses long duration by the direction of these warehouses of size obtains. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official data of the ministry, in relation to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes on the whole has dropped in Russia by 7% and rises at 22.9 milles while the proved cases of flight and of extortion of weapons, of ammunitions, of explosive substances and of bombs has lowered of 7,8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> United States: the employees of the fast-foods and of the supermarkets are in strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Close to a quarter of the American adolescents pass by a work of cashier to McDonald sec </seg>
<seg id="724"> These last days, a wave of protests has gone up against the low salaries practised by the supermarkets Walmart and the famous chains of fast restoration such as McDonald sec, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the time being, nobody can foretell if this wave is going to take extent or exhaust itself rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by the unions and some number of associations of left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Parallel with the pay rise modest that perceive the wage earners of base at Walmart and in the chains of fast restoration, the organizers of the demonstrations wish to obtain the creation from unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector is not covered for the moment by the union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 a hundred per annum? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The demonstrations have begun the last week, after Thanksgiving, on the &quot;black Friday&quot;, at the moment where a rain erupting of sales seizing millions of inhabitants has descended on America and starting sometimes scenes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some wage earners of the society Walmart, which uses 2,2 million people in the world, have left their post to organize pickets with the unions and the activists of left in the stores of the society whose products are intended to the consumers of the modest classes and to averages. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart markets everything: of the coats to the hunting guns going by by the batteries kits of car, the vacuum cleaners, the eggs and the milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% at less expensive 27% than in the great supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> It is why many wage earners badly paid at Walmart make their races uniquely on their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of the products have made of Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to the criticisms, Walmart can allow to itself to sell his products good market notably because of the low salaries of his employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter complain also about the difficult conditions of work, for example of the lack of forklift trucks or of portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the demonstrations of the &quot;black Friday&quot; asked for a pay rise, they have complained about the fact that the price of the medical assurance supplied by the firm had increased in 30 to 100 dollars by month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> For the wage earner of base by Walmart that affects 9.5 $ of the hour, it is not a sum that it can not allow itself. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists of the californienne university of Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary at 12 $ of the hour, that would cost 3,2 billion dollars to the group. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It is 1,1% of more of what it spends presently. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred the whole pay rise on the shoulders of the consumers, every race in the store would fall to them to 46 a hundred furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars of more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The partisans of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests have taken place only in nine States and have not carried any damage to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> On the &quot;black Friday&quot; people have continued in the stores of 8 hr the night at midnight the day after and Walmart has sold towards this period 5000 articles at the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> His crates desks have carried out in all 100 million transactions for the &quot;black Friday&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesperson of the society Dan Fogleman has assured in an interview to the site of left Huffington Post that &quot;less than five&quot; wage earners in all of Walmart had left their posts and&quot; that the protest was only an &quot;operation of com&apos; among so many of others&quot; on behalf of the organizing union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Next customer&quot;! </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests have continued this week in New York and did not concern either the stores Walmart (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, it is why yet they are not introduced) but the McDonald sec and other restaurants good market. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald sec announces to sell billions of portions and after they do not give even sick leave to you and do not pay the work that you have done honestly to you! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, member of the Town Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Presently, the minimum salary foreseen by the federal legislation and that of New York is of 7.25 $ of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The fast-foods increase them with the time, but of little, on average his employees of base touch to New York 8.90 $ of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody touches less than they do in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me living with this sum in New York is inconceivable. </seg>
<seg id="756"> It was a time where nearly a quarter of the American adolescents worked at McDonald sec after the secondary school all living at their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw their main source of incomes or wished to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find to interview wage earners of McDonald sec that complain about having to live with this salary and about sometimes having to feed their children with. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal one finds comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with which you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The demonstrators that have launched the movement Thursday to 6h30 close to the McDonald sec of the 40th street and on Madison Avenue required that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast-food are paid at least 15 $ of the hour, or a multiplication more of two times than the present minimum salary. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They asked also to what are created for unions in the sector of the fast restoration. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The American law forbids to the administration of to make obstacle and of punishing the protesters for a union by vexations or dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Though, the administration seldom simplifies them the life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a union, to seize the fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main ones is the extraordinary one rotation of the staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They are not agreed </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other tumultuous demonstrations were held close to several of other chains of fast restoration. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The headlight moment of the protest has been the union in environment of day close to the McDonald sec of Times Square with the intervention of several democratic policies places, notably that of Jumaane Williams, member of the Town Council, that has declared: &quot;McDonald sec announces to sell billions of portions and after they do not give even sick leave to you and do not pay the work that you have done honestly to you&quot;!. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators have been supported by other New-York democrats in sight, notably by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who has declared that &quot;everyone must support us the wage earners of the fast restoration so that they obtain a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times has characterized this demonstration as the most important that the sector of the fast restoration in all his history has experienced. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only some hundred people has participated in it without counting that everyone were not wage earners of fast-food, who use tens of thousands of people for New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Saying if this spark of movement of mass will make small ones is for the moment difficult. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;For the time being, one manages only averagely to deceive the brain&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Recently, the fans of the new technologies are themselves accustomed to perceiving the reality increased through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> To the departure, it is Google that has unveiled this summer her present model during his annual conference and in November one has learned that Microsoft had made the request for the diploma. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Though, it emerges from the maintenance with the manager of the group of technologies of interactive 3D of the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already old history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the perspective of handling virtual objects in the air to naked hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - You could tell us in some words what your group of research makes? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We work on the interaction between the man and the machine and we try in the same time to broaden the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The humanity in his unity has stayed for the time being to the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the tactile one. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5 to 10 years in front of us and to guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the console Xbox and the sensors Kinect constitute a step forward, and nearly no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everybody is interested in the command by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - How reserves us also the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Although the Kinect has made the interaction physical, many things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change that and we truly work on systems of imagery 3D working on different technologies, notably the technologies of projection. </seg>
<seg id="787"> One must make to take out the computer world in ours, in the physical world, to make it more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For that, though, not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it must be identified. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we will be able to complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And to begin, we dispose of those stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think from the vocal command? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but it is not overestimated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> One can not say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality lands because one does not have always desire of informing the others of his actions or of his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Actually, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in his kennel. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to order the devices in the public places, we had a project for which we thought about gestures, not of the broad gestures, but rather to discreet gestures, limited. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet carried by hand that recorded the movements of the bones and of the muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is presently big, but reducing it to the size of a watch is theoretically possible. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Actually, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - In other words? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, in what way you would wonder me of passing you this can? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would make it with the word and with the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - In a usual way, I speak only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that is going to be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Therefore, you want to force the users to adapt according to what the machine can or not to make at a given moment? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not compulsorily, but it is a matter of a mutual reconciliation. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that very soon we will have to work on the elaboration of new types of sensors that will allow us to identify better the reactions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It can be a matter for example of the sensors laser, they cause a good enough resolution in depth and it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If one is interested in your work on the sensors Xbox Kinect, how much you do not love modern in the cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do they lack resolution, depth or still something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - As a rule, it is on the present generation that we rely in our work on the gratitude 3D. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Obtaining 8 megapixels with a speed about from 1000 c/s would be evidently well. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but well the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In relation to this last point, all the present technologies are good enough, that adds work to the designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> The resolution must be kept to the mind according to the axes X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed imports also a lot, numbers it from frames at the second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The human movements are dynamic enough, and the 30 c/s do really not suffice, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory of Redmond has given to the to affect sensors a regular delay of treatment included between 1 and 100 µs, the present sensors being more close to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Everybody does not understand at what point that influences the interaction of the man and of the machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would have well need of a device of this type in my work, but not requiring to touch, to have more frames at the second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - But must the number of cameras not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - The Kinect possesses today three &quot;cameras&quot;, one is in fact one infrared transmitter of which and the second, a receiver of the well-considered signal, of which. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is a usual sensor of the visible field in fact. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to define the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Many cameras could solve this problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worsening it increasing the required volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting of creating a supple product similar to the Kinect, of playing with the curve of the cameras and of seeing how that could help to define the places. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> You do not think only of a viewpoint of the daily use of the technologies of the increased reality, the glasses are one of the platforms presenting the most perspectives? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, to be passed all the time with a smartphone the raised hands is not not practice but these are is you are what I think: the best option would be a &quot;transitory&quot; increased reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal device and it is what makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let&apos;s imagine an instant that the handling of the virtual holographic objects in the air is more accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem that the opponents to this idea point the finger at: there is not tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What replies does your group prepare in relation to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lessons, I say often that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between the man and the machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of the tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the time being, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as support of picture. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It records the pressures perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are really destined to attribute palpabilité to these &quot;pictures in the air&quot;: for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a precise point that the finger is and that gives you the sensation, for the time being still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also the bracelets carried on the wrists that influence on the endings nervous about the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - And you have tried to deceive the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make to him to believe that it feels it that in a normal way it should feel at the moment where he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is you are are a good idea, yet we have not tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task underneath on which it will be needed still long to make an effort: the way of making to believe to somebody that feels physically in a space very reduced that it walks in a space opened nearly infinity - us let&apos;s work on the concepts carpets of race (nothing to see with those that one finds in the clubs of fitness), of the mobile platforms and also of the gigantic balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the time being, one manages only averagely to deceive the brain, it remains still numerous years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> This is you are are what gives back the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still absolute of insemination at the state. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of the taste and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; pursues the project &quot;The pétersbourgeoise avant-garde&quot; dedicated to the city-dwellers that feel early, to the avant-garde of the culture and of the art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This ultra-selective list has already received eminent actors of the artistic scene of Saint Petersburg whose works go beyond the border from the city and that have taken on a gratitude in Europe, after having been known in the whole Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the extrovert painter Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all of dressed red that one can cross Russian close to the Museum, of the Garden of summer or still in the parties and previews plugged in. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The pictures of Kirill Miller gather always the crowds, whatever is their place of exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of the foncièrement social and philosophical pétersbourgeois storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the pétersbourgeoise avant-garde of the end of the years 1980 and of the beginning of the years 1990. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance makes to smile the inhabitants and takes them of good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He has lately taken an organ of Barbarie in his hands and it has become the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg since it had matured enough for this difficult role throughout his existence, his philosophy and his picture of gypsy. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why you go over the city everything in red and not in yellow or in turquoise blue for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I have chosen the red as fashion designer specialized in the aspect and embellish it with images. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of picture and the society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Even if in the society, all what is not gray arouses the aggressiveness and a negative agitation. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are destined to start the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation at the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when have you understood that you had to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - To the exhibition of the Palace of the culture Nevskiy that my works were. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I have understood that it was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of the old not official painters was past and the new, free ones, in my kind, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I have started striking up a friendship with the painters of the nouvelle vague, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that has given birth to &quot;Pouchinskaya-10&quot; and then no more there has been wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in the theater, in fashion, to the music, to all the kinds reserving the right the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all that has met itself in your artistic Clinic... - It was important for me of finding myself of the culture of Saint Petersburg where must meet to the center the best creative strengths. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I have taken taken place to Pouchkinskaya-10 that sheltered before the works a musical and artistic club, a gypsy club, the house of the pétersbourgeoise bohemian. </seg>
<seg id="871"> A lot have been born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I see still Chnour happen with the project &quot;The ear of Van Gogh&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in play-back in tight singlets, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group has started happening in LIV, it has become &quot;Leningrad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg did not liven up badly of emissions before the time of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We have given Trakhtenberg to them and it is even though his great career has begun, but his training and his education of base, it is at our places that it has received them. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Galérie &quot;D137&quot;, Club &quot;Griboïedov&quot;: they are repercussions of the artistic Clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees have left there in so much that accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the century spent, of the time that the culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a survey has been organized in the press: it was the price &quot;The personalities of our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> I have been appointed &quot;Painter of the year&quot;, and it is even though my reign has taken thin. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Working in a new time with old rules is not comfortable, I am a representative of the truth, of the honesty and of the culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - A recognizable style characterizes your works. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my pictures are hits, they possess a topicality and a very strong acuteness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am going to have an exhibition programmed &quot;The Russian museum through the clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was social somebody, today that hurts and being thus frightens. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragedy falls. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I like the grotesque, I have ludicrous ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea to save the world via the total and compulsory disguise. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the clothes that are important, one is interested in the mechanism exterior, but not inside the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Maybe that one can not give the hand to him, but that it is needed rather to spit it to the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be erased by the disguise. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Lately we have seen you in the role of the player of organ of Barbarie. - A cultural city must have this type of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> That of other than me can play it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - But maybe that the commercial art also can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Today the commercial art must be looked after, delicate, liquoreux. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of the culture is happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, the people were shared in herds, the partisans of the bohemian liked a thing, the idiots one other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, pleasing everybody is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket of a hundred dollars to please everybody. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, it must be thought whose you are going to please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Every celebrity has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - But several thousand people comes to see Stas Mikhaïlov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - They are people that one has thrown who come to see it, it is the sexual and social side that works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 milles will not come and all things considered they are less management, of money, everything wastes away. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main one it is of not deceiving them, of not wasting the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I painted pictures that a collector has caught beside Falk or of Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I have begun with the pictures that in a usual way are those that one paints in end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, one often mixes up the ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> One says: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The consumption does not have culture, that does not have anything to see. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I have magnified with the example painters who lived in the poverty and died in the poverty and that refused the money precisely for the painting. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am for this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what misses in Saint Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is this concept: the official of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But everyone can not work in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts must be kept. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are today good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in Saint Petersburg that could be expert, but they are discarded, because higher experts that will evaluate correctly are needed these experts and will clear a path to them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Presently, it is the &quot;reign of the taste&quot; that blooms. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they are deferred in this sense that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, which there are painters who must find themselves of other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - For you, what it is Saint Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is more culture, in Moscow well there is a ground for that. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, the art has harm to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than from readers, it is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, it is much of curious that are going to see exhibitions, of the concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> At our places, this coat is very thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make the art in fashion as it was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Project realized with the support of the grant of Saint Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in the space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Climatic reheating or collision with a murderous asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings aboard leave in search of a planet from help. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save the humanity, a great question lands: how to continue make to live our species in weightlessness or still on a planet of help? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that him not there not a lot the choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are two true planets actually that one can conquer, it would not be that by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It is a matter of Venus and of Mars&quot;, values Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the astronomical Institute of State p. K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If on Mars the conditions are adapted more for the life, the temperature to the surface of Venus is of 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> One can not live there only at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in the space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> One has started being interested in the questions of the reproduction in the space focusing on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There is still a demi-siècle, one carried out experiences on the plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of small peas cultivated on orbit did not differ in any way from the landed varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Afterwards, one has put insects, of the small reproductive drosophila flies, on orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, eggs of quail have been sent in the space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> One obtains a totally normal chick at the exit. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is afterwards that the problems begin. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is related by the way that the chick must take on a support, he must put itself on his legs and to start moving&quot;, explains the manager of the laboratory of the Institute of the médico-biologiques problems of the Academy of the sciences of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding any support, the chicks fidgeted in a disordered way. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And at the end of 10 hours, the new ones born saw their instincts entirely atrophy. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks did not react either to the light or to the sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they would die quite simply at the end of quattre days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We have opened them wide the eyes two times, then we have abandoned, because it is quite simply impossible to work with them over there,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev noticing the failure of the experience with the chicks in the space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last biological &quot;miniature arch&quot; with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiences will continue at the spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> Though, the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; will embark only species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experience with rats sent with their foetus in the space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> As a rule, one has not discovered anything of supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was a matter still of the biosatellites and then it is the only experience. It must be carried out kind of investigations, made notice Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the rats of the space have given birth to their progeny. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Nevertheless, one does not manage yet to carry out reproductions directly in the space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> It is not a thin business. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Losing their usual environment, the animals are not in measure of realizing their sexual instinct anymore. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Contrary to the animals, the man is capable, as a rule. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homosexual sapiens possesses the abstract thought, it is capable to create a suitable emotional bottom. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This type of experience is not realized for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the women go to the space for already 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk has been taken by Terechkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the feminine organism is what the humanity has of more precious. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull has flown away and nobody on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight in the space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she would have been able to give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Nobody replied to this question&quot;, explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, pensioner of the sector of the rockets and of the space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after his flight in the space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a small girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaïev was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been two times on orbit and having even worked in extra-véhiculaire environment, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Though, the risk lasts. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have little, even very few cosmonauts that anything have not had and that give birth to a lineage in full health after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if they are longer, that presents a danger even during the flights in orbit&quot;, concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Nevertheless, the humanity must look for new solutions in the biotechnologies, the protection against the radiations and the creation of an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of the Center of preparation of the cosmonauts: compulsory stage from the preparation to the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in buoyancy none, the cosmonauts take themselves to the extra-véhiculaires exits. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water imitates the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> So for the adults, the water is comfortable but though a foreign environment, for the infants, it is their real element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibious men seem to confirm it: the life on Earth comes from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> In so far as the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of the stomach of his mother, it is it more easy of getting used afterwards to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is as a rule logical, because from his birth to his first bath, he passes only 2 weeks to itself. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is very little to forget&quot;, explains the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, of a strength of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles of the stomach, of the pool atrophy very rapidly, the capacity of pressure of the baby vanishes. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Good agreed, let&apos;s ignore that leaning on the simulators of delivery. </seg>
<seg id="992"> One can of course prepare a delivery in a special bedroom, the woman will manage to make it go out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And afterwards&quot;? ask for Valeriy Poliakov to induce to think about this complex question. </seg>
<seg id="994"> From another side, the child also needs an artificial gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If it does not feel the land attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> One can not dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for the trainings. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will be everything simply deprived of his vital needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experience that we would envisage in that case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return on Earth of a handicapped child, entirely disadapted,&quot; foresees the Manager of the committee for the bioethics of the Institute of the médico-biologiques problems of the Academy of the sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of the children in the space raises still theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Though, with the time that will become reality, while the Earthlings will go to their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their lineage born in the space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The leader of the ISC (Superior institution of control of the public finances) has declared: &quot;The control of the independent pseudo work (in Czech&quot; system &quot;Švarc&quot;) has failed because of the politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the domain of the public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a legislation of quality but it lags behind with regard to his application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> It is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the superior Institution of control of the public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz, has declared. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will not be ever perfect, but his application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking at our places&quot;, has declared Kala in his comment of the present situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A control led jointly by Czech and German inspectors suggests also similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He quotes as example of excessive practice approaches it to the &quot;system Švarc&quot; by Petr Nečas. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Mister the Prime Minister has lately declared that the ODS was not going to bother the contractors with controls; is it therefore allowed or is forbidden? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law well must be applied somehow, then if it forbids something, even the leader of the government can not prevent from acting an authority responsible to go to inspect of requiring the respect of the law&quot;, notices Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> During the meeting of the commission of control in Parliament, you have evoked a tchéco-allemand project within the framework of which the legislations have been compared as regards public markets of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> Of what it was question concretely? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a matter of a parallel control that we have thrown it is of that about two years. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, the European legislation foresees in what way to manage the public markets and particular national legislations as a properly said practice make him continuation. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have gathered all that and although this procedure of control is not yet finished, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally talking, our legislation is maybe &quot;more severe and better quality&quot;, nevertheless, according to some parameters, practises it than such a is better at Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms therefore that it does not suffice to elaborate continuously more and more detailed rules but that devoting oneself to the bet in application even of the right is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> In what this project can help you concretely and that it results from it for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A common control of this type would owe precisely to contribute to what we stopped endeavoring to clarify the laws, to lower and to improve the thresholds, while that does not have an effect really positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means to obtain the thing in question at a reasonable price (what does not want always to say the lowest), in order to exclude every enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But lowering the thresholds of the markets, one will not reach this objective inevitably. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It would be able itself that this system finds itself to such a point submerged by the paperwork, that those that look for the faults will find a lot more opportunities than so the threshold had remained more top. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems regarding the application of the legislation of the public markets. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system of control in Germany work? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an institution analogous to our different ISC or fashion of organization? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> With regard to the institutions, in the same way to the ISC, works over there the Bundesrechnungshof that is organized similarly, it has also an advice constituted a bit differently, but these two institutions proceed fundamentally from analogous way. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The abilities are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a shade though in relation to our system: as Germany is a federal structure, it has therefore also Government Accounting Offices of this type as regards the different Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH uniquely can control the federal money, what corresponds at our places to the resources of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The public funds managed at our places by the regions and the municipalities, are over there controlled at the level of the Government Accounting Offices of the Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> In what concerns the national legislation, is it simpler than ours does? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I would not want to make of general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in some domains, Germany often is referred to as a model but one can not say surely that it makes better in all the domains. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It is can be owed by the way that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Not, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data of comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it must also be said about problems that this country that we consider as a model is also confronted with a whole series. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise they would not have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> In what concerns the national legislation, that has meant for you, as institution, the amendment of the law on the public markets, his effects make to themselves already to feel? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> As this amendment has come into force relatively lately, it does not have still impact on our operations of control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we make controls a posteriori, one must reckon with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our observations concern uniquely, for the time being, the process of preparation of the future controls - us have thrown a new instrument of &quot;detection of the risks of bad management&quot; with which we have passed to the screen close to 14 000 public markets - there these changes will make to themselves of course to feel, because the thresholds have been modified as the conditions of some types of procedures of calls of offers and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Therefore do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an increase of load for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law constitutes a step in the good direction and I hope that the future will confirm it. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can occur is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to respect them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the system of the previous rules, the recipient (for example the regional advice, in the case of the regional operational programs) forced the subjects controlled to accept that every violation of the law on the markets means a breach to the budget discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is making the law more severe in this way therefore really useful? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Not in this way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those that want to attack the system or to deceive some but not to punish those that commit formal mistakes without consequence on the decision process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system is going to put of advantage of pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> What is therefore the solution to put through? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let&apos;s look to where we do not go. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Lately, the Prime Minister has declared that the ODS was not going to bother the contractors with controls of the so-called system Švarc - how much that means? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> Is the system Švarc prohibited or is authorized? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law well must be applied somehow, then if it forbids something, even the leader of the government can not prevent from acting an authority responsible to go to inspect and to require the respect of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It can declare: &quot;We are going to change the law and to allow to him&quot;, but he can not say that we are going to act so that is all right was not. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets comprises relatively strict rules on the formalities to fulfill and it, precisely in order to protect the call from offers. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is besides tragic that a tenderer is eliminated uniquely for cause of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but his application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking at our places. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are by places cold, but the majority remain practicable. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> At some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also covered with snow. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The network remains though in major practicable part, at some places with an increased vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Region of Karlovy Vary </seg>
<seg id="1058"> In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were this morning practicable, but by places frozen and also covered with snow. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 centigrade ones but they should lightly go back to the day. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The falls of snow have stopped in the region and it remains only a thin coat of snow in the plains. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The crests of the metalliferous Mounts (Krusné hory) are however covered with about 30 centimeters of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It emerges from the data of the regional service of maintenance of the roads that because of the fog, the visibility was reduced through places. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The expressway R6 and the state highways of the region are henceforth practicable without difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> The vigilance remains though to bet, for example on some bridges of which the coating can be frozen and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> All the regional roads and see them of third category, including the roads of mountain, are also practicable. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> It remains still on some of their sections of the rests of snow cold and through places packed by the traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Especially in the zones situated in altitude, the drivers must reinforce their vigilance. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Regions of Pardubice and of Hradec Králové </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The Direction of the roads and motorways notifies on his Web site that some roads of Bohemian of the East are threatened by the training of black ice and that coats of snow packed by the traffic can be on the roads in the zones mountainous and situated in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The services of maintenance of the roads warn the drivers against the risks of training of black ice in the zones of the region of Pardubice situated in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> There can be black ice in the surroundings of Lanskroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and it, principally on the roads regional and of third category. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> The roads I/43 and I/34 to the surroundings of Svitavy have been treated chemically. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> The snow is principally in the Mounts of the Giants (Krkonose) and the Mounts of the Eagle (Orlické hory). </seg>
<seg id="1074"> In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and of Trutnov, a coat of snow packed by the traffic is present on the roads in the zones situated in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> In Bohemian of the East, the time will be today dry, the most often freed, with possible cloudy passages. </seg>

<seg id="1077"> Region of Pilsen </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The roads of the region of Pilsen are today practicable, although, by places, it suits of showing a vigilance increased and of adapting his behavior to the conditions meteorological. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It freezes this morning, the temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 centigrade ones. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> After the last falls of snow and the cooling that has followed, some transport links can be by places cold. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> The drivers can expect to cross zones of fog, the visibility will improve however progressively. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> It is what it emerges from the information of the regional service of maintenance of the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The motorway D5 is practicable nearly without difficulties, the services of maintenance of the road communications recommends though a vigilance increased between the kilometers 80 and 131. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The coating of most of the state highways is dry and cold. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The ways regional and of third category are moist and in that case applies the warning against the cold sections. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> The drivers must be vigilant, and that particularly on the roads less frequented of the region of the Šumava. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Region of Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="1089"> The drivers going to the zones of the region of Olomouc situated in altitude must today reckon with a thick and soft coat of snow on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> This coat has remained on the collar said &quot;Červenohorské sedlo&quot; and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the operations of chemical treatment. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The falls of snow have forced tonight the staff of maintenance of the roads to go on the ground; according to the services in load of the road, it has fallen more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> In the other parts of the region, most of the streets are practicable without difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> On the heights of the district of Šumperk find itself of the rests of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> The drivers circulating towards Jeseník must expect to meet to the collar said &quot;Červenohorské sedlo&quot; a coat of thick and soft snow&quot; has declared today to ČTK the leader of the services of maintenance roads of the district of Šumperk. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Their colleagues of the district of Jeseník have also surrendered on site for the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads, now are freed and are wetted, even in the highest zones. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> In the district of Olomouc the roads are practicable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk the drivers however should mind in the sections in forest zones to the streets remained moist. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Regions of Ústí nad Labem and of Liberec </seg>
<seg id="1098"> From this morning, the services of maintenance of the roads of Bohemian of the North have signaled several difficult sections. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> It emerges from the data of the police, which on top of some places covered with snow or with black ice, the road of mountain going from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The temperatures will remain below zero besides low altitude, and therefore the snow and the black ice should persist on the roads. In the plains, notably southwards is of the central Tray of Bohemian, there is not any problem, on the contrary, and the roads are generally dry. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> No difficulty of circulation has been signaled for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> The services of maintenance of the roads have signaled the presence of black ice, notably at the surroundings of Štětí. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal to his training: rain and melting of snow during the day, clear sky and frost for the night. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> One signals also, from the main axes of circulation, difficult conditions on the state highway 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and of Liberec. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The closing of the circulation between Telnice and Knínice is owed at branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow up to reaching the street. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest has declared: &quot;In concert, we want to collect positive energy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1107"> That you think of the fact that in less than one month it should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one of this alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love to fall. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, one rather laughs at it and one tells to itself than we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to reject or of preventing the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Furthermore, you go up in December a totally unique project: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you present more in detail this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charitable action that we prepare for already two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We have decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21st at 11 hours 10 of the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on December 20th, three concerts will take place simultaneously, at Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end virtually at the moment where will take end the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati that is found pacific in the ocean, on an hourly spindle early of 12 hours in relation to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who has had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> To the departure I think that it was my idea, afterwards we have conceived everything with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Outside the fact that we want to collect sufficiently of positive energy to save the world, we want as together, with the public, to think about the state of the world as we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the Occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique objects, notably of the shoes, T-shirts, bags, and of the original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz the people can support us also. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters also has recorded a hymn against the end of the world that is called &quot;End of the world canceled&quot; (in Czech&quot; Konec světa zruseno &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, one will hear it also during these charitable concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, very in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The hymns will join also at a moment given within the framework of an emission in direct, totally unique, from the Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The words of this song have been written by Tomás Hanák that has also the main role from Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings also... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How you are of it come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, because of the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We endeavor to make them participate intensively in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has proved that most of them are interested by such a cooperation and that that amuses them. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What will the profits of these concerts against the end of the world be used to? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the training center Studeo that is accessible to the people to reduced mobility and of which we work on the realization within the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and that for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers go regularly next to the students of the institute Jedličkův and propose them activities that interest them and amuse them. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means of going to lessons, we try to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Within the framework of the completion of the building of the institute Jedlička, we will transfer this project in a new independent building trade. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Will several groups of music and interpreters go up on stage from these concerts during each? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria, you have the selected ones? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to elaborate a program that appeals to all the generations, including the children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, will go up on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> You prepare also for others &quot; mega events&quot; of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time within the framework of the spring of Prague; there as, we will prepare surely a program of quality with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would love to play also the next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, a time on site in the United States, I would love to combine well concerts to Washington and to Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example at Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> Nevertheless The Tap Tap is a group composed of handicapped people. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and the logistics of your rounds? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as terrible that that seems to the first surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in electric armchair whose machines must travel in hold, naturally we drag around also many luggages and boxes of instruments.... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far everything is itself more or less always well past, ČSA and British Airways always perfectly were prepared for us, they have surprised me more than one time. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, from where we have come back lately, everything has happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your journeys abroad, you can compare in which these countries differ with regard to the easiness from access for the people to reduced mobility, of the attitude of the public opinion encounter of the people handicapped and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What have been your experiences until now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and of other places where everything works better than at our places, we have precisely summer witnesses in Moscow that eastwards everyone is not although in an initial stage. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to the handicapped people; over there, it is not still a current that a person moves alone in electric armchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not consider as an obviousness of giving a person the priority in armchair in an elevator yet. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, over there as, an association endeavoring to attract the attention on the problems of the handicapped people is at being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> In what must we still catch the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things for which we are still late... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and improvements depend always on the efforts deployed by the concerned people. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> At London and Madrid, it is totally ordinary that the people with a heavy handicap move alone in the public spaces; they can go to the bathroom, at the museum, anyplace... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is not nevertheless very frequent over there that a great number of handicapped people participate actively in the social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary to the point progress! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public and the easiness of access are a thing, but the situation will really start changing while we will have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the time being, they are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is presently very popular, let&apos;s return backward of some years, how much has driven you in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I have started working as teacher at the institute Jedlička, where I have found myself surrounded with many youths ready to be given oneself into something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am myself musician (I play, among others, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, with the time, as says our moderator Láďa Angelovič, one has lost the control of the situation (laughs) a bit. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success has happened only in the course of these last years, if I do not make a mistake? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, the fact of creating connections to well known singers and of working actively on the promotion of the group has helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist at heart. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the grants of the European Union, we can, besides, allow ourselves to have teachers of quality, of the equipment, and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Did you have as objective to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I have felt that there was a potential to change the things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The business show is full of things that are copied ones the others. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In some way, it is logical: all what is new is accepted with caution and that long lasts. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Rare are the original projects, and I dare to maintain that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally the pity, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is totally useless, because the people with a handicap are not unwell beings, abandoned of everyone, which we must take in pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who can live a life fully and blossom itself, to condition of having the necessary means of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say often that while people with a handicap manage to realize something, it is not only an overhang for them but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Your success also is not owed by the way that you are a leader requiring, as you are qualified by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do work of quality, we must be intransigent in many domains and require some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think that it is totally normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive to our places with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to the repetitions two times a week, to follow the preliminary lessons and to pass much of time on the roads for the concerts, they lose rapidly their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But that works in the same way in every group that wants to work and to reach objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap counts twenty members presently. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one, Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group, the people go and leave, one can not nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those that want or would have desire of joining. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> That will be the case the day before of the day foreseen of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 2012 from 21 hours 20th. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, at Brno at Fléda and at Ostrava at the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and of other musicians of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> In end of evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual intermediary while will be sung jointly the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world canceled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The goal of the concert is of rallying average financiers (to height of 25 million CZK) to equip the training center multifunction Studeo that is in Prague in the institute Jedlička. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The prize of a ticket for this concert is of 400 CZK, the entry is free for the children until 12 years, the presale of the tickets is open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, during the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European spatial Agency, Poland has been admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the old block of the East (the Czech Republic has become member fully on November 12th, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had started a narrow collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in the course of the years that have followed has participated in a number of projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road of Poland to the space has begun though much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Already before the second world war, passionate Polish worked on spatial flights; they did always not meet understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would want to evoke for example the conference of A. Šternfeld to the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, on December 6th, 1933, in the course of which he presented ideas gotten out of his work of avant-garde titled &quot;Introduction to the astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and of the years later Šternfeld remembered than only the doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his works. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his work &quot;Introduction to the astronautics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The aforementioned doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became thereafter a great spread of the astronomy and of the astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> It published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote numerous works devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski has become a spread of the astronautics of world fame, his contribution has notably been rewarded with the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> From 1925 was built in Poland an intended gang car to be equipped with a rocket motor. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> One does not know unfortunately either the author or the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear either if the rocket had to be used to propel or to slow down the gang car. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known on this gang car are those of the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From 1933, the Polish artillery started devoting itself to the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The investigations were led by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the teachers Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> It emerges from the preserved documents that this research had reached the stadium of the testings. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the investigations have interrupted themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, the plans of a rocket of photoelectric hunting, outlined by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and next year was published the work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects had a military use of the motors of rockets as purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all the projects of use of the technique of the rockets were led by the provisional consultative scientific committee (&quot;Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy&quot;), which coordinated all the works. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of working, the beginning of the war put an end to his activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other works devoted to the aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautic society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is question of a society in the number of November 1954 of the Problem newspaper, in which four more detailed articles devoted to the aeronautics are. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by the teacher Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed of creating a society devoted to the astronautics </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At this time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was light that the domain of the spatial research had of the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautic society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter to the international astronautic federation (created in 1951) and from the autumn, the PTA became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> Next year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the international astronautic federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> It preserved his duty up to his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the crowned development of success of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific investigations. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was finished in 1957 and the first launching took place on October 10th, 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> This rocket of a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a bit less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Thereafter was built an improved version, RM-1A and, for the summer 1959, of the testings of flight of the rocket to two stories RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket had a length of 1.4 meter and probably weighed 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next prototype should have been capable of carrying out concrete scientific works - the rocket RM-34 should have had a range going up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all the works of development were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The rocket Meteor-1 designed in the course of the period 1962 - 1965, followed the first rockets of type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, conceived with two stories, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A -1 B and -1 C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved to the scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket Meteor-1A had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B this volume was of 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liter. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximal range of all these types of machine was of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965 - 1968, the rockets Meteor-2 were designed in the aeronautical institute, the first testings of flight began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of transporting a load useful of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Thereafter were built the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It suits still to mention the entry of Poland the COSPAR (Committee heart Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years more late. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Within the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in the spatial exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The abrogation of the law on the works of public usefulness is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional Court has repealed the law on the works of public usefulness. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has lifted up a lively discussion in the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is undoubtedly interesting of examining these problems of a broader viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems directed to the liberalism, in the EU as well as in the context of the globalization, are based on the principle of more of not regulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> This means concretely that the different economic entities as the national economic systems are perpetually ones in conflict with the others. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This results from the principle of the freedom of the business and of the free circulation (beyond measure) of the capital deprived ally to a frantic financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The sizeable differences of the price of the work (salaries) generate a tension on the prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> He admits to putting the next meaning under this term: a producer endeavors by the importation of goods sold down busy of resisting the economic competition &quot;making more expensive&quot; the price of the competitor, with the aim of taking off a greater part of the market and of increasing thus his own benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most of the contractors: or to transfer the production abroad, or to buy down price, is to disappear. The result is an important unemployment in the countries that the prices of the work are put up in comparison to other economics. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital does not have any responsibility of the viewpoint social and by là même of responsibility face to face of the unemployment that it generates, the social loads of the State increase necessarily. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of misters the contractors to pay taxes and to compensate thus for the economic and social damages caused to the unity of the society by this race to the benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is at such a point of public reputation that supplying concrete statistics with the data is not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The practices without scruples of the private capital generate in the different economics a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to launch into a mutual competition in order to lower artificially the social status of their own population with the aim of attracting the foreign capital at their places. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments put their own population at the mercy of the capital deprived without taking into account the social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This principally appears in the amendments of the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The objective is of forcing economically his own population to accept the diktat of the prices of the capital deprived, notably in the domain of the salaries. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> On the one hand this happens by a system of economic pressures in the event of unemployment in the long term and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of the wage earners in the domain of the legislation of the work. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> It results from it an increasing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the wealthy persons and the poor ones. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In RFA, it exists for years of the points of public distribution of food for the poor that can not provide to their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> One counts already the number of these people by millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Within the framework of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economics, it becomes totally ordinary that the wage earners receive such salaries that the State sees itself be forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the minimum vital. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal has for example been updated in the case of the wage earners working as assistants at the federal parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The measures of economics of virtually all the Member States of the south of the EU generate, undoubtedly, a situation analog in which, under the pressure of a collapse catastrophic of the society, the people are constrained or of emigrating (as it the case was at the 19th century), or of rubbing along with salaries of misery, in margin of the society, in the hope that a day the private capital invests in their country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is needed to ask here the next question to itself: from where will this capital come? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other countries of the EU, then the poverty will pass from a country at another; this capital can not not come either, or then one Chinese, an Indian, one Brazilian, a Turk, one Moroccan, an Egyptian or African continu of working for a fraction of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also concerns the whole Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media maintain that the State can not make investments in capitals in his own economics, which the led economics drives to an economic disaster, to be tired by it. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital defends pungently the idea that the State can not intervene in the economics by regulating interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> It is needed to wonder then if the private capital does not influence and, even, does not lead today the one political and by the same one, the very whole State, according to his own selfish interests. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The reply to this question is undoubtedly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is a virtually omnipotent and present lobby in all the States. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> It a desperate situation being shown in the domain of the corruption, by the concession of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable, results from it. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In RFA, the situation is such, that because of the lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate the elaboration of the projects of laws at office of lawyers narrowly related to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are adopted afterwards in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The whole of the power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of western type, but of powerful financial groups serving their own interests declare it. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the democracies directed to the liberalism see themselves now be rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work titled &quot;the crisis of the empire roman in times of Caesar and of Pumped&quot;: &quot;The State was for long in full deliquescence and the duties were attributed by the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of containers-of-wine, the favors obtained illegally, both the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these posts. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The dessous-de-table and the corruption proliferated beyond measure and the people surrendered to the elections with already sold voices&quot;... ... &quot;The honest people did not look for themselves in no way to obtain duties, it resulted from it once the State remained 8 months without consuls&quot;.... &apos;One really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that an energetic man must be chosen&apos;... It is true that Appianos had to the mind Pumped, but he is Caesar that has transformed irreversibly the democracy into absolutistic system. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in the antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of the personal benefit, without considerations for the interest of the society in his unity. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In his gasoline, the private capital is not no more capable of understanding and of bringing out the interests of the society in his unity. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> It results from it, today as in the past, a decadence without preceding elites, without no effort to carry out reforms in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist systems in the liberalization without scruples of the economic systems of the XIX and XX centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the present state of the things, one can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of the democracies of liberal type as a kind of break before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the present elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises whose witnesses we are today as the crimes against the humanity such than we know them throughout the old and recent history. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The abrogation of the law on the works of public usefulness is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of the economic competition, to the international plan as well as at the European internal level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue search for means by reducing the social status of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This tendency is indeed systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution consists in reforms to sociopolitical aims, which will reinforce the investments in capitals of the State in the economics, will increase the influence of the citizens on the government and will weaken the position of monopoly of the capital deprived in the society for the benefit of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of the chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Nothing will go out ever of the violence and never will not &quot;be able&quot; declares Sting in the Fragile titled song of which the main line of the chorus is&quot;not forget not how much we are fragile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons did not want wars, some would not be&quot;, he asserted Gutele Schnaper, the woman of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> With reference to the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, numerous reactions have risen. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some take the party of Israel, resorting of his right to the self-defense and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the committed genocide against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to think about the question of knowing that is guilty and that is a victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, have been born in the present political situation and have not lived the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would want to offer the readers a viewpoint situated &quot;behind the curtain&quot;, on that to whom take advantage principally of the tensions that last already for more than 95 years (as from the declaration Balfour in 1917) in a small end of country of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these thoughts base on available historical facts to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of the modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of the humanity is above all the history of a fight for the power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> At every time, we can find an Alexandre the Great one or a Napoléon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> It who is not so evident is knowledge if this individuality acted in an independent way or if they owed their acts to the throne to somebody that led their acts according to preliminarily definite objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live at a time where the world wealth is concentrated between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration generating some powers has not been able to make generation to itself only in the course of one. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the possessing families an astronomical wealth distinguishes particularly the family Rothschild, who could be considered as the head of the octopus (I ignore if these families have still a leader but I do not exclude it). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little their subject is written. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> From the years 90 of the 19th century, they have acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) in order to put a term at the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts that they were mixed with and that had always meant a reinforcement of their power, an increase of their fortune or the two of them, for them. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They possess major participations nearly in most of the central banks of the world and prepare or lead wars against the countries in which they do not have yet of the such participations (before the invasion of the Afghanistan the number of these countries were of 7, after the invasion of the Iraq of 5, after the inversion of Kadhafi only of 4, meanwhile Russia has put the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Every person who has tried to rise up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew America des Rothschild to the Bank of the statute of central bank and started to emit during the civil war his own money (governmental, I hear well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> JFK started emitting own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he has been murdered in 1963, the deputy Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 even though he wanted to start proceedings against the FED to have started the great economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst of being able at the world level has driven in the years 1859 to 1871 to the expression of a plan of three world wars through Albert Pike, a freemason initiated into the 33rd degree, being the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war had as objective to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second had to remove the colonialism, notably British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion of individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create only one universal religion (the ecumenism not being anything else than begins it of such a solution) and, to the final one, to acquire a power absolute. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of the richest families with to their head the Rothschild consists to create a crisis to propose a solution then afterwards (order ab chaos - l&apos; order in accordance with the chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are fake and drive always of the situation to a worsening (to see the creation of the FED destined to avoid not repeating of the crises as those that they provoked in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After having succeeded in starting the first world war by the murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the austro-hongrois throne, they destroyed the tsarist Russia causing the Bolshevist revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war did not end brusquely with an economic and military German capitulation without justifications (the war was not no more necessary for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the division of the Austria-Hungary, the power of central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> For an easier release of the second world war, the bankers have let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they have imposed to Germany fantastic repairings of generating war thus the conditions of a radicalization of the masses impoverished (it afterwards suffices to them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing of the finger culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including of a strong German minority that had to play the role (that it held indeed) of fifth column to set fire to the powders and to start a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, of which one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish State, of preference in the region of the historical Judée with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The declaration of Balfour mentioned above put the bases of a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arabic local population began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were committed of part and of other. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war burst; appreciating if Hitler has broken the chains in which the international bankers had kept it initially is difficult; or if all what it has made was planned, the fact is however that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel officially was based in 1948; in the same way that the repairings of war imposed to Germany were originally second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel has lit a home of fire being able to cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was it in the course of the second world war, the first victim of the fightings, this time as the Arabic or generally Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is as an immense laboratory, the source of discord and of chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it suffices to see how the people divide pungently between partisans and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> That is guilty and that is a victim in the israélo-palestinien conflict, where a fault generates another fault according to a circle of unending violence and where one finds, at the origin of everything, the cupidity of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world integer? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders must be made, because as at our places, the international bankers propose only their own candidates to the people to the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The present Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascistic politician, loyal encounter of the international bankers, who makes everything in order to start a war with the Iran, which would be able, because of the adhesion of this country to the organization of cooperation of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) spreading to become a world conflict and, given that Iran controls the strait of Ormuz by which 20% of all the world oil passes (this naval corridor does not have a width that of 2 miles) and to generate a destruction of the world economics. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under what light appear now the intentions kept by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;The only thing that we need is a general crisis and the people will accept a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and of slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of the finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> One world in which very new born is seen itself to introduce at birth a making silicon chip of it one totally to be controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;That they force all the individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry a brand to the red-hot iron on the hand or the forehead, so that it can not neither to buy nor to sell the one that does not carry the name of this ferocious animal or the number of his name. </seg>

<seg id="1334"> This number refers to the man and they are six hundred and sixty six.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: while everything goes to the more badly, to call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, crowds of demonstrators composed of Islamist students assaulted the American embassy of Tehran and kept in diplomatic hostages 52. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They had to be freed in return for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, that, after the revolution, had escaped in the United States, which supported his system for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer positive solution to the American administration, it could, indeed, not abandon the Shah, because it would seriously have undermined the trust of his allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Though, in Iran, where the revolution had led on to the establishment of a theocratic system, she was not in a position to obtaining the release from the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, blow still aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt of release of the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The sequestered diplomats were finally freed 444 days later, with reference to the negotiations organized by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The Iranian collapse contributed strongly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter opposite Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, of the actor and director Ben Affleck, described an episode of this history that offered a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before it is not occupied, six employees escaped of the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After complicated incidents, they found themselves in the residence of the ambassador of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to make them go out of Iran thanks to a fantastic blanket: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team of filming come to make locations for the filming of a film to great show of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Combination of the kinds </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In order to make the legend more credible, of the go shopping specialized made state of this project of film, conferences of presses were organized and a society of imaginary production had real offices. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation remained long secret, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The film of Affleck is an unusual combination of several kinds. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is on the one hand a matter of a political thriller conceived in a realistic way but also a &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of a successful blow, of a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean&apos;s eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The atmospheres succeed: of the sequences of Tehran of documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented of the iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way these same situations of which, thanks to these photos, have been retranscribed in the film, there are not great differences), </seg>
<seg id="1355"> of the slighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration, </seg>
<seg id="1356"> and then scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and of other institutions with discussing men of the situation around tables of conference dressed up, in the corridors and on the telephone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck has succeeded in taking off again his career in a remarkable way. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Of ridiculed actor, he has become a respected director and his game of actor has stopped arousing ironic remarks. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third length-length after the dark one policeman &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The town&quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> It is not also the first film of Affleck that does not take place in his city of origin, Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place appoints one of the characteristics that put his first films above the hollywoodiens switchboards. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck makes also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in Argo that the role of Tehran &quot;is kept&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by his light that suggests also the confusion and the unpredictability occurring while suddenly, in a given place, a page of history writes to itself. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his colleagues obtain an analogous effect in the imaginary scenes (team of filming in the bazaar of Tehran distorts it). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many actions at too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director has had to content himself with a subject offering actually only few thrilling scenes, to the cinematographic sense of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He puts through very well, it adds sometimes some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which threatens it with crisis to the airport of Tehran is discarded by a blow of telephone in America and the pursuit on the runway enough are pulled by the hair). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo resides in his dissipated character, owed to the necessity of showing too many events to too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are totally charming in their role of hollywoodiens co-operators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and it is not, far from there, the only ones in that case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film of Affleck misses a little dramatic tension, he lets itself see moderate with an interest, appreciating the realization and the style retro fashions-view mirror of the years 70. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It takes the spectator, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As recall of a history still, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the business. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Of the rules to inflate balls-topped mountains, the bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The waiter www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which leads every year a public inquiry on the most absurd banking charges, has decided, at present, to launch the competition of the regulations or of the ideas in origin of &quot;the EU workroom&quot; the most absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;The fact that the EU plans, these last times, to adopt a quota of 40 pour-cent of women for the direction of the great European firms has been at the origin of our decision&quot;, has declared for the newspaper Právo the organizer of this inquiry, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the mentioned absurdities, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unifying the insurance premiums for the men and the women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now nevertheless, the women were favored with regard to the prices of the assurances on the life because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for the companies of assurance. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The people can signal until at the end of the very other year also incredible idea of &quot;the workroom of the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> &quot;The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013&quot;, has informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the regulations debated of the EU finds itself, for example, the obligation to add components bio to the fuels, what has harmful consequences as the environment, or the ban to use the reliable ones thermometers to mercury, uniquely because they contain a relatively weak quantity of a dangerous substance or still the directive regarding the size of the cages of the hens, what has taken the increase of the price of the eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticisms have also been produced by the past contrary to the de facto ban to use the expression &quot;butter to tartiner&quot; or of the withdrawal of the sale of the classical bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> The bananas of quality must have a size of 14 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European administration reacts often under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (thus the Czech Republic imposes presently the requests for his banks threatening to use his right of veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, the bananas must not be from a size inferior to 14 cm nor present an &quot;abnormal curve&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission has defended arguing that it made only to harmonize not homogeneous national norms that complicated the business. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The norms regarding the fruits and vegetables have been loosened in spite of the opposition of some States, claiming that the existent directives lead to a wasting of food produce. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first price will be can to be awarded in this inquiry to the regulations of the EU of the last year according to which must depict on the inflatable balls-topped mountains a warning indicating that the children of less than 8 years must not inflate adults without surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has referred to an American inquiry according to which the balls-topped mountains are, among the toys, the first cause of death of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to the children of less than 14 years with regard to blowing in trumpets of fair. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> By us also, one has strange ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The next rule regarding the European officials themselves is absurd enough: because of the sensibility of this theme for Greece, every person having a public office within the EU can not use the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; and owes, instead, to talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association &quot;Let Make&quot; gathering liberal economists, the waiter Bankovnípoplatky.com has named in this inquiry, beside some absurdities mentioned above, the regulations of the Union regarding the volume of the reserves of foodstuffs on the territory of Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU had set maximal volumes for the reserves of foodstuffs being able to be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our adhesion to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic overtook afterwards, for example, the volumes set for the mushrooms in preserve and risked, of this fact, a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of this inquiry have considered interesting the idea to pour sums of money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea to grant a grant to ask for the concession of grants. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas do not originate however from Brussels but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;The fact of not having sea handicaps us. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We are going to ask in the European Union for a repayment&quot;. Thus has expressed, at the autumn 2004, the minister of the Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> It accused that, because of our production of wheat, and with reference to the purchases called &quot;interventionist&quot;, the State had met itself with full stocks that he had had to export afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to Palas, the EU should have poured us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> After all, the European Commission replied positively Czech on request and organized a call of offers for the purchase of wheat from the countries without maritime access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The grants for the obtainment of grants have been proposed to the towns by the ministry of the local Development led by the minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), these, concretely, had to be used to write requests of grants granted by Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU declares: &quot;the strange regulations are rare&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations arouse often criticisms in the Member States, according to numerous experts, the efforts deployed by the one HAD as regards regulation and of improvement of the effectivité of the working of the Union as in the domain of his general development, deserve rather praises. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of grants of the EU for projects that do absolutely not have anything to see European integration with the reinforcement, but that have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic owes, as of other countries of the Union, to fight with Brussels for the right to use specific designations for these products traditional (fight of which it does not go out always victorious) arouses lively emotions among the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have defended the designation &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&quot; with success, for what from the appellation &quot;Tuzemský rum&quot; that goes back to us to the 19th century, our producers have had to replace it with the designation &quot;Tuzemák&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the products to base of alcohol of cane sugar, and not to base of beet sugar, can carry the designation of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of the products recorded of the EU, one finds today mondialement known as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the marzipan of Lübeck or of the ham of Parme, the cookies of Karlovy Vary (&quot;Karlovarské suchary&quot;), the carps of Pohořelice and of Třeboň (&quot;Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr&quot;) and the hop of Žatec (&quot;Žatecký chmel&quot;) in company of cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The gingerbread of Pardubice (&quot;Pardubický perník&quot;) and the cakes called &quot;Cones of Hořice&quot; (&quot;hořické trubičky&quot;) also can be proud of their community brand. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> The people want me to save the Republic, but I am only an amateur, breaks out senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mister the Senator, how one has the idea to be appeared to the presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> Being senator or president who counts for me is not. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I do not stand to see as the country is plundered for these twenty last years, that the thieves are not under lock and key and the taxes and the age of the departure to the retirement increase anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I did not have the ambition of becoming political. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that not me plait not, then I try to bring a solution so that that changes. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have more than forty years and that I am independent, member of no party, I do not have other solutions to influence the situation only of appearing to the presidential or senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You have gone to the Senate but you have put rapidly bound for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do you not turn thus the back to those that have elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said about the senatorial elections that I will launch into the battle for the Castle according to the results </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Thereafter, I have clarified that if I was elected senator, I would appear to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the duty, this is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> It is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not only that as nation we moan at the bar bass or in front of our post of television, but it is also that we stamp cough those that try to bring change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Thereto adds the press that breaks the reputation of the people and mixes up freedom of word with freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> One has, for example, maintained to my intention that I bribe the journalists or that I have been the adviser of Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Turn to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You have started the fight for the Castle with as hobbyhorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of the politicians and of the retroactive fiscal declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You owe at this end to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate in his unity can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> While as citizen, I have made pressure so that the activities of touristic guide constitute a liberal profession, I have obtained earnings from cause. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem it is the politicaillerie: while somebody arrives of left or of right with a good project, this is knowingly refused and that delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As independent, member of no party, I have many more chances of obtaining the support from all the parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of power, without partisan categorization and dogma, to take of every party what is of better for our country and to put it in application. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself rather as a man of right or of left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Of a Czech viewpoint, I have the impression that the people place me rather on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, who it is a bit on the left or on the right, it is not important really. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important one it is that we went of the front. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What counts for me, it is not that the people are of left or of right but of rallying the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I support always every solution contributing to the pretty common one, even if it is proposed by the communist party or ODS and I act tout aussi impartially contrary to bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Do you rage while anybody says about you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But does what you have declared not prove it? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> While you elaborate a flat business in a firm, you also have some optimal goal and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to approach it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some can call that of the populism, but all the suggestions that I talk about have been applied through the world and recognized experts have spoken some. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of the parliament, he does not remain you only of the slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You will not survive long in policy with that. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> You think that if you are going to see the people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing the material and criminal responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I do not have other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I need to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public opinion and to try to rally them at my camp in order to impose it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, it would not be a problem of broadcasting en direct my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties of legislating on the material and criminal responsibility of the politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors on television. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should possibly explain then why they do not want some. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> While a strong personality that will identify the abuses will be, making pressure on the scene political will be possible. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take for example the election of the president to the direct suffrage, it has been obtained thanks to the pressure from the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, without ambages, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have just launched in policy and I try to obtain the support from the majority for my program. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try to make the things advance, alone, and if that does not work, I will stop in six years and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is a bit as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that only one person can not make the difference, it is why I have gone to see a number of personalities to ask them to appear also to the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have met Radim Jančura, but it has refused because of the quantity of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I have at least supported the journalist of investigation Jana Lorencová that has revealed the frauds at the oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I have appeared because the people are really discontented but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of the people have not voted and what have made it have, for the majority, given their voice to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> To the Senate, we are only two independent ones. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have elected a Senate that in a difficult way will be able to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct suffrage of the mayors and of the prefects of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you plan to found your left specificity? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Not yet, because I do not have time of verifying if the past of every potential member is without mark and then I do not have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Neither I do not have money as my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account &quot;transparency&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Do you not have money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about fiscal declarations, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I value the value of my personal goods at about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have in Prague a ground of a value of 25 million, an apartment of a value of ten million, another apartment being 8 million, a collection of works of art of a value of about ten million, an Aston Martin that is 3,5 million and a Škoda Superb of a value of 1 million and some millions on my account worth, worth. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way, I possess an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I have always loved James Bond, who rolled by car, was courteous with the women and fought against the harm and the abuses. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You roll in Aston Martin, you have a patrimony of a value of 60 million and do you not have money as your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 million as this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I put myself in debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I do not have any sponsor shows well that my program does not arouse a great interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My expenses of campaign are globalement place settings by the remuneration that I will receive as senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live on it, for example to pay the English school of my son that costs 30 a thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only objective was of earning money, I will not appear to any election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You are therefore going to continue your commercial activities to be able to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You had not maintained that you would put your activities in mute? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I have promised it, I have partially reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my assistant will take the direction of the agency of journey at the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Nevertheless it is needed although I live on something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary while you were a contractor? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I won and I continue win between two a hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I was a president, I would put an end to my commercial activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in the edition of Saturday of the newspaper Práva. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the office MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not uniquely a business of imagination. To convince itself of it, it suffices to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books recently erected - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think that this building trade is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see&quot;, tells Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the bas-côté of the street, to us. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a great neighboring firm, calls us: &quot;Yes, it is pretty beautiful indeed, this building trade&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we have still need today from a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everybody has Internet, an iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, does no more nobody go from his full liking in one of these libraries pokers-duddies, not? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that does not have anything attractive at the doors of Rotterdam, holds a record particular enough. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The town of 80.000 souls displays the weakest rate of education of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to return some neurones at the brains, the city decided, some years ago of contributing to the general culture and of reproducing the seven imaginary bridges that appear on the tickets of euros under the form of pretty small miniatures in painted armed concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> It is thus that the authorities of the city he are reported that there was only one way of recovering the hand on the statistics: the building of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, of the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of the diagrams in bold sticks and creator of edifices full of mind and often cynics, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and appeared to the competition in 2003 with five pounds under the arm and a snigger on the face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury still looked at themselves, disconcerted and raising the shoulders, Maas, the cheeky one, piled his books of choice by order of size to make some a pyramid, and finished his supported speech of activist arguments by one: &quot;common dear&quot;! </seg>
<seg id="1514"> The this is you are are, my suggestion for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as one says, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has spurted out from earth. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The edifice is in line with a project of revitalization comprising also an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and mitoyennes houses for a total of 50 residences. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> Beginning November, the mountain of books has received the second price &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Furthermore, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> It is as this small lifeless town, which up to today did not have anything furthermore to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a stupefying ugliness, whose white fronts induce to think that they shelter a dairy, have enriched of a contemporary architectural work. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important, it is that Spijkenisse possesses now the first public cultural edifice of his history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long path to the reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell to cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Indeed, an elevator transports you at the heart of the massif, but the true joys of the reading and of the architecture open to you when you tumble the ground of the building trade to the discovery of his topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The inside entirely made of glass is luminous and clear, the ground in Dutch bricks and the elegant street lamps speak without equivocation the language of the municipal public. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> One looks already of the glance of the public benches, of the dogs and of the small boys and small girls who play at the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and still books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> In &quot;a normal way, the rays of library are along the front and in the middle finds itself a great and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; explains Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely distressed the classical spatial shape and opened the spaces of reading of the inside outwards. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The inside of the mountain of books has skillfully been fit out: in the middle find itself the offices, the Internet library, the club of chess, the center for the environment and the technical central one of the building trade. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular beauty resides in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panellings, sometimes of the parapets, sometimes of the slopes of stairs. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for the sight, to affect it and the sense of smell. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and the hardened engineers of the building trade do not want unknown materials. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials&quot;, explains Joop Trouborst, leader of the project next to the town of Spijkenisse, in a reply to the Switchboard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> It is as a day we have found in an agricultural firm frisonne an ad hoc waste stemming from the agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, one uses for years of the synthetic membrane of a millimeter of thickness as substratum in the greenhouses and the fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is a good market and one gains time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used during one or two seasons, then one can throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the effect of the heat and of the pressure, the &quot;Landbouwplastic&quot; (KPL) changes color and transforms himself into a dark, homogeneous material and Resistance worker, whose smell evokes at the same time a new car and training shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the 105 walks finds itself the mountain top. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of nearly 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us an impregnable sight on the city, but also Dutch croquettes and fici in containers. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of dampness of the air of the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Gifts for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is incredible, but in spite of all the surfaces of glass, this building trade is a model project as regards ecology&quot;, entrusts Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the edifice is settled by geothermal science. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books is below a bell of glass, the sun illuminates only little time the inside, even the days of beautiful time. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick beams in wood gone up askew in relation to the front of glass serve as pare-soleil, intercepting a great part of the rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The surrounding atmosphere is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The completely automated blind take care of the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, is already risked itself to enter to the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Mackerel Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, professeure of Chinese traditional medicine, describes even the Boekenberg as &quot;the finally found soul&quot; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Some weeks ago indeed, during the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book stemming from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This measure has allowed filling in the spaces with the library that was completely not yet covered (today, she counts 70.000 books). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The rays overflow with all parts. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, &quot;there is not anything worse than a half empty library.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I believe that our invitation has created some relationship between every citizen and this new building trade. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Each knows that his book is part of this edifice. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is only for the decoration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> It is as MVRDV has reached the mistress discipline that one calls, in the professional gibberish, &quot;the creation of an identity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Even if it can seem young and little educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally it is a matter of a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;the Germans must play a greater role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has chosen the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relationships between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention of voting against the request for the Palestinian ones of obtaining the statute from observant State next to the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But she has chosen the abstention afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve it that the Israelis have made to Gassed. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Though, Berlin must show, because it keeps individuals of the relationships with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that neither it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert his independence, without though appearing too critical to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the insurrection in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention during the vote on the arrangement of a zone of aerial exclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, the NATO imposed this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Does Germany have difficulties to adopting a clear position about the great international questions? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The reply is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is revising his exterior policy, trying to move away of a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to institute a German exterior policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans collide therefore with several foreheads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> One expects from them that they play a more independent role, but they are not to it accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they grope around still to find this role, but are on the way of a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> An exterior policy, as in France or in Great Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> That means then concretely the term of &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy for the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the will of adopting positions independent from those of the United States and of the European partners, including in what concerns the national files. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by his economic policy, therefore by the exportations and his relationships with some regions, as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: it is why Germany must protect his interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany in relation to the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention during the vote of the United Nations? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has first important openings in Middle East, especially in the countries of the Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> It is why Berlin must watch out not to strike the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arabic countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It is there undoubtedly a matter of a determiner element. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I would not match too much importance to it, because it is not a matter of exclusively unilateral relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it is in any case a determiner element there in the German strategic thoughts. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Does Germany harm his relationships with the United States choosing the abstention during important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I think that the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It is why I think that the fracture is not so serious as it was it in the case of the Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Maybe even that Germany will not be respected only anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as international actor and that his interests must be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative are diverse. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On the other hand, the United States have announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Do the opinions defer between the United States and the majority of the European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the American interior political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Administration Obama shows secretly a great understanding to the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But considering the political shape of the country, the government can not defend of course his position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinions are not so big as they seem it always. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you observe the relationships between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm with regard to the policy of Netanyahou. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Does Germany have difficulties to reconciling his narrow relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners, on the other hand? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that that does not facilitate the things for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Evidently, it would be a bit simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and regular European policy, but today, it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> They can therefore not register themselves within a vaster political line and must assert their singular position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> It is what they make presently in the question of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany will accept a role of locomotive in future and will drive Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is not simple for Germany, notably because of the relationships with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question has always been delicate. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But according to me, the Germans are pretty conscious of the fact that they must play a role that marks their independence more. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Does Germany see itself play a role of actor of weight on the international scene, does Germany want to accept only a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or well does it have always difficulties to accepting roles of foreground? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is not to it always accustomed, that is it always uncomfortable and, for evident reasons, the country has always difficulties to playing a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If one looks, for example, at the crisis of the euro, one notices that to every time that Germany decides to weigh more, numerous anti-German feelings are made to hear. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That does not facilitate the things for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, it is always the same problem: one does not want to be encircled of hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Of this point seen, Germany is in a position well more delicate than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must compromise with very varied neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the influence of the United States on the European policy makes only to diminish, but at the moment, the EU does not fill in this space, then that it remains? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if that does not please them, even if that is them unpleasant and if they are only less appreciated it is the life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the manager assigned from the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and experts in policy of Europe and of North America analyze together the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where it has specialized in German policy, in American foreign policy and in transatlantic relationships. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of the brands&quot; in China: when do Puma and Armani become in a sudden way Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known across the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo... what is it a matter of really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this name a registered trademark is hidden officially in China, but who does not have anything to see with the original firm. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The brand enjoys thus a such protection that the firm that carries the name can not lodge a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could it, it is not sure about her obtaining earnings from cause. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is more and more difficult for the foreigners of protecting their brands in China&quot;, explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the office Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the proprietorship in Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week, a new file happens on my office. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The impressionists need only some additional letters to be able to record their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, one records Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, one records Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German firms make also to copy in every legality, as Puma, the manufacturer of articles of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a file in which the recordings carried out next to the service of the brands of Beijing are. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese firm has put down the brand Zegna DF Puma, a designation that the firm has artificially created appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of way. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a well known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of the copy and of the violation of the intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the great cities, one finds shopping centers at several stories that sell only forgeries virtually. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The cases of Pattloch are though different: his constituents assign to him to attack by the way that the Chinese service of the brands confers officially to the Chinese firms the right to use a designation that is already a protégé in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese talk about &quot;Sonic boom Mingpai&quot;, of related brand. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived of &quot;Sonic boom Dakuan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that the women who marry rich men are referred to. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities say not to have anything to reproach to itself. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is bad for the businesses, one must fight against this tendency&quot;, requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is toned down, the singularity disappears, the damages for the reputation are enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the expenses of justice are encoded in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in what concerns the expensive headlight products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the data of the society of analysis of the market CLSA, China represents the third world market of luxury good and the one that develops the most rapidly, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to cross off the dubious recordings of the register of the brands and these procedures cost expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The latter can last until nine years, and the solution is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch states the trials during which the court has thrown back the complaint, because after a long period, the criticized designation had become a &quot;reality of the market&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch explains to us that if the plaintiff does not have luck, pouring the plagiarist money, because it would have harmed his brand in China, can even be obliged. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this domain, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases concern also graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the builder of machine of building site Sany, the same firm that had purchased just the producer of pumps to concrete Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> It is the reason why the Chinese can use a symbol that looks like the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, the acquisiteur of Volvo, used before a logo blue and white that reminded that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The house of way Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and of Singapore who had redirected the glance of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The service of the brands CTMO in Beijing admits however to have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and of space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Though, the service would be past the last year of a &quot;situation of urgency in the progress of the work to a found normality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of the procedures of opposition not treated would have lowered of 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, what represents an increase of 75% in relation to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain in suffering at the service. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> To act costs expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> The past year, the CTMO has received more than 1,4 million requests of deposit of brand, nearly a third more that in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the service, it is a matter of a record and that it means that China finds itself consecutive for the tenth time in mind of the classification for the number of the new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> That would be worth also for the number total of the legal brands, which is of 5,5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the service would have counted 1,8 billion of yuan of right of registration. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In Other Words, every recording has brought back on average 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle costs well more, as illustrates it the case of the German family firm Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the firm fights against a Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Indeed, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illegal fabrication of components of vehicle is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the impressionist has been able to maintain his Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;It is our mistake, &quot;because the surnames can not be protected in Germany&quot;, explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The service of the brands had therefore thrown back the objection of the Munichois. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has indeed obtained earnings from cause next to the two next authorities, but the opposing party continues fight up to today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The vigilance is of taken </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the business is in authority next to the High Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive solution of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless, it adds: &quot;The procedure is long, testing and costs a lot of time and money to us.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Evaluating the internal costs is also difficult. The service of the archives even has had to pass in review the acts of the a hundred last years in order to bring proofs. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain a &quot;big sum in euros to six numbers&quot; at the opposing party to settle the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;It is thereto that one sees what that represents for us&quot;, entrusts Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten even to overflow up to in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> It would be the case if impressionists of this region assured themselves the exploitation of the not protected brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese producer wanted to put down the name of Freudenberg for a firm of production of shoe and of leather in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The firm had for long abandoned this sector, but nevertheless it had been able to prevent the deposit. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: &quot;the vigilance is of bet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and recommend to him to the German firms of showing a great caution in their commercial relationships with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It does not suffice, according to them, to trust the international right of the brands, the foreigners rather should record also in China all what is likely to be protected&quot;, as Wentzler says it. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be well more important than those of the recording can. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the firm should pay rights of licence at the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains it. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or then, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World day of fight against Aids: hitting of the foot, to sing, to help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choral one Imbongi repeats to Heidelberg, and the orphans of the Aids of Swaziland look forward of their come. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> These are is you are the history of a link that overcomes well more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, one hits from the foot: the boots of cowboy, the basket-balls, the low-fronted shoes for the ladies and the moccasins for the men look for the rhythm striking the ground of the foot. In a very fast way, they take it on. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Afterwards, the voices of the singers increase slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano -, they rage, bewitch and follow themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years loses nearly his shoes of canvas when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild suppleness. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are a Monday night, the choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the room of music of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty singers of 23 to 69 years have come, of the généticienne in human medicine to the house-husband. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, every chorister has different words, the whole in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, to Botswana, to Lesotho, to Malawi, to Mozambique and in some regions of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Being helped to use </seg>
<seg id="1713"> The ONUSIDA, the program of the United Nations of fight against Aids, values that 34 million people across the world are affected of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23,5 million out of them live in the South on Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland counts 245.000 infected people. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Moreover, more than 40% of the population is seropositive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 orphans of the Aids of the village of Esitjeni have found godfathers in Germany thanks to the association &quot;Voices heart Africa&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them associate with a high school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros by less, one can become godfather. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This sum guarantees daily heat to the child of the money for the school, a school uniform and a meal at the sucker center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means in Zulu &quot;storyteller of histories&quot; or well still singer of praises. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Nobody can speak ordinarily the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly 10 years, the choral one repeats songs in this foreign language that it has taken in Germany to give now it back at his native region: the South of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because at 8.733 kilometers to flight of bird of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, finds itself Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral one. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% of affected people </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village counts about 2.000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or of earth and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 among them are orphan, because the HIV has carried their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> At Esitjeni, one can observe at smaller ladder the harms that overwhelm Swaziland: the rate of infection at the highest HIV and the lowest life expectancy at the world according to the UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population does not accept virtually ever the male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proved reduction of the risk of infection of half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carrying of the virus of the immunodeficiency and it is not rare to die in the middle of thirty. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a journey of group in Africa at the spring 2005, the choral one had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis have especially seen numerous children in the street at whom he missed not only the parental care, but as quite simply everything: food, clothes, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, without school diploma, there is not quite simply any perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was a matter only of whatever people who committed personally to pouring some euros every year in order to be able to send a child at the school and of offering him a warm meal by day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But hardly a year later, the choral one founded &quot;Voices heart Africa&quot;, an association that takes care for during nearly professional way of the orphans of the Aids of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Made sexually transmissible about the infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most ordinary sexually transmissible illnesses? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the bacterial IST, one counts the syphilis, the chlamydiées and the gonorrhea (or gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The ordinary IST are the HIV, the virus of the human papillome, the genital herpes or the hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The poux of the pubis and the itch belong to the parasitic IST. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the principally concerned groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The syphilis and the gonorrhea appear often at the men who have sexual relationships with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Institute Robert-Koch considers that the sexual contacts among men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five declared ones in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> By the heterosexual adults, the infections related to the chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidiasis (fongique), the gonorrhea and the virus of the human papillome are ordinary sexually transmissible illnesses. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of propagation of the HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% the new infections to the HIV are observed within this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> By the youths, one observes a rate of infections related to the chlamydiées noticeably more raised than among the other groups of population. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European summaries, the three quarters of all the infections concern the aged youths of 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Furthermore, in Germany, the virus of the human papillome is a current by the youths. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the evolution of the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Declaring all the illnesses sexually transmissible is not compulsory. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of the cases of syphilis has more that doubled in 10 years: the number is past of 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> For 2007, the number of the new infections at the HIV diminishes. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there have been about 2.700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> That represents a reduction of one tenth in relation to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a sexual illness? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious illnesses can cause abscesses at the level of the genitals, of the urinary pains, of the white losses, of the pains at the lower abdomen as the appearance of buttons and of warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do not take regularly any pain or other symptom and remain therefore hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect itself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> The condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect at 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogenic agents of the sexually transmissible illnesses also can be passed on by lubricating infection or by narrow corporal contacts. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> The experts commend therefore to every person changing sexual partners often of passing examinations regularly. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the rapidly detected IST can be cured and the late after-effects can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Thanks to the sponsorships, to the gifts, but especially to the funds that the choristers gather thanks to their voices across the whole Germany, the means build up. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;In all, already we have sent about 200.000 euros to Esitjeni&quot;, clarifies Annette Lennartz, president of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> At the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a sure woman of themselves and that obtains always what she wants, manages the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It attends also to what the orphans are well accommodated, by one of their grandmothers for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The suckers, it is as one calls the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof to them and attend to what they go every day to the school on time in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who does not have anymore anybody is received in a safe place, by Khanyisile, a woman that saw alone and is paid by the association, everything as the two cooks that prepare every day the meals for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Moreover, &quot;Voices heart Africa&quot; has created a school of sewing and allowed the building of two henhouses. With the competition of the American organization for the health PSI, the association has organized a test of detection of the HIV for numerous inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> That is not about themselves, because even if the illness is pretty visible in the whole country, it remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;Aids is a real taboo&quot;, &quot;explains Annette Lennartz, because he is a subject that affects the sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is curious enough, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of the black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his excessive way of life. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> The polygamy instead of the democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These customs sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the fast propagation of the HIV observed these last decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The migrant workers have also scattered the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> One finds nevertheless condoms to every corner of street, adds Annette Lennartz, &quot;but nearly nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh against flesh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to favor about little the cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi go off together on a trip every two or three years in the South of Africa and start to sing songs filled with nostalgia, of courage, in trust and black identity that a number of inhabitants of the point of the black continent know still time of the apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus filled with whites that sing in African language is a sign of gratitude such than it generates not only good mood and joy, but tears away sometimes as a tear from some fearsome guards-border. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus carries them always to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit to their godsons. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even if taking on the small village on a card is difficult, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to Esitjeni, you will find light&quot;, say the people over there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a journey of 8.733 kilometers to flight of bird, back at Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who hit from the foot in the room of repetition of the Bergheimer Straße, one also finds the light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger has reported proofs of the existence of ice on the Mercury planet. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The coat of ice could reach 20 meters of thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The American spatial agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the Mercury planet. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is the more close to the Sun, it contains water frozen, as three studies published this Thursday in the review specialized &quot;Science&quot; explain it. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger has reported proofs of the existence of a blanket of ice in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shade. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This blanket would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters being able to go up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have struck Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, nobody makes link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the scientist in leader of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help to understand how the water and other elements essential to the life have happened in other regions of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Unnoticed inhabitants of our planet, of the probes, of the telescopes and of the small robots as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Now and again, they send pictures to the earth, such of the small cracks through which one observes the infinity. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers of the Institute Max-Planck. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The eight planets of our solar system, as the miniature planet Cérès. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> As Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not considered as a &quot;planet&quot;, according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomical Union of 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This detail of an infrared photograph taken on by the telescope Spitzer shows a &quot;portrait of family&quot; of the innumerable generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the points pink, more difficult to identify, are the &quot;newborn babies&quot; in the room of delivery of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The telescope Spitzer has discovered this region that the stars arise, baptized &quot;W5&quot;, a well little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6.500 years-light. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The telescope Spitzer of NASA has photographed the blazing splinter of a star at dying. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The circle in the form of fritter is composed of elements that the star throws when she dies. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> In the immense Trifid nebula, at 5.400 years-light of the Earth, the gas and the dust form new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The telescope Spitzer has photographed this room of galactic delivery. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> The Groups, mass of stars also called &quot;the seven sisters&quot;, can be observed at the naked eye for the night. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Though, the telescope puts the colors more in value. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> On this infrared photo, the nebula of Hélice, as a red eye, concerns the spectator directly. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> She finds itself years-light at 700 in the constellation of the Aquarius. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> His resemblances to a land continent have been it worth the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the normal photo and of the infrared photo allows observing a spectacular shade. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the infrared detectors of the telescope Spitzer have been able to capture a picture of the new star in all his beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the greatest enigmas of the astronomy deals with the creation of the rings of Saturne. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> A theory is that the rings are the rests of a moon of Saturne that has disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without leaving of traces. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> One of the photographs the greatest and the most net that the telescope Hubble has taken on is that of the galaxy of the Whirlpool. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the shade, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become true works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The photograph published by the European austral Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifid one in the constellation of the Sagittarius, at several thousand years-light. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name of Trifid comes of the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided, shared into three), because three trails of dust divide the heart gleaming with the birthplace of the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million years-light of the Earth, the kernels of two galaxies in fusion throw one to the other one, the collision is unavoidable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The telescope Hubble has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you do not like the abbreviations technical, you can use his nickname of &quot;austral wheel of fire&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the spatial telescope Hubble shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The nebula finds itself years-light at 1.400 and is composed of grains of dust that are ten at a hundred times smaller than the ordinary domestic dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This photo has been elaborated from the optical and X-ray snapshots taken on by different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> One can see the circle composed of the black holes that is at 430 million years-light of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The spatial telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy &quot;GC 1810&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this nebula finds itself the most luminous group of young stars of our milk way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The celestial cradle gives always birth to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are connected by the nebula of the Bow, create as permanently young stars at 5.000 years-light of the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy to the luminous rays and pierced from a small black hole, there is not still dust, there is only gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The scientists think that it has been born little after the bigbang, when the universe was composed in great part of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our glance on the universe: the main telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> For, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see always more far in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Tows of the Observatory of the mount Palomar close to San Diego was the greatest telescope of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, in the United States, finds itself the Wide Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows observing the universe through two mirrors having each a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The stomach of the Gran Telescopio Canarias to The Palma, to the islands Canaries, is immense. The mirror of his alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to save money. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter reaches all the same eleven meters about. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The drawback of the method of economic building is that the telescope is set as regards the vertical corner, what limits the mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas it also is set as regards the vertical corner. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> His particularity stems from his great capacity of collection of light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> In spite of a relatively small diameter of mirror, this capacity approaches those of the greatest telescopes at mirrors of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> The scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals with the aid of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Every owner person of a computer can help in the &quot;Search heart Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI, or &quot;research of the extraterrestrial intelligence&quot;) making use of the power of calculation of his machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Seen on the austral European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here finds itself the Very Large Telescope (&quot;very great telescope&quot;), an installation worthy of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can enlighten the average infrared ghost. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The building of a very great European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also foreseen for the site of the ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> His main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1.000 elements of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will not be able to take snapshots before 2018 as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Up to in 2007, the two telescopes of Keck on the hawaïen volcano of the Mauna Kea were considered as the greatest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They wore two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The telescopes of Keck are part of the observatory of the Mauna Kea who observes the sky with the telescope Subaru and the IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of his mirror will reach 30 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration allows admiring it. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the pictures of the space the more important us come from the spatial telescope Hubble. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24th, 1990, it hands us over from the pictures of the far worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the spatial telescope Kepler looks for exoplanètes, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA has announced on February 2nd, 2011 that she had found 1.235 planets candidates from the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo illustrates the last preparations before the launching of the spatial telescope Kepler. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The spatial telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in the space as soon as possible in 2018 aboard a rocket Ariane 5. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror of the infrared spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will have notably as mission to take on light planned by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The scientists think that the South pole of Mercury shelters also ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, no reliable datum on this theory exists, because Messenger orbits well anymore close to the North pole of Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The radar data indicated for decades the presence of ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the launching of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, the scientists have now the certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1876"> In the South of Azerbaijan, numerous people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> One finds even a museum of the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An inquiry on a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the South of Azerbaijan, numerous people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> One finds even a museum of the longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An inquiry on a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The journey in the mountains Talysh is of a tousled romanticism. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> In the course of the numerous turns of the road, the small bus jogs along along wooded hills, of torrential rivers and of modest farmhouses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fruitful, one would believe itself nearly in the Forest-Black. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only at some kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that lives the ethnic group Caucasian of the name of Talysh, about which one does not know much, if it is not what they speak perfectly the Persian and the azéri and what they have a very great longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small city puts a plastron on too much with his architecture aggressive of the Soviet time that does not match at all the landscape of picturesque mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is well too hard. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Eight hours are needed to go over the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes at his reserves of oil in Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Though, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is persuaded that Lerik has the potential to become a touristic place. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku has become famous in May thanks to the competition of the Eurovision, and next year, the festival of the oldest people of the world will be here&quot;, explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It is a manager of the museum of the longevity, the only museum of the sort at the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> One can discover the life of about eighty Talysh of the region that has more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> These are is you are my grandfather, it has reached the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Having still a child at 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the star debated of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have had 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There is not however birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when one thinks that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than dubious. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;It has been born in 1805 in this region, it has died in 1973&quot;, clarifies Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man would have married three times and it would have had 23 children. To the age of 136 years, he would still have conceived a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Would Şirali Müslümov have made a mistake about some decades calculating his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist to the Institute Max-Planck of Rostock, has also intended it to talk about the man to the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;Astonishingly aged people live also in some regions on China, to Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan,&quot; explains Scholz, &quot;in Sardaigne also, there are men who live unbelievably old.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof because of the nonexistence of the documents, without counting that there was not register of registry office. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is nevertheless in fact that the people of the region of Lerik reach often an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Presently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> What is therefore the reason of the longevity in the South of this country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh, the touristic guide azéri, explains that the Talysh have particular genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the manager of the museum, thinks that it is a question of feeding. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, of a nutritional viewpoint, which the meals rich in calories of the Talysh, who like the meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and of which a lot drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for the health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or well is it the way of simple life that protects the youth from the people? At Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With his 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who maintains to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house on wood, as seeing some in the whole region of Caucasus is typical. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> It is sat on the ground beside a churn, whose contents it beats tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here only under one roof, among which one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl, who are for long adult. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children gambol also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, one prepares tea for the guests served in typical armadus glasses in the form of stomach. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly lined up, and under his scarf hide from long braids of a darkened fair-haired man that his son reveals us with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed my hair with milk, and it is as I have never lost them and that they have kept their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used shampoo&quot;, add Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly retirement suffices to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eaten what comes from his own farmhouse: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Of all my life, never I have bought the lesser food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Afterwards, she talks to us about his husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments have been after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything has improved when the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took the commands. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of the propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the paternal face of the nation, a man who has nevertheless led his country as a dictator, not connait nearly not of limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> It has been in the power up to in 2003, his son Ilham succeeded it thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Which that it is, the people aged of Azerbaijan do not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same sum that in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And maybe that the son for long graying of Mirzayeva is right: &quot;the elder ones enjoy a great respect in our culture&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the center of the great family, they are loved, neat and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This is you are are a good reason to live the longest possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The &quot;human rights&quot; omitted in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution re-is born to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The project of constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The Egyptian president is not a miser of words filled with emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must succeed at the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And this success is of my responsibility to the people and to God&quot;, it has declared on television of State. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was destined for the very whole people, but also especially for the Christian Coptic ones, to the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and laymen. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all the members of the confused and desperately divided opposition are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi has declared to temporarily have restricted the abilities of the constitutional Court, nearly apologizing, and widened hers &quot;in order to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world do not know really what wants to rescue this engineer from 61 years, holder of a doctorate of the American university of California of the South. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will the judiciary be inverted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 written articles through the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a night tour de force of fifteen hours are in a rush indeed worrying to a certain extent. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the project foresees that the jurisprudence rests on &quot;the principles of the Islamic right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that means really the word &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and that remains always a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons of fearing that the Islamists use the vague expression and the legal maneuvering space that follows from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case it is that gives to think a stipulating recently introduced article that, in what concerns all the subjects concerning to the sharia, the university al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution of the country and his splinter shines on everybody Islamic sunnite. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> That can, but does not want to say inevitably that the clergy will watch the legislative device, what would take de facto the bet under guardianship of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Numerous points of the project of Constitution are matter to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of the military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Moubarak, these courts applied themselves to repressing the opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11.000 civilians were held by the servicemen. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The State owes also, one can read in the project, protect &quot;the true nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote his morality and his values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Of a legal viewpoint, the expression is so vague that the institutions of the State even could control the contents of the cinematography art and of the literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In light, it would quite simply be a matter of censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Furthermore, no article guarantees expressly the equality between the men and the women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead of that, another article forbids to offend or to slander the prophet Mahomet or his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> On the other hand, the article does not define it that is an insult nor how it must be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Tout aussi dubious is the expression leaving to understand that it is banned &quot;to offend the people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> It suffices of outlining a caricature of the president or of telling a joke to the detriment of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Numerous points are therefore matter to interpretation in the project that Morsi subjects to the vote and that, according to his own words, will be &quot;very soon&quot; the subject to a referendum next to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The renait revolution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition mobilizes for weeks against the numeric superiority of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators have gathered in an unusual harmony on the place Tahrir in the Cairo, promising of making the sharia fall before it comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution re-is born and we are going to win&quot;, throws Hamdin Sabbahi, arrived third to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The price Nobel of the peace and ex-leader-chef of the international Agency of the atomic power Mohamed El Baradei has declared that the project of Constitution is history to be thrown to the garbage cans. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the service of instant messaging, it has accused the partisans of Morsi of wanting to instigate a &quot;putsch against the democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If it declares the referendum, one will go to his palace and one will knock it over&quot;, Jasser Said, an opponent, exclaims. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;Yet we are not tired, the blood of our brothers yet&quot; is not &quot;expiated&quot;, has declared according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Moreover, several judges have announced not to want to watch the referendum, what would take his invalidity. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Coran is our Constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Of his side, the Muslim brotherhood, well organized, has called to a contre-manifestation not on the place Tahrir as a precaution, but she on the other one holds of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the university of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The veiled women and the partisans of the salafistes, who have participated in it in great number, scanned: &quot;the people ask for the application of the law of God.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;Cleans our country&quot;!, they asked to Morsi, asserting that &quot;the Coran [was their] Constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A fighting for the sovereignty on the symbolicalness place Tharir, where everything began, in a fast way would have generated well a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Of every obviousness, it is it which the partisans of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brothers have declared that the opponents to the project of Constitution, in the same way as his partisans, had expressed high and loudly. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time of letting the people decide by the ballot boxes on the direction that the country must take. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of the Islamists will probably take away the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The human rights are not mentioned only one time&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is in anger against this taxable constitutional process that should have persisted until in February and include all the social strengths. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of the human rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers while they were in prison or in front of the courts under Moubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> It has been it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for it the human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> It is the reason for which it has been put on the wheel of blows, judged and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> &quot;And maintaining, the term is not pronounced even a time in the new Constitution&quot;, he regrets in the course of his maintenance with the Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The stretching of the powers of Morsi to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant attacks on the rules of the democracy and they will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of reinforcing the non-trading company, the president takes away all his powers from it de facto&quot;, laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Nevertheless, a democracy can not work without organizations of the non-trading company. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and of nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> That could be paid. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A demonstrator on the place Tharir warns: &quot;you give birth to a monster that he will not be you anymore possible of controlling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk of Norway: is it a matter of the most scented fish of the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people who populate Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not uniquely in Europe, but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Could the secret of the success of the country be related to the appetite of the places for an extremely scented fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take advanced cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Put them in the middle of a stack of wet and dirty clothes of foot. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you obtain the disturbing smell from the rakfisk, one of the delicacies most taken of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small city of Fagernes, at about 3 hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impregnates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in the water for a duration - according to the smell which you want it to exhale - that can go until a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When the darkness settles and what it makes cold, the Norwegians gather a lot to attend a festival that takes place here, to Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary specialty. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat vineyard, then you swallow a glass of aquavit&quot;, explains Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter in time fullness that one calls also &quot;Rakfisk General&quot;, person in charge of the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, the people swallow small pieces of fish and are slipped on a great quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer the aquavit to the rakfisk&quot;, adds Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try some pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid making it go by under your nose, it is not bad - that makes think about a sushi who would have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time that Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in impenetrable barrels of water at the air, then salted in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Afterwards, in the course of the winter, once well fermented, the fish has gone out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by the alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> To the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to take on work, emigrating principally to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> At present, the population develops rapidly - more than 13% are of the immigrants, attracted by the full job, the high salaries and a complete system of health. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The Swedish, their rival old persons whose country was it is not so long richer as Norway, cross the border to come to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital element, well that scented, of the past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> That makes left from the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small quart of beer or a sandwich will cost 10 € to you each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not make to talk often about it in the international news, what is not to dislike to him. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, the people are not disposed to talk about Anders Breivik, the extremist racist of right that has destroyed 77 people, among which of the women and of the children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> While they evoke these killings, they talk about &quot;the incident of July 22nd&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians have harm to accept that in their pacific country, one of theirs has been able to commit such an act of barbarity. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> From the beginning of the years 70, Norway owes his wealth to his oil and gas industry, one of the most important to the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But the oil is not the unique reason that justifies our success&quot;, explains Anna, our waitress, to the fair hair and to the eyes of a piercing blue, the picture of the Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk by hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are - how dites-vous - of the careful people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, as that of most of the people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are discreet, we do not love to make us notice. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed his oil wealth with a lot of caution - everything, except for a weak percentage of money stemming from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of the future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries threw the money by the windows, in the course of the years that have driven us to the crisis international financier, Norway has known to keep the cords of his grant pretty tight. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as one can ski in winter and to make of the hike in summer, we are happy&quot;, clarifies Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;Without forgetting the rakfisk&quot;, it adds in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I behave standing under the snow and I queue to buy me of what to eat - I have had my dose of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> To the menu, a hamburger composed of boost, a true discovery, it is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But tonight, the smell of the fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel in which I stay is one of the numerous places where one serves rakfisk for dinner and where one can vote for the best of between them or maybe for the most scented of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is an emission of TV where the presenter carries a knot-butterfly, surrounded with plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> One would believe itself to the competition of the Eurovision. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What score you have given to the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;These are is you are our points, Havard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> One hears laughs and clappings. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, maybe because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe it is because of the emanations of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The Mexican one Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> Then that the President entering Enrique Pena Nieto gets ready for taking his duties in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested itself to the difficulties that wait for it and to the expectations of the people, which are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The road circulation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the present time. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where the traffic jams are a legion in normal time, a dam of safety has been set up since Monday, blocking several road accesses keys in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the objective was not of preventing the people from surrendering to their work, but from preventing the demonstrators from affecting the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task waits for it. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The economics of Mexico is worn well, of the results that one owes Felipe Calderon to the outgoing president, but the country is in prey to a war of the drug that has already cost about 60.000 people the life in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government has taken the commitment to the Mexican people of reducing the violence&quot;, has declared Mr. Pena Nieto to the American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a bit earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I am going to propose a new strategy as regards safety that will allow us to reach this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before walking with the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was a governor of the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A very populated and tentacular state that fits the capital. On his earth of predilection, the opinions regarding this new leader are divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is noted down in the memory of everyone. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The places attribute it the development of the tourism and of the infrastructures in the town. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To join the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been brought to these roads, in the past bumpy and full of crevasses. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates wearing his name are hooked outside a new sport complex and of an impressive interactive museum dedicated to the climatic change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We count on it to set up lasting changes&quot;, has declared his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the conference and of the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of safety and of economics notably, we hope for a real change of which our country needs so much. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years without fault to the power, the PRI has been ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of the conference Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It throws back the criticisms of the opponents who reproach to the new president for lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He is a man whole, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He is an excellent statesman and, most of all, he knows to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, it is not always the picture that the people of their previous governor have. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> At Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the streets paved from Valle del Bravo could not be more blatant. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the overpasses of the motorways, it constitutes, to many considerations, some suburbs of the city of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> More early in the year, the servicemen have been called to the aid to fight against the gangs of drug that raged in the areas, and the violence made to the women is particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster-stricken zone, one has found, in edge of discharge, the bodies of tens of women murdered in the course of the two last years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1.000 women have been killed in the state of Mexico even though Mr. Pena Nieto was a governor, a rate well more raised than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has not succeeded in confining the problem of the murders perpetrated against the women when it was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At the worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a house in concrete, typical of this dilapidated area, Irinea Buendia fights to keep his tears while it shows me photos of his defunct girl, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version states a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family thinks that it has been killed by his partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I have arrived to her place, it has seemed to me that his body had been washed&quot;, tells the Señora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the deathly rigidity was already begun. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Even though his mother tells the history, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, beside a cross where the word appears: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, it is exactly it that the family has seen itself to refuse. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossip, an agitator of confusion, a sniveler. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want one to accept what they say and one to shut up. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But it is not normal&quot; that as many irregularities and omissions, are&quot; has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> While the President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, it will be accompanied with a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been touched by the crime in Mexico in the course of the six last years and the new president has made the promise that it would make his priority during his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be as good at so much as president that while he was a governor&quot;, has declared Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, member of the Conference. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, it is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the more. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning has not complained about bad treatments, declare the prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The prosecutors try to counter the claims of mistreatment of which Bradley Manning would have been a victim during the possession. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial deals with the possession of Manning in a military prison at Quantico, in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense wants to classify the business to the reason that the confinement of Manning has made to itself in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is marked of having hidden thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> The prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- marked of being at the origin of the biggest escape of confidential information of all the history of the American army -- has lacked numerous occasions of complaining about the bad treatments which he claims to have undergone during his military possession. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary audience at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein has maintained that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers for his nine months of possession at Quantico, Virginia, have not revealed any complaint regarding his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination -- in the course of an audience, the defense has presented a petition requiring that the business Manning is classified to the reason that the confinement has made to itself in very difficult conditions and has constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- has taken place a day after Manning has testified his desire of committing suicide during his possession. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This analyst of the military information, stopped in June 2010, is marked of having hidden thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents have been published afterwards online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During the audience of Friday, Fein has examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during his possession in the military prison of Quantico, where it has been subjected to a maximal prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officers have asked questions to Manning and have deposited his replies. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein has evoked the forms, Friday, Manning has admitted that the treatment that his guards have reserved for him was &quot;excellent&quot; and that the treatment that it had had within the prison was globalement &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms do not state any complaint for bad treatment, although the officers have directly questioned it about his prison treatment, has asserted Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning has replied that it had orally expressed anxieties regarding some problems and that the officers in visit had discussed of his anxieties and indicated that they would take care of it, but they have not deposited the evoked problems. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> They have not written &quot;any problem&quot; (to have approached after the anxieties), and for all that, that did not mean that I had not raised problems&quot;, has declared Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> Considers it military Collar. Denise Lind, has also Manning asked why he had not complained of his treatment during a maintenance in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts that it had expressed par écrit some months beforehand. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning has replied that his intention during the meeting was of making to modify his restrictive statute indicating a &quot;risk of injury&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The servicemen have declared that they had allocated him this restrictive statute -- a level below the surveillance approached for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of the others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted&quot; the staff &quot;to know that I was fine, and I wanted one to deprive me of this statute... in order to benefit from a better quality of life of my viewpoint&quot;, has declared Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning has testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and of his transfer to Kuwait, where it has been held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the base of the Body of the Sailors to Quantico, in Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He has declared to have planned to commit suicide while it was in Kuwait and to have fainted a time because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> It has added that is it of not having been had to the current from what it was going to happen to him or from what managed in the rest without the world was very harrowing. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, at this cage&quot;, has declared Manning, Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought that I was going to die in this cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once to Quantico, Manning has declared that he had spent the most clear of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning also has added that the only objects that it had were a mattress, a blanket, of the thongs, of the clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He has tried to stay on the move, because to sleep or to remain lengthened for the day was contrary to the regulations. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning has also clarified that while he tried to sleep, it had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face while it looked back the night, they wakened it in order to be able to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning has put down a formal complaint for the treatments undergone by Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning has been put in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Friday also, the judge has asked questions to Manning regarding an allegation reported in his testimony of Thursday -- what after to have been forced to sleep nude a whole night in his cell to Quantico, one has forced to him to hold itself nude in front of the guards and of other prisoners a morning, during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning has testified that at no moment, has it been allowed to him of covering itself with a blanket during the call. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning has declared that he had deduced his blanket that would have been able to hide his nakedness from the order of his guard that it had to release, but it has admitted that nobody had ordered him to release it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning has testified Thursday that it had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because it would have tried to prove an officer that it was not a danger for itself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning would have declared to the officer that it would have been able to use the elastic of his underwear or his thongs to hurt itself, but that it had not been it. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Manning has testified tonight that his underwears, his thongs, and his glasses had been withdrawn from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences that he has lived during his possession and that it will reduce considerably his sentence if it had to be pleaded guilty in front of a martial court, a trial that should be kept next at the beginning of year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has declared that Manning plans to plead guilty of the less serious offenses and to fight for the abandonment of other loads considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The audience should recover this weekend, with prosecutors that should accuse that the conditions of possession were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has confirmed Quantico that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations that govern the conditions of possession of all the prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The leaders of accusation carried contrary to Manning include the flight of goods or of public documents, the collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relative to the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all the leaders of accusation are kept, he incurs the life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My identitaire crisis mexico-américaine </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He says about opportunities that a lot have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack </seg>
<seg id="2144"> The Mexicans have tendency to blame those that have left; they remind to the Mexicans the difficult periods, it has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Said Navarrette that the Mexico-américains find themselves between two worlds busy. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent journey in Mexico City, arriving to the hall, in the face of the services of customs and of immigration, I have felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two ways: one for the &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for the &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I have remained still for several seconds, not knowing what line to head for. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I have grown in the center of California, where one has called me the &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is a matter of an ethnic qualifier, to the same one titrates as the one that my friends of Boston use while they are said &quot;Irish&quot;, or my friends of New York while they tell to themselves &quot;Italian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Afterwards, I have become &quot;Mexico City-American&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the earth that has not seen be born my grandfather, any need of special qualifier or of hyphen. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, sufficiently well to manage a maintenance in one or the other language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and I can not lose my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Then I have taken my American passport and I have headed for the line &quot;foreigners&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I have thought about that moment of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto has visited to the President Obama, at home-White. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Generally, while the leaders of these two countries meet, their themes of predilection are the immigration, the drug and the business. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto had also desire of talking about the growth of the Mexican economics, which is one of the reasons that drive the Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than to risk itself in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wishes to ally itself with the United States and with Canada, and to create a Union for the business on the model of the European Union, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto commits to hounding the war against the cartels with the drug in Mexico, although it has not supplied more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most of the Americans have probably never thought that in 1848, the United States have invaded Mexico and forced his leaders to give up par écrit the half of their territory at the point of the rifle by the way. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Consequently, as soon as an official U.S. states the lesser criticism towards Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- of the complaints on the way of which the Americans undermine to the sovereignty of their neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma look for the fight. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And nevertheless, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country keeps with the more than 35 million of Mexico City-Americans that live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want one to approach the subject of the bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are a lot. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has his winners and his losers, of the people for whom the country offers opportunities and of other for whom the country does not offer some. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a given moment, in our genealogical tree, a person, maybe a parent or a big-related, has not taken on any opportunity in Mexico and has had to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And the most often, this person corresponded to a type profile -- a darkened skin, little educated, stemming from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not the Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we live the American dream presently, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight which it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is evident. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We match it to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Besides, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is reciprocal. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them a humiliating defeat and they eye us as if we were individuals of inferior and not sufficiently Mexican stock. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our connections to Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed while they lived in Mexico, they would never be parties. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we would not meet ourselves wedged from the good side of the fence, living comfortably to the United States, but as lost souls. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My woman who has been born to Guadalajara and who has emigrated legally to the United States even though she was a child, reminds to me that there are frictions between the Mexicans and the Mexico City-Americans, because the Mexicans claim more firmly their identity and the Mexico City-Americans are annoyed. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although she is an American citizen, it has the feeling of being part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Besides, of numerous Mexico City-Americans that I know do not have the impression to be part of a country or of the other one. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We adore the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of the two worlds, but we are not settled in any of the two of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, one considers us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, one considers us as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate a bit more the relationship, as I have learned it for my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia want to approach the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want that the Mexico City-Americans work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing his interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We will have to explain haughtiness which it is needed absolutely to visit to our American compatriots that Mexico is a country and put the political leaders the pressure to reinforce the connections to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if one considers the inequalities of salary, the corruption and the violence related to the drug that are omnipresent, many of us are not persuaded that it is a matter of a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You are going to have to manage alone, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not still ready to forgive the United States in the way in which they have treated Mexico there are a century and a half, consequently they must accept only certain Mexico City-Americans want them always in the way in which the members of their family have been treated it is not so long. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Maybe we are more &quot;Mexicans&quot; than I thought it. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas is still a failure for the peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will a lasting peace never be able to be between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another burst of blood seems to indicate that such a hope is empty. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While the same futile arguments persist to know who has begun, tens of buildings trades have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, of the drawn rockets of Gassed have landed close to Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem blocked in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full transformation. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arabic spring everything has made to fly into pieces, and that one wants it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Maybe that their fight will intensify still a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Nevertheless, there are all the reasons of thinking that that could help them to go out from this mortal deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that does not make no loser nor no winner </seg>
<seg id="2215"> To first sight, showing seems difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st persists, the fightings of this week have reinforced the partisans of the strength, of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamist movement that leads Gassed it for 2007, will boast of having forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gassed has suffered a hiding. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> To have killed some of his leaders and frustrated the 1,7 million inhabitants of Gassed in one of the most poverty-stricken and overpopulated corners of the planet, Israel has not succeeded in destroying the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, the Hamas wins of the ground on Cisjordania, the other part of Palestine presently to the hands of their rivals of the Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Furthermore, the leaders of the Hamas could tell themselves that the time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of the Islamists of the Arabic world is more and more strong, and the Hamas has made of the rich and powerful friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power in full expansion, in the past the Muslim ally the more close to Israel, has taken fact and cause for the Hamas; all as Qatar, one of the states the richest and the most dynamic of the Golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The members of the Hamas exult and say that the Islamist croissant bends around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the militia of the Hezbollah exercises his domination, passing by Syria, where the rebels to tendency Islamist can knock over Bashar El Assad, and up to the Jordan, where the allies of the Hamas threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And the most important, on the south flank of Israel, the ascent of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the more populated and the most central of the Arabic countries, has changed the balance from the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, this despot who has governed Egypt for 30 years up to his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to the Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of the Hamas, and their leaders leave more easily to the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the future diplomacy, the Hamas can emerge as actor from importance that will not be able to be excluded anymore even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> For this time, the partisans of the hard line of Israel will pull the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, the Hamas has been replaced in box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The system of interception of missiles called Iron Dome has proved his effectiveness and numerous missiles of the Hamas have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis are going to be able to sleep on their two ears - for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews his indestructible support; and numerous European countries have reproached to the Hamas for being at the origin of the last wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But especially, Israel has prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the premier-ministre, which has totally ignored the process of peace. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the shootings of rockets of Gassed have killed about 30 Israelis for 2004, Israel has been saved by the suicide attacks, notably thanks to the fence of separation that encroaches upon Cisjordania, the main piece of it that could be a Palestinian state, and who protects the Jewish colonies that continue spread in spite of their illegality as regards international right. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> M. Netanyahu, of which the Likud party has merged with a still more bellicose party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman to the approach of the election of January 22nd, has the part beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why to coddle these Palestinian scarves giving them a state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they led Cisjordania, they would not throw rockets, as their compatriots have been it to Gassed? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is preferable of keeping them behind this wall and of striking them as soon as they take out the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Maybe that the partisans of the hard line will take it; but it can itself that the Arabic spring changes gives it. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists who take the power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be of attacking the problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The budget of the defense of Israel is more important than that of his four combined Arabic neighbors is. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Beginning a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arabic governments to sort out their economics. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> M. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire what is good augur -- and the beginning of something could stand out. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also think in future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arabic world that becomes more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to the self-determination can to create a powder magazine that is dedicated to explode a day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit as the bus that has exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression weakens already the democracy in the Jewish state, and the demography exacerbates this problem as the Arabic population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gassed all two or three years to ring the Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic plan. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be moved by those of the outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The residence reply that advocated by the reasonable people that one finds of every side, and by most of the exterior world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory through Israel in return for the safety. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the occasion to the exterior people of defending this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must get down now to put an end to the circulation of weapons to Gassed, in the same way as Turkey and Qatar, better is put than never to persuade the Hamas of accepting the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with exchanges of ground and a divided Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The Arabs of the exterior countries should also make pressure on the Hamas and the Fatah so that they unite. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would contribute well more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next suggestion from a pseudo state to the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> M. Obama has also every interest to what Israel accepts to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> In the course of his first mandate, it has not presented his flat specificity of peace. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at home-White, it seems tout aussi reluctant to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is a very étriquée vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is a vital stake for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> That goes by by an agreement of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws for packets of neutral cigarettes are applications in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and photos of ill organs cover the green packets dark that are everyone identical, whatever is the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> This application law in Australia is a first world, the logos and the colors have been replaced with a green dark olive and of horrible photos of ill organs and of the representations of children and of babies of which the illnesses have been caused by the nicotine addiction of their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Outside the different photos and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packets, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packets. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is a matter of the strictest system at the world as regards wrapping of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian federal government has declared that the objective was of dissuading the youths from smoking removing every glamour representation. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if the people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is 99% of chances that they never begin. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;Even while they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by the manufacturers of tobacco through their brand image&quot;, has declared the federal minister of the health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have revealed for example that the children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Even if Australia records the weakest rate of nicotine addiction at the world and if these changes have only little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries envisage an analogous move. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The industry of the tobacco has made pressure against this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The manufacturers of tobacco have declared that that would relaunch the business of the black market, which will give more easily access to less expensive cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;Harmful consequences will follow from this legislation&quot;, has declared Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The forgers of China and of Indonesia will sell well more cigarettes of forgery in the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others have declared that this law had energized their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family firm, has declared that asks for it of cigarette cases, notably in silicone to conceal the horrible wrappings, strongly had increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have contested the law and lost in front of the high court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha has declared that Zico has sold 6.000 to wholesalers and is on standby of renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, the businesses are good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only boredom, say the experts, is the popularity of the social media and settles it of population targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of Australian laws forbidding the advertisements to the TV, the sport sponsoring and the obligation for the resellers to conceal the cigarettes, the marketing of the tobacco is at present available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has forbidden the advertisement on the Web by the firms and the local sites, but it can not prevent the foreign sites of making some. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you work tobacco in the marketing and that you have more only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the inescapable place above all&quot;, has declared Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase of the contributions of some citizens lambda in favor of the brands on social media as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask for us if it is a matter of a simple citizen who adores the cigarettes Marlboro and who has worked hard grieves it of making a video, or if it is a matter of a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia has declared that the industry concentrates on the new regulations in force rather than on the marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone up to paying Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new decisions of justice - these countries have declared to the WHO that the business is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had important commercial exchanges with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A decision of OMC should be made in the current of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek has declared that the government had taken after the discussions with other countries regarding analogous laws on the wrappings. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada has been the first country to make compulsory the photos of warning on the wrappings in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, of which Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> More severe laws are presently at the study in England, Nouvelle-Zélande, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Numerous smokers in Australia are insensible to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos do not disturb me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You take a cigarette and you order the packet&quot;, has declared Victor El Hage at the moment of buying a packet on which a photo of tumor of the mouth appears. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be a franc, the only reason that will make me stop, it is my small girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, managing &quot;King of the Pack tobacconist&quot; in the center of Sydney, has declared that the uniformity of the wrappings made difficult the tidying of the packets on the displays. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Before, I was needed an hour to unload a parcel, now, I needs four hours&quot; has declared Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had only to forbid them a good time for all and we would have said OK, it is good, one stops and one puts the key under the door&quot;, it has added, raising the arms to the sky. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly connected world, being bored can be good. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I have spent five hours in an airport for the period of Thanksgiving, because our airplane had mechanical problems and we have had to expect the arrival from another airplane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Consequently, I have had sufficiently of time to think about the theme of the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> To spend a half-day in an airport to wait for a flight is boring enough, even while you have books, magazines and iPhones to divert yourself (without forgetting the stores of duty-free). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child make the praise of the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - of being bored from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> That forces the brain to take paths interesting, indeed of feeding the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the majority, constantly in the face of several types of screens, we do not know the benefits of the boredom anymore. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Then should we receive the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will come back there. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First and Foremost, like many people, I thought that the boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, notably since we have more spare time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But it is not the case, declares Peter Toohey, teacher of gréco-romaine history to the University of Calgary, to Canada, and to author of &quot;Boredom: In Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The boredom goes back to very far&quot;, it says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompéi depict Latin graffitis that evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Afterwards, there is the definition that we give to the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in different ways, has declared John D. Eastwood, aggregated teacher of psychology in the York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After having skimmed through numerous publications and subjected the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, the Teacher Eastwood and his colleagues have defined the boredom as being an experience that consists &quot;to want to make something, but without managing to launch into a satisfactory activity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differs the boredom from the apathy, it says, it is that the person is not starting a task well that she would wish for it. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With the apathy, it says, there is not the desire of making something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is boredom to the heart, it has declared, it is &quot;the break of the process of attention, associated with a sullen mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The boredom can strongly look like a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But the Teacher Eastwood has declared that if the two can be bound, the people who are bored have tendency to think that the problem comes of the environment or of the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes of them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes, thinking that we are bored even though it is actually a matter of a problem of concentration happens to us. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Within the framework of their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention &quot;, which has been published in the newspaper &quot;Perspectives one Psychological Science&quot; in September, the Teacher Eastwood and his colleagues have brought to the fore an older experience in which the participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person at lira an article of magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard, from the room nearby, the too high sound of an emission of TV that did not have any relation, others have everything fair heard the emission of TV, and the third group does not have at all heard the soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those that have heard the TV at a weak level sound have said that they were themselves more annoyed than the two other groups - them have had of the harm to concentrate, but did not know not why, and have attributed this problem of concentration to the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> While you try to concentrate on a difficult or setting task, a break of the attention can drive to the boredom, has declared Mark J. Fenske, an aggregated teacher of neuroscience to the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, while you carry out a boring task, &quot;as looking at objects on an assembly line, the music can help you not to be bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Actually, it says, at present, we know that while one twists itself or that one scrawls, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are in good fact one means of remaining physically more agile. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that the children who are allowed to fidget learn more and keep more information than those that are forced to remain without moving&quot;, has declared the Teacher Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We are bored everyone a day or the other one - the delay of my flight of airplane, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly boring film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are likelier to be bored than of other. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure that, researchers have developed a &quot;ladder of predisposition to the boredom&quot; in the years 80. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The ladder includes assertions as, &quot;Among the tasks that I carry out, many of them are repetitive and monotonous&quot;, and &quot;I have so many centers of interest that I do not have time of making everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using such a ladder, the researchers have discovered that the boys have tendency to be bored more often than the girls, has declared Stephen Vodanovich, a teacher of psychology to the University of West Florida, and need notably numerous and varied stimulations. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, the adolescents are in a fast way blasé. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a teacher in development individual and European to the University of Illinois, has taken an experience in the course of which he has contacted close to 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He has summary that 32 percent of the adolescents declared to annoy itself to the school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent declared to be bored while they were not in the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents have declared to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> The teacher Larson has declared that he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, is 21 years later, more would be raised or inferiors. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But it has added that he knew that &quot;the adolescence is a period where the boredom reaches his highest level&quot;, notably because the children and the adolescents do not have much of control on it which they want to make. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I rest my question: is the boredom good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in his extreme form, that can take the people to take absurd physical risks, to make bets or to abuse some substances to spend the time, as the studies show it. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, of numerous philosophers and writers evoke a link between the boredom and the creativity, has declared the Teacher Vodanovich, who studies the problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;The boredom is the means that the brain has found to make yourself to know that you should make something else&quot;, has declared Gary Marcus, a teacher of psychology in the N. Y. U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not know always what is the most appropriate thing to make. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are bored and that you use this energy to play the guitar and to cook, that will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the TV, that will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Then if your child is bored and that you give an iPad to him, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care all alone nor to selfadjust oneself, declares the teacher Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &quot;these pass selfregulations of a situation to another&quot;, it declares. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child does not learn only to entertain, it obtains more mastery from itself in other domains. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think that we should glorify the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> All as I do not think either that we should criticize it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> To feel comfortably outside the constant bubbling that the activities and the technology generate is the objective that we should tend towards. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> The teacher Eastwood is agreed on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We need to be bored more often, but the boredom awakens a shrill and frenetic desire of being connected to something that has sense&quot;, it has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to it, what the people search for, it is a means of disconnecting oneself and of appreciating the times of stopping. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated&quot;, it has added, &quot;it is difficult to take on means of launching into something when the noise stops.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive for the new law on the marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19 years, student in a university and player of foot in Colorado, is accused for something that will become soon legal in his state: the possession of meatballs of marijuana and of a pipe used to smoke them. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> M. Orozco has declared to Lamar, in the middle of the fields, close to the border with Kansas, that a day, in September, it and some friends were aboard a car when they have been stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officer has found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco has received a quotation to appear for possession of drug and material being able to use to his consumption - of the minor offenses, each being accompanied with a fine of 100 $ - and a date of appearance. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated as criminals&quot;, has declared Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it one? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> For the weeks of uncertainty that have followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for his personal use, the brought reply to hundreds of businesses implying a weak use of drugs depends more of the place that of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, who has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offenses implying the use of marijuana have been classified without continuation. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police departments have stopped accusing adults of 21 years and more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the weeks to come. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the prosecutors who find themselves more conservative in the districts of Colorado have called to accelerate the existent businesses of marijuana and continue accuse the people who possess some. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> In parallel, several cities of the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West vote presently to prevent the opening of businesses of sale of marijuana recognized by the State in their areas. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;The things evolve so rapidly that I do not know what the future reserves for us&quot;, has declared Daniel J. Oates, the leader of the police of Aurora, to the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The organisms of rules of Washington land also not badly of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are in search of directives on the way of installing a system of license, allowing to produce, producing, distributing and selling - before buffer dates it of 1st December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, that one wants it or not, is early on the majority states as regards rules on the marijuana, first and foremost regarding the use at therapeutic ends and maintaining the personal use in what concerns. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, and constitutes a good indicator&quot;, has declared Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place nor system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can make more only to suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;There is not previous reality on which we could rely, it has said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, what leaves a space legal of a year, during which the system of license will not exist always, even though the possession of marijuana will be legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> For this time, practical questions remain in suspens: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees an access appropriate to the recognized marijuana and forbids the installation of businesses of sale of cannabis in a ray of 30 km around a school, of a park, of a playground or of a day-nusery. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;Places more difficult than the urban zones will not be to install a recognized business of sale of cannabis, he &quot;notably in the metropolitan zone of Seattle&quot;, has declared a group of research lately formed Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Center of legalization of the cannabis. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On November 21st, the leader of the police, Oates, to Aurora, has sent an e-mail to his announcing officers that the &quot;City attorney&quot; (district attorney) would not pursue more the people of 21 years and more that possess small quantities of marijuana, and that the police had to stop accusing people for this type of offense &quot;to effect immediate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Leader Oates has declared that the police would apply the new decisions of justice that regulate the activity of those that cultivate the marijuana to medical ends, and that it would continue pursue the traffickers of drug and the dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the &quot;attorney district&quot; (Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, incarnates a stricter vision. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he has declared that his office would continue be occupied of the businesses of possession of marijuana, principally in order to make pressure on the users so that they are made detoxify. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the Present Time, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but many of them are the subject to other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our office has the obligation to bring pursuits against these people that have committed an offense that, at that time of the facts, was a recognized offense&quot;, has declared Mr. Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions have been complicated even in rural places as Mesa County, where the voters have thrown back the initiative in favor of the consumption restricted from marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the greatest city of the county, do not make to appear anymore of adults for possession of limited quantities. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The district attorney of the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but he has also decided not to classify all the businesses of possession of marijuana without continuation. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not have the impression to lose my time to continue apply the law &quot;until it changes&quot;, it has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 pourcent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, to offer an appropriate legal and governmental frame to the personal consumption of marijuana is not an easy-off thing. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities bring the deep ambivalence to the fore among the official places in what concerns the legalization of the marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;It is a matter of a cultural fence&quot; with the district attorneys, has declared Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver that represents the people marked of consumption of marijuana and who expresses himself as local spokesperson of the &quot;National Organization heart the Reform of Marijuana Laws&quot; (National organization for the reform of the laws on the marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have passed a good part of their life to hound in justice with the people who consumed marijuana, also, they have harm to accept that it is legal&quot;, it has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As first states to treat the consumption restricted of marijuana at the same level as that of the alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on the way to becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Even though the defenders and representatives of the State foresee a new border of legalized sales, they expect with anxiety the directives from the federal government, which conceives always the sale and the culture of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The defenders of the legalization of the marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice cèdera. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> In spite of some mediatized arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and of salesmen, the federal government has especially allowed to the businesses of sale of marijuana at therapeutic ends of working in Colorado, to Washington and in 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police are probably not going to push in the doors to seize small packets of drugs, it is strong to bet that it opposes the recognized businesses of sale of marijuana to personal use authorized by the new laws, has declared Kevin A. Sabet, a previous political adviser of the administration Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Numerous cities of Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Well before the votes, some local administrations have approved of moratoriums regarding the creation of the new businesses of sale of marijuana, even if it is a matter only of a postponement of a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the city of Montrose has obtained a moratorium from 6 months, and should impose this ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to find oneself in a situation where a license is agreed to somebody and to find afterwards ourselves confronted with a federal problem&quot;, has declared Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Many questions land. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I have been manhandled and excluded from Oxford, because I was one &quot;Tory&quot; (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not uniquely the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Also far that I remember, always I have dreamed of entering to the University of Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my elder brother have studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowing, a kind of Greek amphitheater of the modern times that stimulates the two pillars of the civilization, the free thought and the tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Nevertheless, two weeks after m to be installed in Worcester College at the end of the years 80 to study the history, I have decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father has collapsed and has started to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were disconcerted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper of L&apos;Evening Standard has claimed that I had left this university, because I had put forward to the fact that students of the first and second year had sexual relationships in the bedroom beside mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author Has. N. Wilson has declared with joke that I had left after having been forced to drink in chipped cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I have run away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I have run away, because I had been a victim of intimidations and the subject to constant vexations. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my rather extreme name, nor because of the fact that I came of a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for an only and unique reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I have been a victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a recommended very influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was partisan of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why to evoke that today, you will call me. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students of center-right undergoes the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The hatred increasing and institutionalized of the students Tory in Oxford is such a that last week, some of them have required a protection of their rights, in the same way as those of the gays, of the handicapped people and of the ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The conservative members of the room of the students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College have declared that &quot;they&quot; were often isolated &quot;, attacked personally and felt undesirable&quot; because of their political opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want a representative within the Committee of the university for the equality of the chances to be so that their opinions can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and one the Right (&quot;The country of the wonders: Young, Intelligent and of Right &quot;), devoted to the policy by the students, and who disheveled the &quot;Tories&quot; as eccentrics and neonazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> One uncovered notably the student Joe Cooke, previous president of the &quot;Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)&quot;, who moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a complete silver and moves with a cane to chromium-plated head. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, the conservative students say to be treated as scapegoats of the arrangement of the increase of the expenses of schooling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the &quot;Nottingham University Conservative Association&quot;, has declared to a newspaper of the Sunday &quot;that there is a party seized by left growing in the universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> The people think that we are as the Bullingdon Club even without having met.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 years, student in history to the Corpus Christi, which has proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the people who are of center-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;That constitutes a hindrance to the freedom of the intellectual debates, as to the well-being of the members&quot;, it has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think of the sort in the course of my first weeks spent in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I have gone in September 1986, I was then aged of 18 years and of a paralyzing shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The previous year, the university had voted for the refusal to give Margaret Thatcher - an alumnus - a ceremonial title, because of the reduction of the financing of the superior studies. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the week of reception, when the new students have met the others and the teachers, I have had a foretaste of what was going to happen thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I have discovered that the teachers not only participated to the sarcasms to the students Tory, but that besides, they took pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy about the striker minors, of the privatization and of the opposition of the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first sarcasm of which I have been a victim concerned a translation to the English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Beauty queen Wyatt&quot;, has said the teacher Harry Pitt (maintaining dead), &quot;want to translate the first paragraph&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I have lost foot. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man at the pustular face, raged easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;East-it that the Thatchéristes refuse to learn the French or are just stupid&quot;? has it asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students have laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The tears burned me the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest to you to take lessons of French during your spare time - finally, if you are not too busy with making you of the friends&quot;, it has thrown of an aggressive tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I have returned to my bedroom, disconsolate. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> During the dinner tonight there, I have sat alone then I have felt a light slap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a student in second year of studies of English, appointed James, that has appeared as member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know that you are&quot;, it has said, in a kind way. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I have well fear that it is thus. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Every person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken on for target. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, that will be therefore still harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the youths Tory claim to be of the Plowing (Labor Party members). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at the local pub, I have loosely tried to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I have stressed the fact that I was not agreed with all what Mme Thatcher had said. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This stratagem has failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences that, ironically, had studied to Eton, has said: &quot;You are the girl of a fascist pork.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have recovered the chorus. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was corrupted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How do the Tories make the love&quot;? has asked for one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They worry ones the others, &quot;it is not&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I have felt as the homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the years sixty. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I only have been able to take a normal life to Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same viewpoints uniquely after the nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Plowing and renounce my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years to come were going to look like a purgatory of ostracism and of isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, teacher of modern history, which taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> It was hated not only because it was conservative, but also because it was to recommend talks about politics exterior of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was nearly never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as his adhesion to the viewpoint Marxist-determinist of the history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a post of teacher at the university of Bilkent, in Ankara, in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here&quot;, it has called me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I have started operating a shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge next to my family and of my friends more open city-dwellers of mind. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I have told to my father that I hated Oxford and have explained to him why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> It was incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies in Oxford, in the years forty, all the political viewpoints were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place to the world&quot;, it has called me pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They would not make that, not in the city at the dreamy steeples. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> It had the tears at the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Leave them a luck. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure about it being to tease you. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> That the heart would break me if you left Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired by my frequent journeys in London, my emotional resistance has progressively deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and has renounced his convictions. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> In the course of a session of works led next week, when another teacher of history has suggested the most seriously people, which I was &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, I have decided to make some as much. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Blushing interiorly of shame, I have admitted to be a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and treated them as &quot;old person madmen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite has been of short duration. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It is my father that has pushed in the last nail of my oxfordien coffin. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At this time, it wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch every week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I have remained crouched in my bedroom, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they have left, I have made my suitcase and I have taken the first train for London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I have never returned to it. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat me as pleurnicharde sissy. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no child of 18 years should be a victim of such an intimidation in a school. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The most tragic is that it was a matter of Oxford, that not only has produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but benefits also from a steadfast reputation of equality and of freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers the elegance to the reputation&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Within the framework of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: one Master of the Sewing, inaugurated this week in London, ABC has questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and of other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Somerset House, the old residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The fashion designer has recognized it during the inauguration of &quot;Valentino: a Master of the Sewing&quot;, a prestigious retrospective that gathers more than 130 models of high sewing created for his fashion house in the course of the 50 last years. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;I adore this palace&quot;, he has declared with his inimitable accent Italian. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> This exhibition is the pause of a history whose only protagonist is &quot;him signore&quot; Garavani, but that would not have been able to be written without his first-rate customers. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> In the first room of this exhibition, opened until next March 3rd, one finds an impressive number of private letters and of photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from the princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, going by by the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Valentino displays his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: of the modest fashion designer of the city of Voghera, to the north of Italy, to the idol of the jet-set international. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> There is not anything of harm to like the monarchy. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;At least, they do not crush their stubs of cigarettes on your magnificent carpet as some stars of the pop music make it&quot;, declares the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> In the years 60 and 70, we lived all two in Alps and we were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> &quot;We adored everyone to be invited in his chalet of Gstaad&quot;, explains the ex-femme of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, personal friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the reputation. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> And even thus, he is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, carrying a model Valentino </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The model silvery, Valeria Mazza, does not have either forgotten the charisma of the fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Several years ago, after a procession on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we have gone to dine at his apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were twenty people, among which Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> One saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> &quot;With it, every guest felt important and appreciated&quot;, remembers the &quot;model beep&quot;, which has started working with it for the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> &quot;He will not pass ever way, because his creations are works of art,&quot; it finishes. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Procession of descendants of nobility </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but of divided loves. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves the people pretty high and with the greatest titles and they also love it. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters of width sea that proposes by exchanging the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must march on the podium to admire a &quot;public&quot; of dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristote Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti carried in &quot;The Notte&quot;, or a coat in wool and coat having belonged to the empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among this public of models, one finds names as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and the fashion designer in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of his customers say that the first clothes Valentino are as the first love, &quot;impossibleness to forget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember some perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a matter of some pants, of a shirt, of a vest &quot;gillette&quot; and of a jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> &quot;It is a present that it had been me&quot;, has declared Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the fashion designer. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;I prefer it to all the others for his femininity, his great love of the women, and &quot;because he sublimates our beauty&quot;, add the ex-duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I like much the colors that it uses, they are luminous and light up the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can not, it not more, to forget the first time that it has carried a model Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> While it was adolescent and lived in Italy, it dreamed of having the age and the occasion of carrying one of his dresses of evening... </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, that was possible at the end of the years 90. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I have bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, the prince Edouard of Line. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was a dress of red evening, with a skirt to steering wheels, a draped bustier and a neckline to fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It was a dream become reality&quot;, has declared the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> &quot;Valentino is indifferent in fashion, he is obsessed by the timeless one&quot;, explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The princess of Arenberg preserves the dresses of evening of the fashion designer with &quot;the greatest care, because an evening dress is not a dress only, it is also the unity of the memories &quot;that it conveys&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The &quot;king&quot; of the fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The final great one of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller carried during his marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (the fashion designer calls thus his dressmakers) have been needed to realize this dress in silk ivory with inlayings of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a train of four meters and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high sewing of the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of the customers of the high society&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed for years by the &quot;knowledge-to be&quot; nobility, Valentino is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of The Order of the Arts and of the Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his customers. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> &quot;His refinement, his quietness, his neat and perfect aspect always have jumped me to the eyes&quot;, recognizes of Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time that I have seen it, it was a month ago to a dinner of gala to the Museum of Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> It was sat to the table of the countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was perfect, the years do not have any effect on it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is a princess that says it... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest profession of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the messengers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur across the steep paths of stone. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is a hell and of other who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who win their life carrying sulphurs it from the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> He must work every day up to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating of the entrails of the earth solidifies to the contact of the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After having gathered great rocks of sulfur, which weigh altogether close to 70 kilos, it installs them in two baskets in bamboo that he loads on his shoulders across the steep paths. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that towers at 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted messengers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, to an appearance of turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and to fall in the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that a fake step could cost them the life, as that has happened to a French tourist who made a fall mortal in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The minors of Kawah Ijen earn 5 centimes of euro for every kilo of extracted sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> One time above, him him clear a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were animals of circus, and carrying the heavy baskets in a hard way, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the pair of scales that a mining society has installed a bit below to 1.850 measure of altitude. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is a matter of PT Candi Ngrimbi, a firm that exploits the volcano for 1960 and, one can say it, his employees, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 centimes of euro) by kilo of sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It sells it afterwards at 10.000 rupees (83 centimes of euro) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in the daily life and is used to produce candles, of the fires of device, from the cosmetics, from the dynamite and is used even to whiten the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we transport 70 kilos about, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) to every journey&quot;, explains us Anto, who carries out in general three journeys by day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Each takes 3 hours from it and it finishes exhausted, but that allows him to earn 138.000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although that seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the treble of what it would win in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The income of the minors is very high here, where the harvest of the coffee is paid 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros) by day and where the monthly average salary is of two million rupees (167 euros)&quot;, declares the messenger who worked in the past as bricklayer on the touristic island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Over there, his salary was of 75.000 rupees (6.20 euros) by day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto has fallen close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulfur: &quot;I have married a young girl of Bali, where they are hindouistes, and I have brought it back in Java so that it converts itself to the Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At 27 years, he has passed three of his life to challenge the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur already has started making to him to pay the bill although he covers itself the face with a mask and door of the special gloves. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases thrown back by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> It is the price that he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I am going to work still two years, because I want to open a store or to study the Spanish or the French&quot; promises you him in an English more that satisfactory. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Manhandled by the life, this nice and intelligent teenager could be touristic guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of that, it does the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a hovel of insalubrious wood with other messengers, raises every day at two hours of the morning because the sulfur does not stop spurting out the night, while his characteristic yellow color becomes blue and it sparkles in the middle of the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging the darkness, Anto goes down to the crater lighting up itself with a small light set to his helmet, that he he is bought itself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 messengers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> In spite of his comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sulfur to save the costs and does not supply any equipment to the messengers who work on their account and are paid at the weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Furthermore, they do not touch either one under of the 30.000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase by device photo, on top of the entry of 15.000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park invoice to the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is done for the animals, not for the human beings&quot;, protests Madrusin, a stout messenger of 42 years who works in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he has left the school. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working &quot;as long as it will be able it&quot;, because it needs money to bring up his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur damages fills it and irritates the eyes while the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke that go out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains about suffering from the serious illnesses... to which add evidently their usual respiratory problems, oesteoarthritis, pains in the knees and the shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged of 53 years, can only load 50 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, his companions and it extract 15 tons of sulfur of the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, at 18 kilometers of there by a path of goats invaded by the bad herbs. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life&quot;, asserts Unainik opening well the mouth, unveiling several missing teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The elder one of his five children, aged of 30 years, works also as messenger of sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The pass time, but the misery perpetuates of generation in generation one of the most difficult professions to the world: the one that the human mules of the volcano Kawah make ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore searches for babies to save the economics </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singaporeans throw the responsibility of this absence of children on the career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore must develop&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let&apos;s fill our civic duty and let&apos;s give the life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It can seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for lozenges to the mint, but in spite of that, or maybe thanks to that, the video has spread as a trail of powder on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come of a group of rap that uses local references as are &quot;going to put a puppet in the drawer&quot; to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the publicity agency at the origin of the video, hopes to attract the attention on the problem in an amusing way thanks to this advertisement. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> His creative manager, Douglas Hamilton, has declared that he wished to use the power of the music so that the people filled &quot;their national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is destined uniquely for the Internet, we have therefore been able to make it amusing and amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is a matter of the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst at the world in the domain of the birth rate, thus we felt that it was a theme that we had to approach. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tempted several things as launching perfumes at the pheromones or organizing evenings of speed-dating. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative but they have inevitably not worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> We are us therefore said the next thing: that of more creative to solve this problem that of making some a song of rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The government of Singapore does not take it as much rashly. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1.300 dollars WAYS per annum in policies to encourage to his citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favor of the marriages and of the fathers agrees up to 15.000 dollars by child, lengthens the leaves of maternity and distributes fiscal profits. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all that has had few effects. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich city-state and high technology of the South-East of the Asia, also known for the conservatism of his leaders and his strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with his national distribution of population, is located presently to 1.2 children by woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time that it has been above 2, considered as the rate of renewal, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why therefore do the Singaporeans not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, manager of the policies of the marriage and of the family of the National Division of the Population, asserts that it is owed to a &quot;better education&quot; and to &quot;a broader choice of opportunities of career&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;That has allowed to the people to have a broader scale of options in terms of objectives of life and of priorities, beyond the marriage and of the constitution of a family,&quot; it explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social norms have contributed to the increase of the number of bachelors women and to delay the marriage and the births, what has a reduction of the birth rate in Singapore as result. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, a policy of immigration aiming at increasing radically the immigration to counter the reduction of the population has created a resentment within the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, one finds sites Web that abounds a xenophobia hardly disguised contrary to the new immigrants, in particular to the Chinese ones that are marked of getting out the salaries to the bottom and of not integrating itself. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase of the immigration also is perceived as one of the reasons why the party puts some in Singapore has experienced the last year his worst electoral results from the independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> From the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the arrangement of quotas and of taxes more raised for the foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Even though the fall of the birth rate has effects known on the economic growth of a country, the fiscal incomes, the sanitary costs and the policies of immigration, the example of Singapore has also unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government tries to avoid the building of numerous small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, that has started affecting the property sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of the urban development have started controlling the number of small apartments, known under the name from &quot;box to shoes&quot;, being able to be built in zones determined from the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and their sale takes away a lot of success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are worried by the fact that they can promote a way of life of bachelor woman and discourage the promoters wishing to build great family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive officer of the property society EL Developers, maintains that his &quot;boxes at shoes&quot; are sold much more in a fast way than the greater accommodations. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense where these accommodations are built well more rapidly than those of greater size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is well more profitable for our funds. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new norms give clearer instructions to the promoters, to who one put beforehand sticks in the wheels if they wished to propose too many small accommodations in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-State. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If so much is that this règlementations news can be a step to the increase of the national birth rate, discussing with the Singaporeans who work financier of the center in the area, it would seem that they are not going to have many effects. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are very stressed out, the houses are expensive, all as the education, it is for that that the people replaces it to more late&quot;, declares a young frame. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and of my time&quot;, declares us another teenager of twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The men and the women mention their career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property and of the education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government tries to persuade his citizens to have children, when it is a matter of making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is offline private sector is online private sector </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality </seg>
<seg id="2644"> In accordance with the Dictionary of the Academy Royal Spanish, it is a matter of the quality of the private domain or &quot;the domain of the life private that we can provide protection from every intrusion&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they have associated the term &quot;something very personal&quot; on the personal plan and &quot;the password and the user name&quot; while they have it applied to the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> &quot;I will not unveil my most personal secrets in one post&quot;, asserts Jorge, ten years, while he tries to explain the meaning of the term deprived on sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it possesses an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> &quot;They are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everybody&quot;, it asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On FB, I post nice pictures or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I discuss also with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;I will not share an of my photos or of somebody that would be the fool&quot;, it says. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The young reconnait boy that it is badly of publishing obscene photos, of bare people, of crimes or of writing comments humiliating or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge assures that it experiences his 35 friends on FB as his nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are of the family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> His mother is part, it experiences the password of one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I have opened an account Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I do not know if they reply to me, I post them simply&quot;, it adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;The social networks are amusing, I can speak with far parents or with my friends, in a fast way,&quot; it says. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He maintains that he would never accept the request for an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Neither he will not trust to somebody that would recommend him a foreign country. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of José, 14 years, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The adolescent possesses accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, thereon last, he admits not to experience 20 of the people noted down on his list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;That does not worry me because we have something in common, the music for example&quot;, it declares. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the young boy, nobody has made him advances nor has asked him for his address or his telephone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;If they put me the pressure or required it, I would remove them simply from my account&quot;, it recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José has subscribed to Ask after having read a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that one knows today under the name of cyberharassment are not foreigners to the young boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A close relation of one of my friends has been racketeered on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They have threatened it and have required money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;Never he has known who it was&quot; it assures. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, has not closed his account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He has only spent it in deprived profile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> It explains afterwards a series of handlings to us to configure his account in a sure way. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this teenager would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would make it if I was angered or irritated. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Even if I know that it is cyberharassment&quot;, it asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Questions keys </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, teacher of English and graduate in Education and Apprenticeship, considers that, to direct the children and the adolescents, one must understand that the goal of the social networks is of informing. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has arises as a means of looking for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game&quot; has &quot;changed&quot;, she mentions. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras notifies that the academician Marc Prensky, who possesses a master in pedagogy of the university of numeric Yale and author of the book &quot;Native and immigrated&quot;, uses these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The numeric natives, they are them, the children and the youths that have been born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;Us, we are the numeric immigrants that owe there to teach to them, even though we are ourselves at learning&quot;, it says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> It adds that the theme is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have a criterion defined on what it suits or not to divulge, to publish or to say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to make it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;We ask to them also to be selective then that what they care about the most is of being popular, of having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences&quot; it adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the specialist, the most efficient way of teaching the children and the adolescents the confidentiality is of using questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell them not to make it does not serve to anything&quot;, it asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Afterwards, Porras enumerates some examples: there are things that you would not tell to a foreign country, why you make it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, that would please you that they publish a photo of you as that of a friend that you have published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identify photos of parties, do you ask the other people for the permission of identifying them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, everybody needs to know what you make at every instant? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is of their to make to understand that they must act online as they make it offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> It is the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet, each must act with respect, morality and of other principles, that must be similar on the social networks&quot;, it asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, teacher of university, primary teacher and adviser of education, declares that it is essential that the parents read the conditions of use of the social networks conscientiously. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Understanding each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss involvements of the opening of an account on Internet with their children. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age and what it is allowed of sharing or of publishing&quot;, it says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, reminding the children that one must not talk to the foreigners is essential. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of the Unasur has ended without the Declaration of Lima being made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The VI presidential summit of the Union of the sud-américaines nations (Unasur) has ended today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima having been made public, although it has been announced previously and she has theoretically been adopted by the 7 present representatives. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe has tried on several occasions to reach the document signed during the VI Ordinary Meeting of the leaders of States and of government of the Unasur, but the ministry of the foreign Businesses and the presidency have notified to the departure that it would be divulged after the fence of the summit, then have asserted that it would be published of a moment to the other one on the Internet site of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> While they have been questioned about the text, they have notified that his contents had been displayed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief declarations at the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The access of the journalists to the information regarding the summit has constantly been limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> For the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;session private, audio restricted&quot; was diffused in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few information that circulated between the journalists have been those given by the press attachés of some of the governments of the Unasur that attended the appointment, except for the Peruvian spokesperson. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The unique document divulged during the day has been the list of the present presidents, what has caused some uneasiness among the hundred journalists of diverse national and international media that asked for more important information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it was a matter of the speech of the president Humala and not of the official document that has concluded the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> In last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd South America-Country summit Arabic (ASPA) and, à cette occasion, although that has been asked for with authority by the press, it had not broadcast either the declaration called also Declaration of Lima, as that had previously been announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official site of the ASPA, one can check that the document has been published at the month of last March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international appointments, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up sure systems of transmission for all the journalists, but they have limited the obtainment of information to the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit is also concluded itself with the linked agreement of Chile and of the Peru of accepting a sentence of the Court of The Hague that cuts a different frontier between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, have met during the appointment regional and have declared that they would respect the decision of the CIJ of hearing the pleas of the two parts in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will respect and will carry out the verdict that will solve the disagreements that we carry today in front of this international court&quot;, has declared the president Humala, to the side of his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has always been, and will continue be a country respectful with the international right, of the pacific resolution of the controversies, of the treaties and from the international courts&quot;, will have added the president Piñera giving the president Humala a handclasp, beside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they would subject themselves to the CIJ has taken place after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which she had accepted to subject itself to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with the Nicaragua that she considered as seriously erroneous. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit has been held without the presence of the presidents of the Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended of the Unasur for 2011 after the dismissal of his ex-president Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the appointment. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host president, Ollanta Humala, has been responsible to open the deliberations the morning and to clore the summit little after midday in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The representative has read the final document in which it has announced that 16 agreements had adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the sud-américains countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the adopted agreements, he has mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would set up &quot;important moves to reach the goal of the sud-américaine citizenship by the development of agreements on the licenses of stay&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He has informed that actions would be set up to improve the &quot;cooperation in the fight against the urban insecurity and against the international organized crime, of the actions for a better accessibility to the medicines, the access to the Internet down price in the whole of South America, and to evaluate in a linked and efficient way risk them of natural disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic strengthening (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to anticipate to a future better for our populations&quot;, has ended up the president Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to favor a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, in particular in the rural and frontier zones... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits&quot;, has declared the president Peruvian during a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he has mentioned that five concerned Peru and found themselves on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast up to Brazil, and that two aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador well that it has not given roomiest details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We expect that the electoral process of this country will allow his reinstatement within the Union from the sud-américaines Nations&quot;, from which it is presently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The necessity that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and of peace, integrated and having good relationships with his neighbors, is another theme approached during the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, has declared, before beginning the regional appointment, that he expected from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to meet his counterpart on the Saturday following in Mexico City to discuss quietly of the maritime disagreement through of a sentence of the CIJ asked for by Bogotá. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with the president Daniel Ortega&quot;, has declared the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with the Nicaragua that is going to ask to have a discussion with this country&quot;, it has underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to tell to the president Ortega that we are going to settle that in the way the possible most civilized and respectful one&quot;, has added the president Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they have planned to attend the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> In the same way, within the framework of the summit, the Defense Secretaries of the block will meet preliminarily to approve of the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which tries to reinforce the dialog and the consensus in terms of defense in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although this last country is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru assures the presidency pro tempore from the regional block. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship&quot;, declares Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has maintained today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which &quot;South America, in that case, had to take example on Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The president Correa, who has participated in the VI summit of the Union of the sud-américaines Nations (Unasur), situated in Lima, has declared on television of State, TV Péru, which the Europeans &quot;had killed themselves during the Second World War&quot; and during other conflicts, &quot;but that they formed now practically a homeland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, it has defended the project of establishing a sud-américaine citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;One must get to the free circulation of the citizens and of the workers in any sud-américain country, as it is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but it remains still reactionary domains which we want to make belong to the past&quot; it has warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Moreover, the Ecuadorian president has shown itself in favor of the reformation American States Organization (OEA) with the objective of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and of taking into account the signatories of the pact of San José on the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those that reshuffle us the ears do not compromise themselves never nothing, conversely, us, the sud-américains ones, he have everyone signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the inter-American Commission of the human rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States&quot;, it has asserted, referring to the political home granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because it has not shone-even betrayed step his principles, but on the contrary it has respected his &quot;deep values democratic and of the human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> It has concluded that at that time, there were founded suspicions according to which Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial&quot; would not be &quot;respected&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Furthermore, he criticizes the Swedish justice that has required that it subjects itself to a cross-examination on his territory regarding a sexual offense presumed then that &quot;the own Swedish legislation allows making it by videoconference, what could be made from the embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa has maintained that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not talked to him since it is in our embassy, but the ambassadress has informed me that it had a small lung problem, but nothing serious&quot;, has asserted the Ecuadorian president. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by the fact of being closed in in a small space without being able to make of exercises to the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That acts on the health of anybody&quot;, it concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa notifies that the solution of home agreed to Assange since the month of June in the Ecuadorian embassy of London, which would be the attribution of a safe-conduct that would allow him to go in Ecuador, is between the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of the European judicial authorities and underlines that it has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with the human rights, we do not use this word in that case, but there have been permanent discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, of Sweden and of the European judicial authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of procedures next to different European authorities&quot;, he has mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he thinks that if Great Britain granted the safe-conduct from tomorrow, that would end. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as allows it totally his legislation, and as it has already made it in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned it via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be also resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa has taken advantage of it to be reaffirmed as defender of the freedom of the press and it has clarified that what it did not tolerate was &quot;the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that harm the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the malevolent or wicked politicians but the bad journalists to the balance of the eagerness, of the blackmail and of the extortion,&quot; it has declared. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Under this corner, he has congratulated that that is not&quot; this kind of journalists or the bankers or the hégémoniques and middle-class countries that dominate in Ecuador and, rather only of putting forward his re-election, &quot;it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and to draw the domestic sees&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also has supported the decision of maintaining the vet on Paraguay within the Unasur at least up to the next elections, arguing that the organism &quot;had to appear firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and the disguised putsch attempts&quot;, because in reality, &quot;that destroyed the legitimity of the Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as &quot;perfectly pertinent&quot; the desire for his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, of negotiating the maritime limits with Nicaragua between the two countries by the device of the sentence of the international Court of The Hague, what will reinforce the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the time being, this sentence is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a sud-américain country and a centraméricain country. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be exceeded by the will of bringing forward unity. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be solved in their unity to exceed them and to go from the front. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> In the same time, he has told to itself confident in the good resolution of the dispute regarding the maritime borders that opposes Peru and Chile within the same court and he has maintained that it is &quot;beneficial that Latin America seizes the international authorities if the two countries match to accept&quot; a so firm sentence &quot;that it is&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With reference to the possibility of his presentation as candidate for the presidential future elections in Ecuador, with a view to aspiring to a third consecutive mandate, it has notified that he saw this possibility &quot;with a lot of optimism and joy, although that is sometimes difficult&quot; enough. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa has assured that, if it lost the primary ones of February 2013, it would withdraw from the public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> At the personal level, the power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can decide only by the device of the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement has believed that it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility&quot;, it has asserted. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I won, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will withdraw afterwards from the life talk about politics. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we ever lose, I will make it also. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is my decision&quot;, it has asserted. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa has also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just discussed Nicolás Maduro with the Venezuelan vice-president and he has told me that a medical treatment of routine was already planned and that it waited for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;That does not mean a relapse of the state of health of the president Chávez&quot;, he has commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian head of state has participated today in Lima at the VI summit of the heads of state and of government of the Union of the sud-américaines Nations (Unasur) that has ended with a call to a better regional integration in order to support the progress, the equality and the safety. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The deaths related to Aids are today owed to a late detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio had 21 years while one has confirmed him the result of the test: seropositive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It is as if the sky had fallen me on the head&quot;, it says referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to give back &quot;less hard&quot;, in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man has hidden it to his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He has decided to load alone of his illness and has started informing itself to his subject and his determination has been such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, undoubtedly, one of the most previous patients of the unity of the HIV of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he has found itself in 1994 after numerous battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio saw immunodeficiency human with the virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the years 90, where there were many doubts, little of choice of treatment and more scars. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Then, even the manager of a clinic of the IMSS avoided telling goodbye to him &quot;because it was without voice&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In that time, to have Aids was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible of surviving this syndrome and of having a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their illness, numerous people arrive still while the virus has already caused damages, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and are victims of opportunist infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the appearance of the Aids in the world, in all the cases after the first signal cases, &quot;the great victory is today that the survival of a patient having begun a treatment at the timely moment and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same one&quot;, has indicated the leader of the unity of the HIV of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologue and expert in HIV/Aids, Andrade Villanueva, has commented that for 2008, the scientists have concluded that Aids was not a mortal illness anymore, but only the number of years of survival and the quality of life depended of the level of allocation of the immune system that the patients presented to the moment of the diagnosis, with better perspectives for those not consuming drugs: until 30 years for a rate of CD4 of 200 and until 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply to speak, that means that for somebody that would receive an HIV diagnosis positive at 25 years, &quot;as long as it will remain under control, will be able to live without problems until 75 years&quot;, has explained the questioned scientist. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to replace this progress in his context, it must be known that the life expectancy of the Mexican ones is today of 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> S it is true that the mortality has reduced in a significant way these last years, in the case of Mexico, the number of dead people of the continuations of Aids has passed of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the relation annual of ONUSIDA), but it is also truth that, from the appearance of Aids, 60% of the patients counted on the data base national are dead. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Nothing that to Jalisco, 255 people are dead in 2011, and there have been 187 dead men persons until in May of this year; however, one assures us that the access to the antirétroviraux medicines is universal for 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Then why there are still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that the problem does not come from the access to the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> It is like that that I see it, it is what has happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Towards the 12 last years at least, never we have lacked medicines, the problem is that the patients arrive to stadiums very brought forward because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it to advanced stadiums of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives an indisputable fact to us &quot;nine patients on ten arrive even though they present already an opportunist infection, it that is needed to have a greater impact on the global mortality, is to realize more precocious diagnoses and, for that, tests of detection in a massive way must be proposed, to all the people who ask for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> The specialists and the members of the Council of State of prevention of the Aids of Jalisco (Coesida) match on his suggestion, as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, that has of the to make his test of detection in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had made it and that, in spite of his young age, he was already an AIDS carrier and suffered from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the ordinary complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Every exchange while you learn that you have Aids. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I am going to die, it is worth better that I burst me three times a week&quot;, they say, it is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I make exercise, I take my medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> At this day, his parents know that he suffers from a cancer only. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, as anybody of other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but coresponsible, I mind me and to the other person&quot;, tells Fabrizio, who has accepted to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those that are afraid today, during the walk of the World Day against Aids. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> That they make the test, if they have seized by the risks, more they will know early if they are seropositive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know than one can live as everybody, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against Aids in this year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are numerous ditches between the programs of health and the ordinary citizen, it supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara that has embraced the cause of the HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the greatest resides in the prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all the places dedicated thereto, &quot;indeed &quot;one has increased the distribution of the condoms, before one gave one to us or two, now one gives packets of a hundred to us, it is very well, but it results from it, that today still, some do not have access to the condoms&quot;, it asserts. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to the new infections, one meets the adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: &quot;That you are going to make&quot;&quot;? put with sarcasm and sentences of value by the social workers, the advisers of direction, the pharmacists and the professionals of health, is the question that the adolescents do not have desire of hearing, insures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> It offers to redirect this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only sold at the counters, but that one finds them in the distributors of the public bathroom and in the places that the youths frequent. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It is not a matter of encouraging the overcrowding. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Neither it is not a matter of paying them the girls and the motel, as the governor Emilio González had replied while one had asked him if a distribution of the condoms would be within his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It is not&quot; like that &quot;that works the sexuality, the better is of supplying condoms to the already active people sexually&quot;, it has underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The numbers at Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> One counts 13.435 cases accumulated (12.158 of Aids and 1.317 of the HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The State is the 4th State of the country in a number of the new cases and accumulated cases of Aids and 13th for the number of the patients of the HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of the contaminations make by sees sexual, 6% by sees hothead and 2% by sees perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> One considers that 50.000 people live with the HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> A sentence ratified in call by a court of the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the group Vitro consented via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The script causes a harmful precedent for all the national societies possessing ramifications in the country neighbors and having problems of solvency. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> One would say therefore that the procedures of survival of the societies allowed to by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the banner starred, at counterfoot of the international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> Of a practical viewpoint, the blow carried to the sentence given back on last June 15th by the judge Harlin Hale de la Cour of the bankruptcies for the north district of Texas, leaves the Mexican societies without defense in view of the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution is going to allow the main manufacturer of glass of Mexico to seize the High Court of the United States relying on three incoherences. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, even though the judge of the cause signals that the creditors must be recorded according to the law on the bankruptcies of the United States, the court of call of the fifth circuit, sitting to the Nouvelle-Orléans, maintains that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would imply of denouncing the cooperation of international procedure in the cases of insolvency of firms having a transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the Model law of the United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial Law had been created at this end taking the American Law Institute as referee. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> In second place, the sentence establishes that without the vote intersocieties, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro to the mother society, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been able to be obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There is a half-a-doz of examples here, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Institute Fédéral des Faillites Commerciales had guarantees the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Moreover, what is certain is that, since it remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in all the ways the creditors of Vitro that has fought against that in the courts of the United States, in other words the funds &quot;vulture&quot; as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would have been of 45 voice against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A datum omitted by the court of call. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Of another side, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation that it met for 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, echoing the costs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the Moment, the society of the family González Sada will lodge call in front of the same court of call so that the vote takes place in his whole, in other words with the five magistrates, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The resort of assurance will ask for the non-prosperity and requires the review of the trial by a superior authority, in that case the High Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The more engraves is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;) in which the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on the bankruptcies was detailed commercial, notifying that that freed it from the conventions signed by the two countries to take it to the even level that the paragraph 15 of the law on the bankruptcies of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Furthermore, it notifies that the country has submitted to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations regarding the International Business, in other words the rules set for the cases of insolvency cross-border, that guaranteed the equity for the debtors and the creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Pile-up of two parts: they stun Vitro and they stun the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General assessment </seg>

<seg id="2852"> The funds would have been used for the purchase of Professional actions of the Administration of the Hotels. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes &quot;The basket-ball is all my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotter of the basket-ball &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has passed more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, thanks to it, has traveled in the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few from people to Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basket-ball as great as that of Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage sentences it to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, which that is as player of inferior leagues, player of the national team of basket-ball, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the federation of basket-ball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have carried several caps in the basket-ball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, how when I was a president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the federation for the years 90&quot;, remember Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his place at Bayamón, that it resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;The basket-ball is all my life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes does not exaggerate when it makes this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, nearly everyone decorated with photos and with memories that remind his route apart from norms, reveal it. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Of all his memories, those that it loves the most are those that remind him his passage as player within the team of the Vaqueros in the middle of the years 50 up to 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> That has been my best years, those of which I have the most benefited because I have had the luck of participating in eight championships of the Vaqueros from 1967, that it is than manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Many years of satisfaction ago, including the five championships argued of 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I have retired afterwards during the championship in 1981, the year that Jerome Mincy has entered to the team of the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there,&quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has taken the head of the team&quot;, indicates Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and who was to the University of Alabama (Birmingham), has called me: &quot;I have a sturdy player for you, it measures two meters. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want it&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It is like that that to begin Mincy, one of the best players that has had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow has recommended me afterwards Raymond Gausse, which has been naturalized and who was one of better gunmen. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that it said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to take away a championship, Mocks us was going to help to try to take away one other. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> It is itself looks forward of the championship of the Vaqueros with Mocks, but only to distance since in 1988 it was already the great manitou of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In that time, it preferred to benefit of the his loads and of those of Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we have taken it away for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament of Mexico City in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Afterwards, there has been that World of 1990, where we have arrived 4th and where we should have taken away the medal of bronze if this Canadian judge had not made to us to replay the last match, has declared Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Is the team of that World of 1990 the best national team that you have seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is part of the best, all as the one that has beaten the Dream Team during the Olympic Games of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite is that of the Pan-American Games of Cuba in 1991, while we have taken away the gold and that we have put a hiding to the team of the United States, which was similar enough to the one that had taken away the bronze during that World. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team was not only composed of Mincy, Mocks, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), there were the youths (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; also Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Moral Mario &quot;Quijote&quot;, who had not been able to attend that world of 90 because of a problem of knees. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that maybe was not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given a gold medal and a great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina to us. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of the players suspended by the mess of the Pan-American Games of Mar del Plata, we have taken away the gold against all the forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who has been the best player of Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Undoubtedly, it is a matter of Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His statistics as regards the international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín has made it. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that without setting counts his path in the different leagues for which it has worked. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who has been the best portoricain leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to statement. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We have had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In the youths, I like much the work that Leo Arill does. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your greatest success within the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> To have been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the one makes that at the beginning of the years 1990, the BSN counted up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What does he remain you to make? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things which I would have wanted to set up, as the regionalization of the minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example that the boys of Ponce play only in their zone and face only teams of the other corners of the island during the national play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, the youths travel and work too much even though that is not inevitably necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least seen the advantage of the compulsory certifications and of the lessons for the leaders, the staff of ground and the referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> That makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you make today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I take advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend matches of basket-ball. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, that has always been at my sides. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Death of the actor Larry Hagman </seg>

<seg id="2924"> It brought the joy to all those that experienced it. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I am much going to miss it. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> &quot;She was a person of exception and he lived the life thoroughly&quot;, has declared Gray in a communiqué. </seg>

<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the deliciously appalling one J. R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of the chain CBS on the clan Ewing and their close relations has been broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan &quot;that has killed J.R.&quot;?, invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is practically murdered, has generated speculations in the whole world and millions of dollars played in bets. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to that, among others, the series has reached a record of audience at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> While the reply has been revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and have made the second program of diversion from &quot;Dallas&quot; the more looked at in the world, after the final episode of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983, which had rallied 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) that had pulled it top. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J. R. had taken it pregnant and afterwards had threatened it of accusing it of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people had also reasons of attacking it. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupted and insatiable man but to the charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who tried to make his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) intern. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;I know what R would be needed as epitaph for J.&quot;, has declared Hagman in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> One should write: &quot;Ci-gît the honest J. citizen R. Ewing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> These are is you are the unique part that it has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Main, coprotagonist of the original series, has remembered this Friday of Hagman as of one man &quot;immense, on the small screen as well as in the life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans across the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the luck of experiencing it and of loving it. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were broadcast some months ago with a great success on the chain TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The recording of five episodes already is finished for the second season and one sixth is in the process of realization, has informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For the Moment, neither the Warner nor the chain TNT have communicated on the way in which the death of Hagman in the series will be integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Originating from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the celebrity with classical works as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2960"> A lesson dealing with the &quot;end of the world&quot; has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Every week, the students explore apocalyptic themes as the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and the climatic reheating. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, while the teacher of religion Stuart Charmé has decided to give a lesson towards the end of the world, he knew that it threw an irresistible hook there: the end of the &quot;great deduction&quot; of the Maya calendar, on December 21st, to which refer of numerous people as being the proof of the end of the world imminent. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But the teacher Charmé did not have any idea of what waited for it in the course of the next months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, one fiscal abyss that some have nicknamed &quot;the Armageddon of the debt&quot; and an increasing conflict implying Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times thought that the apocalypse would go off. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I have not realized that that was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that I have never known,&quot; has declared this week the teacher Charmé to his students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If one analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we tell it, that has been a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And one must remember that what is bad is good for those that believe in the apocalypse. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only teacher to give classes towards &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, which will be, in theory, the latter of the history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> In Temple, the teacher assigned Barry Vacker dispenses the lesson &quot;Media, culture and end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Every week, the students explore apocalyptic themes as the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and the climatic reheating. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze that because these ideas proliferate with the time&quot;, it has declared, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scripts guides some human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear armament fell in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could burst. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students will analyze films having apocalyptic themes and will study how they can be compared with examples of the real life. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I have tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossibleness&quot;, has declared Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the teacher of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and her colleague Amara Solari, an adjointe professeure of History of the Art and of Anthropology, have been team to give a lesson, simply titled &quot;The end of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We add &quot;2012&quot; to have the possibility of giving the lesson again, if the world not disparaitrait not&quot;, has declared the teacher Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> In spite of the &quot;imminent disaster&quot;, the students must study, create projects and pass their final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will have passed the day before of the Apocalypse, what does not leave to the student of other choice only of working &quot;until the night even of the end of the world required&quot;, has declared Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The lessons have revealed themselves popular enough. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;It has been complete in two hours&quot;, has asserted Restall about his lesson intended to the students of high level, compound of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, on behalf of people who asked if there was still place. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, for their part, assure that the lesson is one of the most interesting. </seg>
