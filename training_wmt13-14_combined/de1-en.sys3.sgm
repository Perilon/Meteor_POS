<seg id="100"> The winner receives $250,000 to continue its work. </seg>
<seg id="101"> 21 years, Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him. </seg>

<seg id="103"> First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation, which to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="104"> &quot;There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="105"> We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="107"> &quot;It is not easy,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="108"> You can leave the house at five o &quot;clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one, and it is not first. </seg>
<seg id="109"> There are very many patients. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Indeed, some people die because they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="113"> In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people. </seg>

<seg id="115"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private. </seg>
<seg id="116"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="118"> His father, and so many of his countrymen to see suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it. </seg>

<seg id="122"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need help. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Not everything runs smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="125"> More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="126"> But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration. </seg>
<seg id="128"> The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="129"> &quot;We treat 500 people per trip,&quot; Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="130"> You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village and on foot. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Each of these weekend clinics offering medical care in a number of areas. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic. </seg>
<seg id="135"> The operations are normally held in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team. </seg>
<seg id="138"> &quot;They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has carried out last year, 700 free operations and know that it makes an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them. </seg>
<seg id="141"> A man explained that the free operation of that he had received enabled him to return to work. </seg>
<seg id="142"> &quot;The changes the future of my family,&quot; the man said. </seg>
<seg id="143"> In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="144"> With this second job he finanziere 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations. </seg>
<seg id="145"> &quot;I really do not know when he is asleep,&quot; says Katie O &quot;Malley, who for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group. </seg>
<seg id="146"> He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medical and nursing students such as O &quot;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explains O &apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often donated medical equipment. </seg>
<seg id="151"> But they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide. </seg>
<seg id="152"> &quot;He is undoubtedly a hero,&quot; says O &quot;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries. </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="156"> &quot;I am so happy when I make this work,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I am thinking of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope he sees what I do. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain. </seg>

<seg id="161"> Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="162"> Pope Francis will be for the first time on 22 February appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Cardinals are the most senior cleric in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Currently, there are 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="165"> However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, no longer take part in the papal election - which is a group of 120 &quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="166"> In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="167"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February. </seg>
<seg id="169"> He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of voting cardinals 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, in order to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In the past, the Pope decided everything alone. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Francis has selected eight cardinals who will help him,&quot; said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice. </seg>
<seg id="178"> But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to Cardinals, but Francis was &quot;full of surprises, so we do not know whom he appoints.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="185"> Europe&apos;s elite is ready to do business with the United Kingdom? </seg>
<seg id="186"> Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain, want to change our relations with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="187"> To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="188"> YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, the British company sizes, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="190"> We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries to modernize and grow, while the states in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="191"> that the government of new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured, rather than with the long and arduous process, the obscure to reform EU institutions. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Asked about their views on specific legal issues, from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of the business leaders of the opinion that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="193"> There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company in the cost of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe&apos;s trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the, which are traditionally the most Europhile. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, not politics. </seg>
<seg id="195"> This realization that is used in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change,&quot; which brings the tiller back to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="196"> It is about much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 percent would lead to a change of view in favor of the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK&apos;s conditions for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="198"> It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation. </seg>

<seg id="579"> Now is the accusation, Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land after the Tripodis former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="580"> In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer maturities. </seg>
<seg id="582"> In 2009, the leases for the company at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had previously argued for public tenders. </seg>

<seg id="590"> NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance </seg>
<seg id="591"> On a balmy day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="592"> On the instructions of the Federal Office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="593"> According to German media wanted the BAT antennas to prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="594"> James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, was again in September that the U.S. no possibilities of foreign espionage, &quot;in order to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could strengthen their international competitiveness or their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="595"> But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower&apos;s former employees, began with the publication of his US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company&apos;s paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak. </seg>

<seg id="601"> &quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; says Oliver Green, president of the BITMi, small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="602"> German companies believe that the United States now almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities, and they should reduce their dependence on the United States. </seg>

<seg id="610"> Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal on cars to agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Everything, except for the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked companies, which had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The cloud computing is a big change, because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk. </seg>

<seg id="615"> Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says: &quot;We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago, it is: Where my data will be stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this area?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="616"> Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="617"> That economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="618"> This has always been the case. </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do that, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>

<seg id="625"> The prepaid phones are thrown away. </seg>
<seg id="626"> However, there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="627"> In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their respective niche. </seg>
<seg id="628"> &quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access,&quot; warns the BAT in a report. </seg>

<seg id="977"> Under the direction of Hermann Schneider is accompanied by the Choir of the brass band of the Musikverein gladness Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the of a dog with his mood. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left side in nervous dogs. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, we have tried to look at this in other species. </seg>
<seg id="983"> He also noted that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> To learn more about how dogs on the side of their, the researchers monitored the animals, while saw these films of other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="985"> They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> We will soon understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="988"> If the animals looked like an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they remained completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="989"> But it was the tail to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wag), their increased heart rate and they looked restless. </seg>
<seg id="990"> According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience that movements they should worry or not. </seg>
<seg id="992"> He said: &quot;If you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is associated with friendly behavior and the right side, a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal. </seg>
<seg id="994"> John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada: &quot;Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog, if his tail wag on the left and the right not to be restless, rather than the other way around, as in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to his testimony, the differences could stir, therefore, that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said. </seg>
<seg id="999"> &quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined, and dogs are no exception,&quot; said Bradshaw. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Since their behavior record, but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one, sometimes in the opposite direction. </seg>

<seg id="1211"> The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people. </seg>

<seg id="1249"> Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year, the Kinzigtal-rail route. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> In particular, to increase the safety at railway crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> The communities, they need to be involved with one third of the cost, the rest divided and. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the specifics of the council Bahübergangs &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There, the city plans to build the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a bulge. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> There could also carry bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, oncoming traffic, without blocking the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the subsequent street at the time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This has been controversial in the municipal council, as some councils, the need for road expansion in doubt: Thomas Kipp, saying the mood of the critics: &quot;We have to because so few vehicles so much money?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing &quot;Hirschen will regularly used for. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even wood from the area &quot;Kuhbach&quot; will be transported via this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke there, because they could not turn on the main street. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> It is that they would have to be rebuilt and renovated mountain and Schlossberg tunnel, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing &quot;On&quot; deer &quot;for a longer period of time an important traffic. </seg>

<seg id="1263"> The reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein could lead to a different problem, which access to the &quot;Geroltzhäuser way.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The administration had Breinlinger examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering firm, because they had doubts as to whether the planned end of the Geroltzhäuser route is still possible. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation concluded that it is that the tendency of the road conditions could lead to longer vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Responsibility for this, in turn, the city as a. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The reconstruction could take liability disputes. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Since both the wood collection and turning in the current state of development, we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> It is also the risk of a collision of with a vehicle on the transition of significantly lower than the other railroad crossings, because the in the middle, which is a good view. </seg>

<seg id="1379"> November 1, the organization based in The Hague, Damascus, to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons &quot;or&quot;, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling of ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all Syria&apos;s chemical weapons by mid-2014. </seg>

<seg id="1427"> Coulson, phone-hacking for checking a tips </seg>
<seg id="1428"> The former News of the Word-editor Andy Coulson was supposedly &quot;phone-hacking, monitoring and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World heard in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voice mails, and pursued them, but Coulson called and left messages, such as the court was told. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> &quot;According to the public prosecutor&apos;s office is Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that people are faced with a history to see their reaction,&quot; said Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> He said that NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The publisher is personally involved in the third method. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Obviously he knows of the second, the, it cannot be. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> What about the first? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> He knows about the phone-hacking? </seg>
<seg id="1437"> He denies that, but we say: &quot;And whether he knew about it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Rumors of an affair Clarke&apos;s first feature of the editors of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: &quot;Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A band with voice mail from their phone at least three occasions in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on the Pawlby and her sister were stored as &quot;projects&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> At the time the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voicemail with the following content: &quot;I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1444"> Edis said Coulsons activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, the former Home Secretary David Blunkett. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: Grow up faster </seg>
<seg id="1449"> African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical changes mean not directly puberty </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A mother should be worried if her daughter grow at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> &quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally, this is not a sign that is now fast puberty,&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) in the last 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to the,&quot; said Kaplowitz, author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: The essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Time is the most accurate test, which is progressing puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious,&quot; if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases, the process slowed down or stalled – something that can monitor a pediatrician. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For faster progress could be by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psycho-social aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: &quot;The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter has received with ten days. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Even if there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her group of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Young are similar girls before puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> He supported girls on the implementation of a study in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are different reasons for this. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hairs earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other doctors on the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> &quot;We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should talk to their child. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;This may mean that you have a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If you stay calm, the child is usually good. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Girls who early bloom, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants </seg>

<seg id="1533"> The South stand in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand nothing stirred. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - for. </seg>

<seg id="1569"> If Anna and Benn communicate via GMail about their next holiday travel, Google can display links to holiday purchases. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Also unknown people read the e-mails? </seg>
<seg id="1571"> The likelihood that unauthorized people hear a mail is extremely low. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> In theory, but it is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> In companies often administrators have the ability to mitzulesen electronic mail. </seg>

<seg id="1585"> It is attractive to determine the work and daily. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> With Burfien instructed the country&apos;s church for the first time, a pastor at a place to inspire young people to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: &quot;God&apos;s voice is quiet, the world.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1597"> In sparsely populated peripheral regions such as the resin, Emsland or Wendland could in the future it will be difficult to fill posts. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Burfien wants to hold study days for young people, among other things, and also invite celebrities who have studied theology. </seg>

<seg id="1601"> Hearing before the Royal Commission, charged with two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord accused of sex offences </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> But the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, &quot;in the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he had known of the first case, but the second was not known. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that &quot;there was external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) has received in August of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management &quot;from me downwards&quot; in the recruitment of Lord and to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA at the beginning of the. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that employees have to report violations in relation to the Lords regarding the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, &quot;and most of the time was very remote.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Instead, he said, have affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organisation from the Jonathan Lord incident &quot;, not&quot; affects reporting &quot;by staff, and the board voted to approve him. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations, the managing director of children&apos;s services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but it was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly implemented. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no safe for children, said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> He explained that it had been &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees. </seg>

<seg id="1625"> Some 157 meters of the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> But few visitors who visit the two ornate spires, knowing that there are also under the cathedral to discover a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Meeting point for the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The tour begins very unspectacular: &quot;We start in the garage,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and that is why there was only from the remnants of the old city wall, which was not too big. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most users of the park today therefore rush past the Roman ruins and put their car. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> But if you look closely, discovered in a parking deck D2 separated by metal mesh rods. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> To see about five meters high ruins of handtellergroßen stones. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before it goes back to the surface, Schulze participants on the upper level, a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly noticed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participants climb back down into the depths. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> We are seeing here is the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> What does CCAA, asks a visitor. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;The acronym stands for&quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, &quot;which in English as much as&quot; city of Roman law and the Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of of the altar for the imperial cult &quot;means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> And the Pretorian is the former governor&apos;s palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> From the hall of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman sewer, which is here at around 120 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> &quot;You can go quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want,&quot; Schulze encouraging guests. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> A surprise Schulze has. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> After he took the key at the box office, he leads the group with a 16 meters deep shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> &quot;We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground, in order to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washing. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> To date, at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine. </seg>

<seg id="1659"> George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new horror story to independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> In fact, it was in the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - played no role in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is convenient for them. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> That is not really a story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And one that is already happened in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The, the first time I have heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; duck at least 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> This is an interesting point in the constant refrain of this ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU or the euro as a common currency to throw overboard. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, and distribute effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The current economic crisis, it is a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in connection with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits - that was the case in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like to. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency will take place in southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a result of the imposed by Brussels &quot;green&quot; energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election and the ruling Socialists in three. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What makes Le Pen, with their newly gained popularity among the white working-class French? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come to the abolition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the &quot;Europe&quot; (sovereign) nations favored General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from the project, hoping to curry favour with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> However, Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where is Scotland in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can decide to be a region of (ultimately). </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I suspect that Scotland could go in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations easier. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed by Berlin and Brussels austerity. </seg>

<seg id="1709"> But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The airlines need to prove that the FAA aircraft to meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices, according to the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA said that she had already received by some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Under these airlines were Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> &quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA announced in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> At the entrance to the, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again, before the plane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions could allow its passengers to use the devices, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> &quot;If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline, both sides will benefit from it,&quot; said Glading. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> We are to be honest, we feel like watchdogs on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained. </seg>

<seg id="1726"> And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still seen as a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer from the air,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCas kill from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> In some studies, up to one-third of the passengers, the closure of the device or ignored. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communications equipment of passengers bears FM radios were, the latest technology trend. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Today&apos;s electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you umblättert. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> But when downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices use by passengers is Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> In 2011, invited an airliner full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who did speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would be equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that it is not a pleasant passenger experience is to safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: No absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want to involve the people at an early stage in the planning,&quot; Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> About 80 participants had come into the town hall to explain the measures planned to ask questions to express concerns and ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Häußler was clear: &quot;The ultimate decisions, the members of the municipal council.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The flooding that Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a crucial event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring village of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;The protection of cultivated land is the goal,&quot; says Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> The planning the protection against a of, according to the German weather service statistically every 100 years expected flooding. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Climate change is a 15-percent surcharge. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> In expert circles, this is &quot;HQ 100a climate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The floods had considerable damage in 2009 Gechingen corresponded to a 1000 -year flood. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,&quot; says Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, must be invested in Gechingen around four million euros, with the municipality can land grants amounting to around 70 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> But Häußler pointed out that there is the promotion only if an overall concept. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> An elaborate planning and approval procedures should be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> In the best case, could be started in 2016 with the implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Among other things, for the protection of concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council) local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Among other things, has been called into question, why not more dams and reservoirs are planned for the protection of the site. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms forest and Corbe from hill, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Moreover, it is to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> There was anger in countries bordering the Altorts who suffer even in normal thunderstorm rain storm again under an overload of the canal network. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems other than for flood protection and should not be mixed. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The community is obliged to interpret the canal network so that could be two to three-year rain events. </seg>

<seg id="1825"> As Déjà Vu is according to a psychological phenomenon, which is to have the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> In the case of the visit of the cafes in the town of Opschlag Kleve in sight Rhine-Waal must not remain in the pure sense of déjà vu. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> After all, the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the: A real stay not only intellectually, but hand repeatedly. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Because it&apos;s fun and is simply beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A look into the inner workings of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer to feel good. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> The ultra-modern, but not cool cafe atmosphere looks like a place to relax. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> There&apos;s delicious cakes or individually fresh baguettes. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Last but not least, by the university. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> &quot;We do not have a specific target group,&quot; said Daniel Buettner. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Instead, the two young students would like to raise as much as seniors and all ages in between. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> Speaking of coffee lovers. </seg>

<seg id="1843"> &quot;A baguette - that is my thing,&quot; she tells the NRZ. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Two events were also in the bright cafe. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> Rather one. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Because the port was more out there - the Café Déjà Vu benefited from it. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> But there was also the Ringelnatzabend. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> &quot;Beautiful, successful and funny,&quot; found the two 33-year-olds. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> But not everyone&apos;s thing. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Daniel Buettner is also not a great fan of event evenings: &quot;it is not all right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> And with an event, I always speak only those who are interested in the special event. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> That is why events will be the exception rather than the. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders on seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The dispute revolves around the seat width, passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should be decided by. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> As the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that, which is to deliver the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; design. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing claims its modernized &quot;777X&quot; take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, there are nine per series. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Recently, the company has an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;Would you accept that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft,&quot; says Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> In the light of changed eating habits are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized &quot;jet Set&quot; was narrow. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> It was, as Airbus, that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing disputes the figures Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The company also explains, according to the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> &quot;It is really boils down to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful,&quot; explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers, there is more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the US or Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Boeing&apos;s statements on the results depend in part on the the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The world-travelling jet sellers even tape measure, the establishment of the competition. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own account. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Veganism is the vegetarianism, differs from this, but in a very significant way. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> While vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products, including honey is denied. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world through a considerable ingenuity. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Sandwich spreads are very popular,&quot; said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan, he finds in (almost) everything he needs to live. &quot;In 1997, I asked my diet and became a vegetarian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1903"> At the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice,&quot; says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> He acknowledged that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> First and foremost is his vegan ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I do not want to see animals must die for me,&quot; says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, I have discovered a new products, the enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;It is a double bonus,&quot; says Proctor today, &quot;in fact, vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the man with the selection of dining options, Proctor leads on the power of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to smoking,&quot; Proctor is a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> And: &quot;Certain tastes are not on the animal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,&quot; the vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> At a barbecue Proctor, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> He is supposed to a balanced and varied diet, the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It should taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that, he had not suffered. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> For me, the change has had a positive aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I am no stranger to cholesterol and have a higher vitamin. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;My blood values are well, I am often check,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;Because animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 share is high,&quot; Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B12 values are in order,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Proctor must not go for food procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Everything I need, I find on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> And I buy something special. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive, but that is the&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1933"> In any case, the preparation of our dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This dynamic, when you cook together, has a new significance. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> He was, of course, but also scepticism. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> You enjoy my food? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> &quot;I feel bad because I drank milk?&quot; - of this kind must be as vegans with tact. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would not enclaves. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And the everyday world seems to be not so vegan as - and not the in everyday life, as is commonly believed. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Even fast food is allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> There are everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many Döner offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit. </seg>

<seg id="1975"> Before tests on humans will be needed before tests, which can take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; said Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus infected selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine. </seg>

<seg id="1984"> The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories. </seg>

<seg id="2029"> Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars to demand from passengers on their flight hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Frontier said it charged 25 if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O &apos;Malley said, the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in the payment. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> &quot;We do not want to charge this amount,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> O &apos;Malley said, the new fee, it is not really trying to make money. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O &apos;Malley said, the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, an exact date is not yet. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers often grumbled about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to fall back on. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> But so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first charges for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the additional charges. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee Spirit $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> &quot;The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have seen in my career in aviation,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> &quot;The plane was full,&quot; he said, &quot;and the boarding as lubricated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Frontier spirit is also the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, would keep the whole box and will be free coffee. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Water is still free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In 2008, U.S. Airways had tried to demand for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage, passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them on an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Frontier has gone, however, is the most in this area. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> On Wednesday the miles have been cut to 25 percent of the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore only 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money. </seg>

<seg id="2188"> Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 proposals were available, five are still in the race. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For its program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such missions &quot;l&quot; is about a billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were discussed, five of which are now in the final round. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot;cosmic vision&quot; to find answers. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact processes for the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the proverbial dark. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In order to investigate this issue will start in 2017, the space telescope &quot;,&quot; with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The possibilities are limited, however, is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With larger instruments astronomers erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Ultimately, this question is to say what conditions for the emergence of life. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from the system. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In our solar system, these processes can. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot; Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> The Esa sees the first of the three L-missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; programme. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Eight years later they reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the basic physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> How the universe was created and what is it? </seg>
<seg id="2227"> 13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> In addition to the usual from the stars, planets and life as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, which is the expansion of the. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws of physics in the first of the Big Bang &apos;split second were valid, is dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> &quot;Euclid&quot; the Esa has already been approved by a mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could make the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process only two. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts &quot;E-Lisa,&quot; a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> They were not detected. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could create the, the scientists hope behind the project. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission provides two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> He could, in contrast to plants on Earth&apos;s gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called &quot;Athena,&quot; which, among other things, is to explore black holes, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot; to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Already retired include proposals on the sample-return transport from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids and, as well as to the solar physics. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools </seg>
<seg id="2243"> On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> These are the first such directives issued by the US, as the number of school children with food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The guidelines provide information for schools, the faculty and staff to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> It is also recommended that schools Epinephrin stock - the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used in order to deal with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Children may say: &quot;It feels as if something is on my tongue,&quot; &quot;my tongue feels as if a hair on my tongue,&quot; or &quot;tickles.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2260"> At approximately 14: 15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a walkers, said his dog, Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high sales in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and seilte to rescue Rubys, which was then transported in a Hundebox upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: &quot;She was in a dangerous situation. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> It was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters away from the top and the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> They moved a muscle during their rescue – she was frozen stiff. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> But now it is good. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Then she has eaten a couple of dogs. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> It was a very unusual. </seg>

<seg id="2269"> Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: &quot;Ruby had a giant luck.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2270"> There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> Ruby was brought to the veterinarian to investigate, but said nothing except exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;When watching the rescue was scary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2273"> I could not believe that she was really up there. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The vet said that if the exhaustion has become too big and it would have collapsed, they would probably crashed. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The firefighters have done an outstanding job. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> It was really brave, what they have done. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> We are just so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Scott Alderson from Keighley added: &quot;We were afraid that they would fall, but they remained above.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2282"> U.S. border: &quot;Super tunnel&quot; discovered the drug smuggling </seg>
<seg id="2283"> On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a &quot;super-tunnel&quot; for drug smuggling and. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> As the US customs authorities, was the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Three suspects were arrested, seized eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The tunnel was, according to the data has not yet been taken. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> &quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they can get away by digging under the radar,&quot; said the general prosecutor of the Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered at the end of the tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> At the drug gangs assured Duffy: &quot;If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-running battle against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Since 2006, more than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug-related crime. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Constructed by experts </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators estimate that it was designed by architects and engineers, and that the construction took about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> The track was so that they could be used electrically powered cars. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> On the Mexican side of the access in a building that is 80 meters away from the border. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters in depth to the tunnel entrance. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters wide. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> He would have to encourage illegal immigration to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it said at the press conference in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This shows the &quot;desperation&quot; of drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug searches in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> They would do everything to get to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> The detainees were given no details, at least one is Mexicans, it said. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> They must count on prison sentences of up to ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Obama&apos;s climbdown in health policy </seg>
<seg id="2309"> After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: &quot;If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2310"> After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in the last few days, he had misled the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Yesterday, Obama watered down its original promise. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> &quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages to look for a new insurance on the open market. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;You get a better offer,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;I would like to say that Americans very directly: They deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform since October &quot;abysmal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2319"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I am determined to regain your confidence. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> This is a seated behind her manager at yesterday&apos;s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican legislators Billy Long from Missouri. It was a question of whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> After more than three hours of hearing Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed on the question of why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance, in order to complete a at HealthCare.gov, she now wants to sell millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Parents can choose children &quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but &quot;vague&quot; or &quot;not&quot; on the birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against the people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> A intersexuelle person, according to BBC years later said: &quot;I am neither man nor woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I remain a patchwork quilt, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> They belong to the, a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot;sexual differentiation disorder&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was perhaps more. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States, you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide - if any - for an operation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;blade for a good cause.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Sexual interaction children represent an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical procedure, but for most children are not,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> No one knows why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It is like the mystery of why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These properties were in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults on official documents, male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; reported. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world&apos;s first &quot;gender-free&quot; person, after a court had granted the maintenance of a &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> German identity cards besides M and W, in a third allocation, in addition to the future, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law, saying: &quot;If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies will be assigned to a sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said of the parents&apos; website. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, called Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that you can wipe out and then rebuild. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> But in the meantime, questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> &quot;In the middle of the 20th century, we called this a&quot; psychiatric emergency, &quot;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person is male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> But in one under the title &quot;John / Joan&quot; case from 1966 his theories have been controversial. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not,&quot; says Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> With 38 but he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations to the public, who are &quot;not happy with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2368"> For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life &quot;as a man. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> So external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> At the age of 12, he received female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> &quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he said on ABCNews.com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he asked for his medical records. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What he found was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD, through his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> The operation, he has become infertile. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;could&quot; encourage stamping and. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> &quot;Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to&quot;, &quot;she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We fear that favours intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adult recognition as a third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2388"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> The German law is about the allocation at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> This is not a fight, which should be small children at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law &quot;authorize&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Baratz&apos;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Although she is infertile, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions,&quot; said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this way, everything is in order, the child and loves it. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> It was a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And we must not rush to make an operation that will not. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and it is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> This will be able to make the decision themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellent mastered the fight </seg>

<seg id="2413"> In addition, the role of the old fisherman and a character role excellently Janson. </seg>

<seg id="2423"> Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese researchers artificially bright protein. </seg>

<seg id="2428"> The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH value. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> If the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful Leuchteffekt. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>

<seg id="2436"> He says: &quot;I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> That in itself is impossible because of the refraction, which is caused by the ice crystals of ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it. </seg>

<seg id="2507"> The disposable society does not think </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The night was long, loud music and the mood is good, but at some point, it is home. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat of hunger. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Clearly, a cocktail or champagne may be responsible for it. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> What is more natural than chilled to drive to the next Drive-In to take a bite? </seg>
<seg id="2512"> I admit that I am happy with it, if it is late at night or early in the morning to fast food-fetching. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> A few fries, a Coke and a burger - and then as the home and go to bed. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> What must be missing that constant regularity of its fast-food bags from the car window?! </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Especially at the weekends discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> &quot;Why?,&quot; I wonder. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The people are too stupid to take the bags home or until the next dustbin? </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It is not just that the landscape disfigured the paper. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Bags have also been concealed transport facilities such as crash barriers and triggered accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> So what does this &quot;disposable society&quot; but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If it is more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how to take a back seat after all nights: Clothes, bottles and other garbage are there. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> There were a few bags more or less, but nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to eat the remains of other rumtrampeln. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> I can already see the day when the cities and communities to dopey removal - and the fast-food chains for their bags. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Milk and egg alternatives at a glance </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Vegane diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Pürierter tofu cream with plants, for example, is a Quark replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Further calls Vegetarierbund Weltvegantag on November 1. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The Vegetarierbund Germany proposes on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on November 1, a series of vegan alternatives: </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Pure Flora margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt will be replaced by soy yogurt. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Instead of milk, soy,, rice or almond milk can be used. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Aufschlagbare plants replace conventional whipped cream. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Also there are herbal alternatives to eggs. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Also Apfelmus 50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for them. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Soft doughs instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three Esslöffeln mineral water. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> According to the vegan Vebu feed is currently around 800000 people in Germany, so. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> A black box in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2540"> American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution to be found in a small black box, the space in the dashboard of each car. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices, which record and report the information to the authorities, the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and that the government of the small boxes to record mileage - and, possibly, where they were driven and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states wait no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> They are looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, in which drivers pay per mile driven. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS tracking, already tested. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> This really is a must for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;There is nothing that we will only use may be,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government, which is planning a record of driven miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The way we pay these taxes, will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology is there. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> But in America is no longer as much fuel as before. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars use less gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> &quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> The federal government has recently 500 cars with black boxes, which are tested a mileage-based payment system. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;This is the most sensible alternative, in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken with the idea to drivers pay zurückgelegter route. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> People pay directly for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, the people who in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Several states and cities move on their own in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> The most active is Oregon, which is currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York City also is considering. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois is testing it in a limited way with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the change. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The concept is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Thus, Khan, the public would be some. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The company is not originally started to help states in the taxation of drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the basis of miles. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> But the devices are also tested for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with to give drivers a number of choices. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> You can opt for a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by the devices with more features than with little. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> &quot;Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate,&quot; says a planning document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Some traffic planners, however, are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge distraction. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, will be imposed, so that they also pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> &quot;There is no need for an operation, if an aspirin is enough,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists are concerned about their privacy and many other things. </seg>

<seg id="2657"> For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country&apos;s independent government. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could in the next few years investments of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> RENAMO claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes, it could have on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos attacked. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as &quot;losers&quot; who &quot;wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement in. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> He told the FT, he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> &quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial incentives from the government. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, headed by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country&apos;s democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> &quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south routes. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> The instability has increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave of abduction. </seg>

<seg id="2873"> The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The revelation is the surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Stan and John competition on the 2012 campaign, &quot;double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and they reported on Thursday evening that the president Topberater &quot;extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011&quot; had carried out to find out whether the appearance of Obama&apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election, if he let fall Biden. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book traces the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers to replace the former Secretary of State Clinton against the vice president. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the president, including Daley, Obama&apos;s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former senior White House adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> In &quot;double Down&quot; is said, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to Biden, despite their &quot;close, personal relationship&quot; before eventually decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton&apos;s candidacy &quot;would not significantly improve the chances of Obama&apos;s.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2880"> In an interview with Martin Daley, confirmed that the government was considering to replace Biden by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> &quot;I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and that was one of them,&quot; Daley told the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> We must remember that the President had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: &quot;For God&apos;s sake, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> While Daley described the investigation as &quot;due diligence,&quot;, said Martin to Anderson Cooper of CNN that had been operated during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move to the ballot box auszahle. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> &quot;In campaigns is not spent so much money on surveys and focus groups, if you don&apos;t think seriously about something,&quot; said Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Martin said on CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss had known about the potential change. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Although Daley said that he does not believe that the President of the possible change was &quot;aware&quot; the former chief of staff, admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama did not know about it. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Martin added that &quot;double Down&quot; deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings have reached Obama&apos;s desk. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Cooper asked Martin if he seriously think that Obama did not know of the inquiries about whether to drop Biden in the elections. </seg>

<seg id="2893"> The Gemeindesäckl in oven cheeks-Schönach is well stocked and debt already knows the administration since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The 2012 budget can be achieved in this sense as an unqualified success. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> As Andrea Roth mouth explained, is the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million euros, more than a million euros higher than planned. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The surplus of the administrative budget is around one million euros over the approach, with about 1.8 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Thanks to the surplus mainly higher business tax revenues and the share of income tax. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> The capital budget was again well above the planned values. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Instead of the EUR 1.5 million, EUR 2.5 million last year. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;This is due largely to the higher feed from the administrative budget,&quot; says Roth. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Since the financial year 2012, has been made less investment than planned, the reserve supply. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> Overall, the general reserve by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million euros. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> But after countless times, I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am with my point at the end. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I have reached a point of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished, the government misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And the most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I do not know if that is what I should have expected. </seg>

<seg id="2951"> And that bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I was re-elected in 2012, Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not its direction and positions. </seg>
