<seg id="1"> A strategy Republican hinder the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Leaders Republicans justified its policy by the need to fight ballot-rigging. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, the latter Brennan believes Centre a myth and says the vote-rigging is less frequent United States the number die of fall lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Of fact, lawyers Republicans have not found more 300 cases of electoral fraud United States ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Here, these measures will undercut partly democratic system American. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada, States Americans are responsible for the organisation federal election United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And a majority of governments Americans enacted, from 2009, new laws still hampering registration process or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has spread after the elections November 2010, the increasing 675 new representatives Republicans on 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consequently, during 2011 introduced 180 projects bill restricted the right of vote on 41 States. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters present a identity document with a photograph, also proof non-citizens. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, these laws cut periods early-voting, maim the right to register as constituent the of the scrutiny and withdrawn their right to vote citizens with criminal records. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections 2006, no state American required voters submited a document of identity with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The rule Indiana first it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court confirmed at 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> On recent years these authorities have supported projects in 34 States to force voters to present a identity document with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Is important take account of, the contrast to Quebec US citizens not have a document, as the card universal identity Social Security. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed, 11% of citizens Americans 21 million of voting age, have no identity document with photograph issued by a government agency of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore, five million new constituents 2012 lacking identity document with these characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="21"> , but often, required identity costs document more 100 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> With which, the new restrictions affect disproportionately the young, the minorities and persons low-income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of persons earn less than 35 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of between 18 and 29 not have identity with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And even more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On many states students, voters more vote candidates democrats, cannot use the document of identity with photograph your institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Furthermore, these States authorise members of clubs or hunting tend to vote party Republicans to use documents issued by such clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004 no state demanded proof citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state in present this requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> From 2011, a dozen States has adopted laws which require voters are showing American people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures seek, clearly, limit the vote Spanish matter. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Seems two every three constituents Hispanics support the party Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Furthermore, legislators Republicans supported 2011 certain laws abolishing entered constituents the same day of scrutiny eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Furthermore, cramping the right of people and groups create a service of assistance voters to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions have consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, general elections 2004, campaigns of registering voters contributed the registration of around ten million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Measures adopted since 2009 achieved rate of registering new voters into 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Furthermore, legislators Republicans adopted laws others five States favouring period for the vote by advance. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example elections 2008 Florida, 33% voted for advance voters were African-Americans, while recent accounted for but 13% of state voters. </seg>
<seg id="39"> For Hispanics occurred exactly. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Is 11% of voters, a 24% of citizens vote for advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However, whites, which represent 76% of electorate, not represent 46% of citizens vote for advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, legislators Democrats and their supporters objected fervently to adopting laws which restrict the voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Here, governors Democrats have blocked several projects bill. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The prosecution US intervened to suspend laws more controversial. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Was,, to limit damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 34 States adopted the law demanded the presentation a document identity with photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, is undeniably the new rules adopted complicate the right vote on 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics Democrats denouncing the party laws voted, since it is clear with be influence the results 2012 the key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report of the Centre Brennan 2011 shows States which have adopted such laws represent 171 of the necessary 270 votes polling achieve Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Is too early to say with certainty if these legislative changes city-wide electoral system significant will impact the presidential election results 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> A thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Here, measures will undermine partly democratic system American. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Cancer detection prostate: could Hacerse the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the test of PSA is occasions, results incorrect, with false results false results negative or even positive, following decided interventions medical useless. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Is a reason enough to wavering men, already reluctant, on if should be or not tests of detection. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Do Hacerse the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> Have asked board two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies US detected a great index of infection between the groups sample it is hard interpret these data and make recommendations firm. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The European study showed mortality certain difference among patients had made detection and the not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study monitoring 12 years, proved moreover between the 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if not achieved tests detection. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from 50, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men of origin African-American have a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is take a good decision once detected cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Is cancers aggressive and others cancers which are lax. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Is really need that the patient understand the degree of risk its cancer. Must provide all options and not necessarily dealing cancers prostate not violate the lives long-term which case must opt rather active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today many men which has detected a cancer are not Treaties, as said cancer is not aggressive or entails a risk their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Instead, I suggest active surveillance of the disease and if this progressing, offer them treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Determine increasingly often criteria precise to decide who should or not be Treaty. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Recommend the test anyway. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But is important speaking with medical to determine if must be the test or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Movember has created, cooperation with the International Society of Urología, a tool that allows assess the pros and cons of test of PSA. </seg>

<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is a recipe miraculous to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of investigations, adopting habits healthy remains best reduce risks suffer the disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> We if everyone eat well and move enough, could prevent 30% cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &apos;If nobody smoke, this rate up at least 50%&apos; stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman company Canadian Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> Instead evaluated around 10% of cancers are inherited. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Many other remains totally inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Society Canadian Cancer, combating smoking remains a priority despite the fall deters. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Tobacco is growth-linked 85% of cases lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Is also a risk factor for other types of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Greatly harms health of people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &apos;Today still is 1.5 million smokers in Quebec &quot;, declared spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> A fact hopeful: ten years after stop smoking, the risk of dying of cancer halved. </seg>

<seg id="104"> The bosón details Higgs </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of likely discovery of bosón Higgs generated consternation last summer, and with right. </seg>
<seg id="106"> , the bosón is involved mechanism responsible for the mass all on the universe, nothing less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our better or &apos;less bad&apos; explanation of nature and the behaviour, has not yet been noticed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But to physicists not clearly be Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Know undoubtedly a new particle and resembles the bosón Higgs predicted by the model standard. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Furthermore, new data revealed this week a important congress physics concluded Kyoto appear confirm is, although still more data to be safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> All ways presumably is Higgs, already that the possibilities mistake seem to few. See what. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is great world, a law and inevitable widespread involved that two things not the same place the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way of infringing and not this rule try too, because will getting damage. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Although physics particulates is a world very complex, proved in it there a law of these characteristics: the principle exclusion Pauli, stipulating two particles cannot occupy the same space simultaneously if are same “state quantum &apos;; a&apos;&quot; state consisting, broadly some of characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Physicists fall particles two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> By a part faced with good citizens so-called fermiones supporting wisely the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And are the bosones, a dirty bunch of anarchists not has respect for nothing, or not by this principle, which means on the same place and the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the website The Particle Adventure of Laboratories Berkeley which is extraordinary, the bosones fall into two: the groups landlords, not discuss here, and the &apos;particles force&apos;, for which the large forces of nature spreading and with which the bosón Higgs would some form relative. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosones, might emphasize are not the gruesome creatures exotic we could believe. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Indeed, if achieved read this chronicle, is thanks to a bosón extremely banal: the fotón or &apos;particle light&apos; acts as&apos; messenger &apos;of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with a burden electric accelerates or changes direction, &apos;repeatedly&apos; the field electromagnetic at the environment; a little as when launched a stone to a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This&apos; mess&apos; begets a wavelength electromagnetic (of light the infrared, the ultraviolet, etc) and this wavelength is not a fotón; namely one of the bosones&apos; bearers. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> Field stable more </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same Higgs bosón, is other field, the field Higgs, which needs be &apos;disorderly&apos; to this appear bosón. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Now, the field Higgs is much more stable the field electromagnetic. For be needed to energies activate extremely high, a little as a icy pond which only a higher rock could glide by the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Therefore lacking immense accelerator of particles as the CERN (the great Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to achieve such standards energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the field electromagnetic is a new tool explains the relationship between the Higgs and the masse. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Not all particles or all materials interact with the field electromagnetic. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, as magnets, do, but other not: a piece of part, for example sustained never alone clung to the door of a refrigerator. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And the same way, not all particles interact with the field Higgs: the do have a masse, while the rest (how the fotón, incidentally), not the have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what &apos;can make&apos; all such research?, question Madam Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and, furthermore, physicists escrutinen differences between the comments and the predictions of MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> For its part, many want fervently, because the lower difference could open a door to a &apos;new physical&apos; tape model certain holes. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, has still major gaps as not explanation proposes on the seriousness (UPS!) or dark matter, which is around 80% of the the Universe (another UPS!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But not have found such differences on CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Repercussions </seg>
<seg id="137"> Impact of such investigations our day-to-day are difficult of predict, but not believe mistake to say which will have no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> To see: the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers laboratories not suspected the result revolution its work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Entreveían applications scientific, but nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked laboratories Bell, where invented lasers on 1960, and by the first continued lasers (the first were pulsados) 1962, the principle lasers was rather considered a &apos;laboratory apparatus&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And applications also can also proceed throughout the orchestration surrounding research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a captador light on 1969 during their research optical. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Despite was no its original intention, this captador serves now &apos;eye&apos; to all digital appliances the world, which Award Nobel physical 2009. </seg>

<seg id="189"> 53% of patients admitted at the heart Victor-Gadboisarrivent is of home and 47% of hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> 77% Canadians simply cannot access palliative care, is say, to treatment designed to alleviate suffering when a ill reaches the stage terminal their lives, is at home in the hospital or a centre of care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several bodies, as the heart Victor-Gadbois and society palliative care door-to-door of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Is precisely this major omission in healthcare Quebec what many doctors specialist palliative care fear adopting a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> From the October, a manifesto signed by Eminences of palliative care, as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate its opposition to such initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr Christiane Martel, the health system Quebec is not sufficiently competent as to ensure anyone has right to palliative care quality earlier accepted proceed with euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &apos;Recently&apos;, tracing &apos;seen a patient proceed 14 days knee-capping experiencing major pains without having done the necessary to relieve this. </seg>

<seg id="204"> But there palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful the treatment pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care door-to-door of Grand Montréal, patients not answer treatments on pain 8% of cases. </seg>

<seg id="757"> Few were the saw this as the main income planned or stay there long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now, constantly failure in interviews with workers McDonald who complain for of this salary, and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> Furthermore, a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal a comment whose points out it irresponsible bear children if not know with what to eat. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Players protests, which began to 6: 30 Thursday morning the McDonald of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded the tellers and cooks fast-food they start pay for least 15 $per hour, they double its minimum wage current. </seg>
<seg id="761"> Also demanded sector fast-food of the creating unions workers. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The law of the US prohibits the administration prevent this right and punish activists unions with skulduggery and redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> Furthermore, rarely it administration life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But, for objective reasons, is easy unions cover the sector food rápid. </seg>
<seg id="765"> A major staff is the excessive rotation. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discordant </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place this same day others restaurants cheap Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of action rally took place half McDonald the near Times Square, involving several politicians local democrats, particularly the Council member Municipal the city Jumaane Williams, who said: &apos;McDonald says is selling billions of portions, and then even teaches you a hospital or you pays for your work honest&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrators received the support of other highlighted Democrats New York, for example candidate to Mayor of the city Bill of Blasio, which said &apos;must support workers fast-food sector receive to achieved fair wages and economic prosperity deserves each neoyorkino&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described the newspaper New York Times, this was the greater demonstration such American history of the fast-food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But few involved hundreds people even, not all were employees fast-food service, where trabakan tens of thousands New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Is not yet clear if this will spark to cause a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &apos;For now, deceive the brain is not easy&apos; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The issue of reality improved so popular among fans to technologies modern, late perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> To early summer, annual conference Google showed a model movement and subsequently, November, it transpired Microsoft tabled also a request to claim the corresponding patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, a conversation with chief interactive technology 3D the laboratory Cambridge Microsoft, Izadi Sharamom, was illuminating to scientists this company glasses already belonged to a stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> To them attracts the perspective manipulation of objects virtual on air with the hands naked and the creation spaces open virtual. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please generally what is the studied its research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are the interaction persona-ordenador, but we extend the limits of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For now humanity its mass has been stage trapped work pixels of the screen flat, sometimes the is the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we looking 5-10 years forward and guessing the changes in this interaction cardinal. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the console Xbox and sensors represent a step Kinect and today no Xbox sells without Kinect, already interested all control by gestures. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - what more the future holds? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite led Kinect interaction physical the level, much of this still happens on a screen flat, to times 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The introduction information has improved (the system receives more), and exit still is not very good. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Are seeking to change systems this, work imaging really three-dimensional, based on different technologies, including the of design. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Must ridding the world computer the our, the physicist, more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this, however, is necessary acknowledge the user, but also the area. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then can complete the real world with objects virtual a more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Firstly, the devil with these fools helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - what you think about control by voice? </seg>
<seg id="792"> A detail very popular, but not believes it over-estimate? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - surely not can consider a panacea, remains resolving, already privacy not always wants others listening of our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Indeed, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own area. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices into public places, had a project that consider gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Furthermore, gestures were caught not by the Chamber of the device but by a wristwatches which had the movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> For now, but theoretically can be reduced the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, overall, the future is for combined control, for example gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - how this is? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - Of example, how I ask you forward this tin of Soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You will and the shows the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Normally I only speaking. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, this will be hard recognise. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - or is, you to force users adapt to what can or cannot do the machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - not necessarily, but is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Believe a future next we have to work design mainly new types sensor to determine precisely the reactions. </seg>
<seg id="807"> These can be, for example sensors already lasers, which provide a good resolution in-depth, what is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If we his work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what complaints you cameras modern? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Do you lack resolution, thoroughly or more? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation is what can be the start of our work with the recognition three-dimensional. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, be good 8 megapíxeles to the speed 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But issue is not the megapíxeles but on quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From this last view, all existing technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Or is, we must remind not only the resolution on axes X and and, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Is also important speed, the number scoreboards by second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond, sensor contact with retardation processing adjustable 1-100 Ms and mention that modern sensors produced serial are closer the second value 60-100 (). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everybody understands how much this affects the interaction hombre-máquina. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I be very useful for my work equivalent of such device but not require contact to datasheets by second more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - and is not need to increase the number cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> The Kinect now has three &apos;cameras&apos;, a of which is the issuer of infrared and the second recipient the signal reflected. </seg>
<seg id="822"> But the third chamber is actually a simple sensor of standard visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This is not used to determine depth of subject. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or contrary, increase it and increase amount required calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> A, play analogous flexible Kinect with the curvature of location cameras and see how this would help determinr the position three-dimensional. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Concerning I recall Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Does view of daily use of technologies reality increased, glasses are a platforms more visible? </seg>
<seg id="829"> -, everything the time holding a smart phone the hands, is not oh-so-comfortable, but I: the better option would be a reality increased &apos;transmutable&apos; when, basis of a platform of cloud, you could move of glasses the smart phone, </seg>
<seg id="830"> Glasses are devices very personal, this is its strength (things private only you can see them), but also its weakness: a reality increased based on glasses not will work on objects with others virtual. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - imagine if manipulation objects virtual holográficos air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film &apos;Iron Man&apos;, but also for any simple deadly. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem in this idea critics often point to: must táctil response! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The not feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answer prepares its Group for this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my conferences often say the reality increased is the seventh arrival on the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Believe the eighth could well be the addition of sensations tactile. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand as support for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It records tact perfectly! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies which are genuinely aimed to provide tangibilidad to these &apos;images on the air&apos;. For example, interference several rays ultrasónicos to a specific point the finger gives a sense similar to one feels if someone was soplándole the buds of, but this feeling is still very weak. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Also bracelets to the doll influencing nerve endings detect tissue of the fingers, this also a direction promising. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - has addressed fooled the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Is to think he feels what should feel the moment sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - That is a good idea, still we have not tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lurks another challenge to we fight long, how to a person physically located a very reduced creates that will a open space, almost without end. Are also working on the idea of the tapes run (not as the of gyms), mobile platforms, as the balloons giants. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For now, deceive the brain is not easy, are still work years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Is what is work with virtual reality for researchers, many things are a state total conception. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Personal taste subjective instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &apos;Rosbalt&apos; continue avant-gardism the &apos;project San Petersburg&apos;, spent citizens, to the forefront art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This list of the best are brilliant figures art and stage San Petersburg, whose achievements arrive beyond recognition town: often find in Europe without Russia know even. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of &apos;Rosbalt&apos; is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> All the city knows Kirill Miller, a man barbudo bluefin dress top-down, which is find Museum close Russian, around Garden Summer or meetings fashionable and inauguraciones. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The scoreboards Kirill Miller always attracting crowds, wherever it displayed. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one such cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of San Petersburg, creators new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-gardism San Petersburg of the late 1980s - the early 90. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Furthermore, is a urban, whose appearance on the city streets of the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, took their a organillo and became the San Petersburg, already organillero has matured to difficult role Bohemian, for their existence, their philosophy and its image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why go by the city bluefin dress and not yellow or turquesa, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - chose the red colour because I fashion designer and I dedicate to the appearance and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> This world the red colour is a compromise between the artist, creators images and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although society, everything which is not a little grey raises aggressiveness and turmoil good properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are addressed unleashed a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="862"> History my action provocative are a invitation the debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - when comprendiste which debías be artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - In exposure of Culture Nevsky, where they my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old artists unofficial had over, and the new, free as I, were still incomprendidos. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I friend artists of the new wave, with the after the outlined Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to &apos;Pushkinskaya-10&apos;, and already ended the new wave. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I sumí the theatre for clothes, music all the genders but not letters. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And all this coupled on your Clínica of art... - To me was important be on the cultural centre San Petersburg, where were the best minds creative. </seg>
<seg id="870"> On 1995, I territory Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while not had reforms, existed a club artistic musical, a club bohemio, the House of Bohemian San Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember how brought the project Schnur to &apos;The ear of Van Gogh&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Schnur and friends danced songs light under phonogram, vestían trousers tight, between them was the currently composer fashionable Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to play alive, became &apos;Leningrad&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg was cheerleader many programmes before Hali-galivskih. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Gave to Trachtenberg and was the start its great race; basic education and training the received of us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Gallery D 137 &apos;, the&apos; Club Griboyedov, are relics Clínica the Arte. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There were our employees and customers assiduous. </seg>

<seg id="879"> 2000, the survey was the press, the prize was&apos; The people of our city &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> On nomination &apos;artist of the Year elected I, ended my culmination. </seg>
<seg id="881"> These is not work new times comfortable; I a man likes the truth honesty and the culture of last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Our is times easy to popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but little worship. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - there your work recognisable. Something </seg>
<seg id="884"> Very of my paints are hits, which clearly expresses present and the occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="885"> Going to make a exposure scheduled, &apos;The Russian Museum on clowns&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns are a status timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I was accessible, but now be is painful and frightening. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But the clowns all embadurna and tragedy removes. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I delighted how grotesque, I ideas grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example salvation of the world through a change totalitarian and mandatory clothes. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now one are for clothes, moving external, but not within the person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And, perhaps person not should and hand, but escupirle the. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And deception remove when change clothing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Earlier you saw the role organillero of urban. - One city cultured must take a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who better than I to be! </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Well but best art commercial can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Now the art commercial must be scrupulous, sweet, bear tact. </seg>

<seg id="899"> Before people was formed on herds, the bohemios wanted a thing, the simplones other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all have divided into micro-communities, is difficult please all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Am not a ticket 100 dollars to taste all. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now is who quieres like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each hero of worship has its 100 fan. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - and to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - Van to see the abandoned, there it the field sexo-social. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And a cultural event are 300 people, ten thousand never come. As result, less management, less money, all withering. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I my fan, more important is not hoodwinked, not spoil what you achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When was young was such tables to a art-collecting the tapeworms strung on the wall alongside Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with paints, with which people usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Say culture spiritual, culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> No culture, this is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example artists living in poverty and died poverty refused the money only to paint pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what lacks San Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Buenos experts culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is a concept: officer culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all can work culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> When kings were right all was differently kings perhaps not comprised well culture, but knew need maintain experts courteous. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Moscow now there is very good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> Have people St Petersburg well could be experts, but are closed, because need to a experts top-level correctly assess they and I open path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now is thriving the personal taste subjective. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but the difference is they say honestly not art modern is accepted, some artists who must seek others museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - what is for you San Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - San Petersburg not a capital cultural. Moscow much more culture, there ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> But on our stones is difficult art grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Need cultural and have now more writers readers, it. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Europe is a lot of people with curiosity will exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> Our case, is this class tiny. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make the art fashionable, as was to the early last century. </seg>

<seg id="960"> &apos;This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies as this must be&apos;, commenting Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Yet achieved tackle the problem reproduction directly space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Is a difficult challenge. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing their habitat usual, simply cannot make its sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Man, however, unlike the small animals, principle, can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and able of creating a fund emotional appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Experiments similar is not conducted for reasons ethical. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel the area for already 50-year. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greater risk what spent Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And most precious of humanity is the body female. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gaviota, and nobody on Earth could say: if is after a flight the area. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Can or not having a baby after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &apos;After all, this question nobody has responded&apos;, commenting veteran of aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> On June 1964 only after a year flight the area, the first woman a cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, also was a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> 1988, the second woman a cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in-orbit and even worked on the open space, had a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk persists. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Are few, are counted astronauts who after long flights all has result sake and a generation healthy is growing. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &apos;and if can say more, is dangerous even on flights orbitales&apos;, summarises the pilot a cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov. </seg>

<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the baby is roughly 9 months within its stem the amniotic fluid, because I be easier used then water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, because from the moment birth until the time of first bathing spend only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &apos;This is little to forget something, &quot;says Marina Aksenova, monitora swimming newborn. </seg>
<seg id="989"> On short, if the weightlessness is a been more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary gravity, force of gravity. </seg>

<seg id="1009"> At the committee meeting control Congress of Deputies, you spoke team between the common project Czech and German, the context of which compared the legislation the award public both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What is exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Is a control parallel we make some two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Said simplified: European legislation regularises how to organise the award public, this is existing legislation each country and then the praxis itself. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have united all and, although the control is not finalised, achieved differences very interesting. Generally, legislation of our country is&apos; stricter and more complete &apos;, however, the praxis specific parameters is better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This therefore confirms not enough with incorporate rules ever-tighter, but is must focus on law enforcement. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What can make fact this project? what believes that are the conclusions? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Common control of this kind could contribute to importance investing efforts applying laws, reduction and improvement limits, although this not impacting. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy savings means achieving a appropriate thing reasonably-priced (what not always mean the price is the lowest) to prevent enrichment, and eventually, action criminals. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact reduce the limit award means we this. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps because the system is saturated so &apos;red tape&apos;, those want to find failings will system easier if maintained limits as high as now. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You discussing the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the prácticaa of the award public. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the system controls Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is an office like our NKÚ or organises differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> How bureaux, as the NKÚ, there acts Bundesrechnungshof the (Federal audit), with a organisation similar to our, with a college also, all is it is structured the both different, but principle both offices develop parallel. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also competences are to some point analógas, but, as Germany has a organisation federal, courts all are even this level. Here differs slightly of our system. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only monitor the federal money, what here call state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds, administered by regions and municipalities, there, Germany, control the Federal Audit. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> On local legislation, is simpler the our? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Generally not I would comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model some aspects, but cannot be state exactly what is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Could be better, for example, on quality inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This certainly not, but, repeat, I like do such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Is be said even those countries take as model face a large number of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> If not not I would no benefit cooperate with our office, does not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Regarding legislation of our country, what meant to its Amendment law on the public procedures manifest? somehow its incidence? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given the validity of this amendment is relatively short, not said control activities. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since we controls ex-post need a delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> For now, notes the preparation process of future controls: initiated a &apos;new tool detecting risks non-economic&apos;, we fact 14,000 procedures nearly public have been analysed. Changes will perfectly reflected here, already amending the limits, are some types of conditions selection process and similar. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Does the approval of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a imbroglio to the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I believe this law is certainly a right step hope so. And </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is rules tighten &apos;&apos; and impossible deliver. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> With the previous rules, persons controlled were linked the contractor (for example, regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every law on procedures respected not public meant rape of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Does then sense toughen the law of this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Believe not this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those to attacking or exploit he and not punish those commit a failure formally, not has incidence decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system only achieved create greater bureaucratic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And how exceeds this? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> See where leads this road begun. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The first minister recently declared that the ODS not would employers with controls the so-called system švarc, with reference to fact be autonomous only on the role. What this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system švarc &apos;is prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be regulated somehow and, if prohibits something then even the first government minister can prevent action Office to must make such controls and require obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Can say: &apos;change the law and we allow&apos; but cannot say we as if nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> On law on the award public, regulation is rather strict terms of must act formally. And as must be to protect public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, furthermore, is tragic exclusion candidate with the better supply not meet the formal requirements. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never perfect, but implementation must be correct. This is my opinion, what. </seg>

<seg id="1128"> We all our efforts in participate in this project. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Demonstrated most of them interest and I amused work with us. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Why be spent money raised concerts against order the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Equipment for the Centre education barrier-free Studeo, term in its sixth year running civilian with partnership TAP Jedličkův ústav. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Pupils school Jedličkův ústav are regularly the visit of teachers with the amusing and interesting performing. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Pupils not have sufficient resources to pay teachers and we efuerzo to this. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Within the framework completion of the Jedličkův projects ústav be a building independent we move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Each concert several groups acting and interpreters. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> What are the selection criteria? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We drawing up a programme is attractive to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example Prague act Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> To more details consult www.kpks.cz. you, </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Is You scheduled some other &apos;action spectacular&apos; similar future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> First proceed in May in the festival Pražské jaro, so here surely prepare a attractive programme with guests interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we would also play Bohemian the National Hall New York and personally while we United States, I would amplify with action Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now have acted for example Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The TAP TAP, however, is a group disabled. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How is logistics and organisation of these journeys? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> Is not as difficult how can appear. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five Members wheelchair, the chairs must travel compartment to baggage and we much weight, boxes with the instruments... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> However, until now we managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly ready, which it puzzles me. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even Moscow, where we returned recently, went all without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the various attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What you you have found? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, all works better than here; in Russia we witnessed, this, is. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Unlike Prague, Moscow is full barriers, there remains frequent be a person moves single by the city centre to a wheelchair electric. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Something as and is, for example, give preference someone on wheelchair on lift, there is not. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, a civil partnership strives to focus attention the problems of the disabled. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> What aspects must take example of most progressive countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Many aspects in we behind... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But is important to mention perfecting and the improvement depends always of persons directly. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> On London and Madrid is very normal people with a disability serious switches alone in public and can go to the museum, wherever... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But is not very common which a large number of disabled participate in social lives actively here with The TAP TAP it a step ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> A society respectful or without barriers is a thing, but when the moment arising eminent sportspeople, artists, players political or lawyers begin to change everything. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Until now, are isolated cases of people have a great willpower. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The TAP TAP is currently popular, but looking years backwards, what you led to form the Group in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Entered carer as on Jedličkův ústav, where was quite young people my around wanted engage something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I musician, raised, others saxofón the founded a group amateur with a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we was a little hands (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> However, the popularity not to recent years, or I mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Is truth that helped us quite connect with singers famous and also work actively to promote the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We concluded that the work unseen, is as if not. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks aid the European Union, we afford to furthermore teachers quality, equipment, etc </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Do you had intention of go as far with The TAP TAP? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the principle saw the potential, can be something otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The showbiz is full things are each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Is logical, its way, everything new welcomes caution and time-consuming in acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Little extraordinary things, but I daresay The TAP TAP is one. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The impression someone to see us first is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But compassion is completely superfluous because the disabled are not abandoned beings suffer and should have compassion. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> People is capable of a full life and develop, provided by course, for the means. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say if something I goes well to disabled, then, is not only progress for them, but to all society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Is Ayudó the fact which is you a leader demanding, as I describes many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If do a work of quality, we must be rigorous many aspects and demanding discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> Think it perfectly normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the forefront clouds and when acquiesce must go two days test go to proof preparatory and long travelling and concerts the initial euphoria abandons them quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But this is how works everywhere, each group wants work and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently the group The TAP TAP 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many were already in the beginnings of 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group opened, people enters and leaves, cannot avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has will and want find open-door always the </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Will the day before the expected end of the world, the Thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 p.m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Will take place the Incheba Arena of Prague, Fléda of Brno and 12 in Ostrava and participate Plynojem and others musicians groups Czech </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The three cities connect the veiled through videoconference to sing together song the group The TAP TAP &apos;End of world cancelled&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The objective of concert is gather necessary resources to finance equipment multifunctional of central barrier-free education STUDEO on Jedličkův ústav of Prague, which cost rises 25 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Entry concert costs 400 CZK and children until 12 years have free entry in the early Bohemiaticket </seg>

<seg id="1247"> Consequently, this means the different ways systems economic and national economic conflict permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The cause is the free trade principle and of free movement private capital unlimited, together with financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The effect of large disparities in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation the manufacturer, with the goods imported cheap to gap and for this&apos; causes a bajadda &apos;the price of competitor with the aim of be with most of the market and thus increase profit margin. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, delocalise production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where the price of work compared with other economies, is higher. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital is not social responsibility and, with this, is not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows State necessarily social spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> All this conducive the full disinterest of entrepreneurs for pay taxes and damage social and economic caused to profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is universally so known that is not necessary statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Practices little handle of private capital create situations, certain economies, when governments of these countries forced to compete with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of the own population and thus attracting capital abroad the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Said otherwise, governments are private capital available to its own population disregarding the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is patent on all on changes laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim is to force people to accept dictated of private capital, especially as to wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This takes place, partly through the system obligation economic case long term unemployment; using the right restricted employees rights work. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a increasing poverty alongside the increasing differences between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> For a number of years, are Germany delivery points of food for poor people cannot be with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people receiving such assistance arrives already million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Under the increase competitiveness German economy produces a case quite: people employed with a salary so under the state must pay rest to minimum necessary for survive. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Was public a scandal of this kind on the situation of employees ancillary of Parliament German. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Savings measures practically all States southern EU lead undoubtedly the same situation. Persons pressured by decline social status abysmal, forced to emigrate and the nineteenth or malvivir paid in the limit rotten society, hoping someday private capital investor reaches the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Need preguntrarse where is? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The case of other EU countries, then poverty happens of a country to another or is never Chinese, since, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or African still work by a tiny part of a European salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This also affects all Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Theories Liberals and the media claim nauseam the state ought not capital bring the economy, to economy leads to its failure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital defends tooth-and-nail the thesis the state ought not intervene on the economy meddled on control. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then is necessary wonder if private capital influences with its selfishness on the march policy and therefore around the state. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here the answer is clearly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Proof is the existence of lobbies, practice very powerful and omnipresent, all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a straits to provide corruption, mutual the favors, of legislation is practically reprehensible everywhere but not is punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Germany the situation is: state ministries, lack of financial resources, responsible wording projects bill legal private companies, which are often linked with industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Such projects laws are adopted after the Bundestag, Parliament German. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> Of this way, all power not from the people, as announces constitutions of democracies Western, but the strong financial groups representing their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Is obvious democracies with a liberal-minded are rapidly describing situation how Appiános to his work The crisis Roman Republic times Caesar and Pompeii: &apos;the State wore time disintegrating and administrations thinks force&apos;. </seg>

Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy for always autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The conclusion, in antiquity, is society in today inconsiderate preferences the individual benefits without taking account of common interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private capital is not able, essence understand and claim the benefits all society. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result is the same that the then, a decadence of unprecedented elite, without a effort to deeply reforming it. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The causes booming fascist and communist regimes must sought therefore unbridled liberalisation systems economic twentieth the nineteenth and. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> With respect to the current situation, is possible consider disappearance of these systems benefit of a democracy, as a pause defined, waiting next blow. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact really damning is the elite current ignores losses hundreds of thousands in lives, disasters social and humanitarian of the we witnessed and crimes against humanity, as the know the history and the latest. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The suspension of the law on public is not the solution contracts; at least not long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure of economic competition, both internationally as within the EU, the government Czech Republic obliged to follow seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore systemic. </seg>

<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is the disorder arises of the need show too too action places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very facetious as contributors role Hollywood, although his characters deserved more area and not are, alone in this film. </seg>

<seg id="1502"> &apos;I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and, finally, something interesting to do&apos;, States Lisette Verhaig, a transeúnte through the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, technical IT a large company located close library, points: &apos;furthermore, the building is beautiful&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we need a library today. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All Internet, tablets and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> It by happy to those libraries passé? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a city bedroom situated the doors of Rotterdam scarcely deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honour having taken a record for forget. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The population 80,000 inhabitants presents the rate of literacy lowest of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> For counteracting this shameful, some years decided contribute somehow general culture and copying the represented fake appear seven bridges on euro notes part armed concrete miniaturas decoradas. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the education offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And was as policy-makers decided only was a opportunity to improve statistics: had to build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, study MVRDV Dutch architecture, all a master the art of the diagrams and responsible rods buildings fun while cynics, took the issue with its usual serenity and appeared the presentation the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and smiles. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked perplexed around and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to piling books size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words: &apos;Dear, </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here the you, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called &apos;Boekenberg&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years after, the mountain of billion closed 30 the runway. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> This part revitalisation, project supplementing with a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and asset-backed. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> To early November the mountain of books was awarded second prize &apos;Best Library of NL 2012&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Furthermore, the draft is also nominated the &apos;Dutch National Wood Award 2012&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Of this way, small city history lacking hitherto not had nothing more to offer pedestrian a zone post-modern and a local government incredibly ugly following whose façade blanche one intuiría rather a central dairy now has a work contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural its history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long way to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression is is a paradise books under quesera. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Well there is lift we transported fair the heart of this mountainous massif, but the real football-loving the reading space and not use it, but prefer merged with its topography each step escalation to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The internal completely acristalado is bright and easy of cover with view, the ground brick recocido and the glamour street lamps support unequivocally the public condition library. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The look can reach visualise the park, dogs and children play football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &apos;Normally the bookshelf are ready throughout the façade and the focus opens a huge room obscure generally usually something uncomfortable and impersonal&apos;, States Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> What us is put upside down classical configuration space and draw the area of reading Interior abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The mountain is well taken: the are offices, the Internet library, the club chess, the Education Centre environmental and room maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Deserve special mention black bear shelves the role padding mural, parapet and barandilla the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> View, the tact and the nostrils are strangers. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and civil engineers more the day shackle the forefront when hear speak of this material unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &apos;We wanted work with materials recycled&apos;, explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And is as a day on a farm Friesland, we have the by-product appropriate from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years, the greenhouses and the fields of the Netherlands uses fabric plastic scarce millimetres thick as basis to restrain the root crops. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Is a materials cheap and efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This fabric hard fine two stations and after dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> To the library this fabric prensó, first such quantities, to achieve planks four centimeters thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a materials obscure, homogeneous and resilient than smells a mix car new and zapatilla of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Following 105 rungs is the mountaintop. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> This route continuous almost half metres around the mountain awaits us the reward: from cafeteria not only has fantastic view of the city, but it can also be enjoy the flavoursome Dutch croquetas and their ficus planted huge pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> These create an environment Nice the couple maintained humidity air adequate to this mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations to a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &apos;Although perish the thought given their hypermarkets acristaladas, this building is a project exemplary regarding ecology&apos;, indicates Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Heating and cooling necessary gained from geothermal. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Despite the mountain of books is located under enormous glass pyramid, even the days more sunny the sun only shines during few p.m. inside. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The huge cerchas timber on sense cross-cutting the glass serve to give shadow and absorb the majority rays the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> This creates a internal climate comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest is thing of the shutters automatic. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker sector IT, already has dared to put on the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> And Lisette Verhaig has also been there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Equally, the professor of medicine traditional Chinese Cynthia Bogarde visited the library. It qualifies the &apos;Boekenberg&apos; and the &apos;late soul&apos; of Spijkenisse. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason is, the opening that took place a couple of weeks, invited all city residents to donate a book their private collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This to fill, the gaps optical of a library yet with its full archive; currently has 70,000 exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept has significance deep. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Are full shelves. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &apos;not is nothing worse than a library half-empty&apos;, says the architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &apos;I believe thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a link with this building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> All know their book forms part library. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Although only there for embellish. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> The study has achieved MVRDV a success in the discipline prevails slang the specialised is known as&apos; creation identity &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> City Spijkenisse has writing a part history of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Whatever uneducated young and. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> A starting point for shape the identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &apos;The Germans must play a role stronger&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, US expert relations UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin diplomatic position rather sharper. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: early weekend, Germany hinted which vote against the proposal to give territories Palestinians State status UN observer. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> However, finally Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany non-support what Israelis have fact Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now, to the special relationship unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But the same time nor supports the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted demonstrate independence without be too critical with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising Libya on March 2011, Germany abstained when it was was of establishing a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This has finally been declared NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Is Le is difficult Germany posturing clear when are at stake important international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Other, is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> This is because currently re-allocating its foreign policy, alienating a policy led,, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> And what further hinders things is Europeans have consistent policy and uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Therefore, Germans are at a crossroads. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Of them expects play Role more independent, but are unaccustomed. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> Believe still probing what its role, but have already started way towards a policy external normal &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy similar to the countries as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What means foreign policy &apos;normal&apos; from terms German? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Is a policy when is national interests, persuades to defend different positions to the United States or its European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Believe German foreign policy is a powerful motivation economic policy, is say, exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Economic interests Germans are to some point different from other major powers and therefore Germany must protect their interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken regarding the conflict Middle-East and the vote of the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> By a hand, Germany has large markets Middle-East, especially Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> For this reason careful and not must be into of Arab public opinion nor elites Arabs. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> This is important, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would such importance which is not a relationship perfectly unilateral. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> However, yes play a key role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Has Germany undermined its relation to US the abstain on important decisions and vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> Believe Europe and even US German, the position enjoys a huge degree understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore think has occurred drastic a break as Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps with this Germany has achieved curry a respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, all this has only demonstrate a country which take seriously as international player and whose interests. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Europe is different views Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Instead, US has clearly shown for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there disparity of views between US and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Have always existed these disparities due to internal policy American. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Believe government Obama shows secret a great understanding towards the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But, because of the situation policy live here clearly cannot defend government in public this position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I think the genuine disparity of opinions has no the importance attributed to it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Looking at relations between Obama and Israeli Premier Netanyahu, Obama is to nothing enthusiastic with the policy develops. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is Le is difficult Germany reconcile the close relations with Israel and United States, for a hand, with the position of its main partners at the EU, for another? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Think this making difficult for Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course be a little easier for Germans if a European policy consistent and homogenous, but is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, not have the possibility part of higher BLS, but must boost things from its own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is precisely what are doing now with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe the future Germany assume a leading role forcing Europe to adopt a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course this is nothing easy for Germany, whether simply by the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a tough subject. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But the Germans have clear must play the role of contained independent. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Is Germany itself into the role of important international player? does actually Germany assume a role protagonist? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or perhaps I remains proving difficult accept leadership? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet accustomed, is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country remains costing play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If see the euro crisis, for example, each time positions itself as Germany mega-player, unlash certain feelings antialemanes. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This is not easy for Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Is a old problem nobody wants be surrounded the countries enemies. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Seen this way, Germany uniquely much more difficult United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Must show receptive the different views neighbours and and this not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The influence of US in European policy diminishes increasingly, but the EU not moment covers this vacuum, who is then? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Germans not left to take a role stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if dislike, if it is unpleasant or if makes them a people even more unpopular, c&apos;est the vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is Director of the Transatlantic Academy Washington, a institution academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analysed jointly the challenges facing the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also member of Germany Marshall Fund, where specialises German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &apos;Protection of trappings&apos;: when Puma and Armani immediately become Chinese brands </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a brand known globally and Polo Ralph Lauren also. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> After this behalf hides a designation officially registered China but has nothing to originals. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, this enjoys protection while the real epónimos not submit a demand. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then is not clear they will to reason. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &apos;A foreigners find it increasingly difficult protect their brand China &quot;, points Thomas Pattloch, lawyer the practice Taylor Wessing specialist violations of rights Far. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week reaches my table a new case. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The imitators simply add a couple letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Of this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and rather than Prada is records Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies also copy legally similarly, as happened to manufacturer Puma sports. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens drawers which is seats the office brand Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The 14 September 2010 a Chinese company marking asked register Zegna DF Puma, a behalf artificial also of using home fashionable Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The Chinese are world champions this copying and violating the IPRs is well-known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> On cities plants there major warehouses several execution-only sale of counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, cases of Pattloch are other. For their customers, he combating the Trademarks Bureau give officially Chinese firms the right to benefit of a denomination is already recorded elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call &apos;Bang Ming Pai&apos; or marks companion. </seg>

<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities not feel guilty </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &apos;is damaging to the business, must combat this&apos;, requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &apos;The marks makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage which the image is enormous.&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and coasts procedural sectors affected billions are, especially the goods emblematic of luxury. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company CLSA market analysis, with a volume 15bn per year China is,, the third market and the luxury goods fastest-growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, achieve cancelling inscriptions of dubious legality records brands is complicated and furthermore supposed much money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Can processes prolong until nine years and the result uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch speaks cases where court dismissed a because had spent demand both the behalf aim demand already became a &apos;reality of market&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> &apos;If the complainant has unlucky, perhaps even pay money the plagiador because the process has damaged marking this China&apos;, indicates Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes this is the free-for-all. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Some cases best-known relate to elements graphs. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a case against the manufacturer machinery construction Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by the manufacturer German concrete bombs Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore today Chinese cannot continue using a emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used initially a logo blank and Blue recalled greatly BMW; the issue dirimió on courts and Geely had. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer clothing Lacoste lost China imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented crocodile a looking in the opposite direction to the original. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities not feel guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademarks Bureau CTMO Beijing recognises than 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, &apos;the situation labour emergency again normality&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Of this way, the amount processes complaint without processing has cut 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57 of these resolved resolved, 75% more the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However, 81.500 complaints continue pending. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Fight this costs money </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Typically China, the figures are surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year the CTMO recorded more 1.4 million protection applications trademark, almost one-third rather than 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Be a new record and means China leading by tenth time the list of new inscriptions worldwide, according to the trademarks bureau. </seg>

<seg id="1676"> 2011 would nicked by 1,800 billion yuan of rights. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> , which means of average each registration costs 1.28 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Combat this costs money, as shows the company German family Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more seven-year the group waging Court a copier Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While Germans have achieved halt the illicit manufacture of spare car imitation </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The copier has achieved rights ensure the Chinese on the mark Freudenberg. </seg>

<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg offered the part contrary a &apos;sum of six numbers euros&apos; with REACH a amicable agreement, but failed. </seg>

<seg id="1698"> Not enough trust international law on mark rights, but is&apos; also China whatever susceptible of protection &apos;, as indicated Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the issue can be more expensive than a simple register. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Of, where lose last round Freudenberg of their battle particular, then to pay the part contrary rights of licence by their own behalf, as explained Wentzler. </seg>

<seg id="2181"> See us as a reminder a humiliating defeat and we look above shoulder as if we a inferior not sufficiently Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> To their view, our existence is failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed Mexico, not gone. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And now we would not trapped after this smokescreen gloves, living well to the United States but, still, as souls solitary. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My woman, born in Guadalajara and wine legally the United States when was a girl, I recalls is this friction between the Mexicans and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more solidity who are and the seconds this resent. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although citizen of the United States, it feels part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses I know feel not part of none of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Love Mexican The hear the group Northern Tigers, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Have the best of each country, but you are not rooted to them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Mexico see us as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And the United States we believes Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, to complicate things, for what I learned during my trip some leaders Mexicans and intellectuals want reconnect to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as&apos; ambassadors&apos; of Mexico makeshift, representing their interests the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We say to our colleagues US fantastic which is visit this country and presionaríamos leaders politicians to strengthened ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, clear... </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Is too rancor. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, with inequality wages, corruption rampant and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure fantastic is a country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I fear you you will be alone with this idea friends. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> Is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States way treated a century ago and environment Mexico, then must accept the fact some mexicano-estadounidenses are still resented how treated less relatives long time. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps be more &apos;Mexicans&apos; what thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis unlikely for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Can have someday lasting peace between Arabs and Jews Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed which seem to any hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the pointless and usual discussions on who began first, piles buildings left in rubble; 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis murdered and, first, missiles from Gaza have fallen close Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, despite Israelis and Palestinians appear anchored to their former conflict, all to Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> Spring has left Arab all shattered like or not, Palestinians and Israelis stranded the regional fuss. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this make your fight even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, its lethal impasse could desencallarse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war which or loses or wins </seg>
<seg id="2215"> To first view, optimism currently looks very difficult to justify. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if maintained ceasefire agreed 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened hawks sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders Hamas, the Islamist movement which has governed Gaza since 2007, will say have obliged Israelis to withdraw despite Gaza has received a good whacking. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> And despite having killed some of its leaders got pressure and the 1.7 million Gazans one corners grimmest and villages of planet, Israel has not solve Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Of fact, Hamas is gaining ground West Bank, the other part Palestine currently governed by its hard-hitting rival Fatah, the Palestinian faction more moderate. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Furthermore, leaders Hamas may conclude time plays its favour. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Given Islamists have gone gaining influence for all the Arab world, Hamas has fact rich friendships and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power which previously the Muslim ally closest to Israel, has embraced the cause Hamas. Also Qatar, States more rich Gulf and dynamic. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The Member exhilarating Hamas say the Islamist Crescent collects Israel, from Lebanon north, where dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels a trend increasingly Islamist could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where allies Hamas are threatening the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Especially the South Israel, growth of the Brothers military-led Muslim the President Muhammad Morsi Egypt, with difference the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, despot secular government Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, not had too time to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Instead, the Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and their more leaders popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On future action diplomatic, Hamas emerges as protagonist the cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the hard wing Israel will conclusion opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On the military question, have put Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The anti-missile system Iron leadership of Israel has proved effective and many missile Hamas have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israelis dormirán more confident... for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Regarding diplomacy, United States is firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas of initiating the last wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Above all, Israel prospered. Especially under the government Benjamin Netanyahu, a first minister has ignored widely the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed a 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier dissolves West Bank, the main hunk of a territory would-be become state Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements which are increasing even though, under international law, are illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined a group line even more hard Iranian-led Avigdor Lieberman the run-up to elections the 22 January, is good position. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why coddling these clever Palestinians giving them own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If really ruled by, not dispararían rockets as have compatriots Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Is better taken after this wall and to a good blow if rose head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps prevail hard wing, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Although Islamists to take power and elsewhere Egypt not have much appreciate Israel, its priority will address the internal difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is greater than the its four Arab neighbours together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the superpower area hardly help new governments Arab improve their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire augurs well and could usher. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Also Israelis should think long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With elsewhere Arab becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians its right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox a day will explode at Israeli-occupied territories, this week exploded a bus Tel Aviv. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression is already undermining democracy on the state Jewish and demography worsens the situation as the population Arabic. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The harsh missions on Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas pay diplomatic a toll growing. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a nudge of outsiders the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The solution touting people remains sensible sides, most of the world foreign and this newspaper: two states and ceding territory Israel for safety reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Hope, small short-term the ceasefire give a little more impetus outsiders struggling. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, must start stop arms entering Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on borders 1967, with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem shared. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Arabs unrelated to the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This more the creation of a state Palestinian the imminent seeking a category of State virtual the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr Obama is also a important role in regard to achieve Israel to the table. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first mandate omitted present its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The White House, seems as reluctant to devote their attention. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This attitude is a deplorable vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A Middle East stable is of vital interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This implies a agreement Israel-Palestine peace. </seg>

<seg id="2298"> A world connected, is not badly aburrirse a little </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Over the yuletide of day Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had five p.m. in an airport because the plane where volábamos suffered a problem mechanical and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I had for consider boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Not I lying. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spending half-day a airport waiting for a flight is rather dull, even if you have means to be entertaining, as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But ever more academics and development experts childhood praise the blessings of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> According to them, is well, we and our children, we aburramos. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Aburrirse obliges the brain to find options interesting and can promoting creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Since, currently, most we are connected to this or the screen, not experienced the benefits boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> So should accept mood boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But, discuss it later. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Firstly, like many people, involved that, now have more time for leisure, boredom be a relatively recent phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But, as states Peter Toohey, Professor history Greek and Roman University Calgary, Canada, and author book Boredom &apos;: lively History&apos; (&apos;The boredom, a history animated&apos;) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &apos;De fact, history of boredom is very extensive&apos;, States. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Walls of Pompeii exist spraying of graffiti Latin on boredom from century R AD </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We must also consider how define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> &apos;the problem is is already earmarked and discussed very ways Eastwood&apos;, indicates John D., Professor of Psychology of the University of York Ontario Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After examination investigations published and raise the idea before a group of discussion formed per 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of &apos;wish, but, participate in a activity you full&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Says the gap between the boredom and apathy is person doing something but want to. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Points which with apathy there is the wish do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> Experience of boredom, States, is&apos; upsetting the process of attention, associated a low mood and a sense that time is slowly &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom may sound dreadfully like depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood says may be, people boring tend to see the problem as a issue of environment world or, those consider the problem depressed have. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes think we bored, when what happens is actually we problems for concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Its study Defining: &apos;The Unengaged mind Boredom on terms of attention&apos;, published the September the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and their colleagues deferred to a experiment previous the involved listening a thriller a person reading Article a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups listened room adjoining a television programme to all volume bore no relationship, others listened with the volume under, they hardly was perceptible, while the third group audio not heard the. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The Group listened the programme with volume showed more under boredom the other two groups; I cost concentrating, but not were certain why and attributed the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> &apos;When you try to concentrarte a task difficult or interesting altering attention can lead to boredom&apos;, indicated Mark J. Fenske, Professor University neuroscience Guelph, Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> &apos;For other hand, when you are doing something boring, as detect parts defective towards manufacture, a music you distract you can help aburrirte not&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> &apos;currently De fact, know to move or, action garabatos often interpret as sign boredom, may actually help combatted, already that make this person is physically more alert&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;show those children allowed move learn more and have more information those obliges them to be sitters&apos;, says the Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We all aburrirse sometime: late plane, a speaker monotonous, a film especially boring. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people have more tendency to aburrirse other. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To help measure, some researchers extraneous the 1980s a &apos;scale of trend the boredom&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes issues such as&apos; many of the things I have are repetitive and monotonous&apos; and &apos;there is so much interest me not have time of do everything&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology University West Florida,, using those scales, researchers have found boys have more tendency to aburrirse more often than girls, and specifically need more stimulation external and more varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But generally adolescents are a kind group weary rather easily. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> 1991, Reed Larson, Development Professor human and Community University of Illinois, carried out a experiment which represented contact with 400 adolescents and his parents between seven and eight times daily through a seeks. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Discovered the 32% of adolescents said to aburría while school or making duties, while 23% said to aburría when was not school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Furthermore, 3% of parents had they bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said not knew if percentages boredom current, 21 years after, would lower superiors or. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But said what knew was&apos; adolescence is a period where boredom reaches its higher inexpertly &apos;, largely because both children as adolescents are not given a great control over what want do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So, turning to my question of principle: is good aburrirse? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes it is not, since, led to extreme, could make we expose physical risks absurd, as do bets and fall consumption substances as method to combat it, as demonstrate investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Furthermore, many philosophers and writers speak the connection between the boredom and creativity, claims Professor Vodanovich, which has State studying this matter for more two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &apos;The boredom is the brain of say to should be doing else, &quot;says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology of New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain not always know what more appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you are boring and you this energy to touch the guitarra or cooking, this you will. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if are television, you satisfies short term, but long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> &apos;So, if your son is boring and I a iPad, already aburra not, but no learned to dilly-dally itself or to dosificarse&apos;, States Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And &apos;this capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations&apos;,. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your son not only learns to dilly-dally alone, but learns to be better controlled elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> Not really want praise the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But should not be too critical with him. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Our objective should be, rather the be comfortable paragraphs of persistent rumour activities and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &apos;A our view, need tiresome more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing as to link with something worth&apos;, States. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Points out what people really search is a way of disconnect and enjoy a time-out. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &apos;In a environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados&apos;, states, &apos;is difficult find ways of focus stops when noise&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Colorado: without instruction to the new law on consumption marijuana </seg>
