<seg id="250"> The new fee for carry-on baggage, luggage refers to in the upper storage area, so a small luggage under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Frontier says it will charge US $ 25, if the fee has been paid in advance, and $ 100 if passengers will pay to wait until arriving to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Frontier spokesman Kate O&apos;Malleyová stated that the passenger fee to encourage stodolarový to take care of the payment in advance. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;We chose this fee,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Airlines have begun to charge for the first and second from the luggage in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Passengers trying to avoid these charges and they hand baggage hidden in the storage space, as much as they could, so often lacking in this area. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Fees are one of the ways how to teach passengers to get on board to take fewer things. </seg>
<seg id="257"> O&apos;Malleyová said that the purpose of this new fee actually is not to get more money. </seg>
<seg id="258"> It&apos;s that the most loyal customers of Frontier is clearly expressed, that found a place in the upper storage area is increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers who have bought tickets on the website of the company, to pay. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This means that one passenger in the queue at the gate of the company Frontier may bring the baggage, which does not pay anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same luggage will pay $ 100. </seg>
<seg id="261"> O&apos;Malleyová said that the Web site and check-in procedures will be adjusted so as to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee prior to your arrival to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="262"> A new fee the company Frontier for hand luggage will not be in force before the summer, but the date has not been set yet. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Passengers often on the baggage fees and other charges, but complain about the airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Claims that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who require this service, would have to pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Many on Wall Street see the additional fee for baggage as a sign that the airline is trying to select enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Most but on the fees for carry-on luggage held. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Company Spirit Airlines carry-on luggage as the first zpoplatnila three years ago and another low-cost airline Allegiant Air her example later followed. </seg>
<seg id="268"> The only company, which also has such fees, is a Hungarian Wizz Air, says consultant in the field of air transport by Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional charges. </seg>
<seg id="269"> In its report of December 2011 estimated that the fee for carry-on luggage company Spirit will bring $ 50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Sorensen, a former Senior Executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with the company Spirit and wondering about what he saw at the gate, when the passengers met with an unusual fee the company Spirit for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="271"> &quot;Getting into the aircraft, it was the smoothest I&apos;ve ever seen in my career in the air,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I waited at the gate I see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels. </seg>
<seg id="273"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and in the blink of an eye&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="274"> Frontier also modeled after the company&apos;s Spirit will apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, may retain the entire Tin and coffee will be free. </seg>
<seg id="276"> The water will continue to be free. </seg>
<seg id="277"> US Airways, the company in 2008 briefly attempted to introduce charges for drinks, but after complaints from passengers about seven months later caved in, and no other significant airline it nenapodobila. </seg>
<seg id="278"> The last move the company to charge for carry-on luggage, the Frontier if the passenger&apos;s nezakoupí years directly from the airline, is her latest effort to steer customers straight to your website. </seg>
<seg id="279"> The airline pays Internet travel sellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="280"> It could be all the airline companies an incentive to lead passengers to buy directly from them, instead of trying to do it through Internet travel agencies. </seg>
<seg id="281"> However, the Frontier in this area, as far as it went. </seg>
<seg id="282"> In September, she began giving customers who bought through the Internet travel agency, just a half-mile under the loyalty program. </seg>
<seg id="283"> In the middle of ořízla reward for miles flown on 25 percent of the miles from the given path. </seg>
<seg id="284"> So the path with the company Frontier long 1000 miles purchased through the Internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Customers, the company also allows you to choose your seat in advance only in the event that the purchase made directly through the company&apos;s website Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Frontier has in his home town of Denver faithful customer base, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money. </seg>

<seg id="289"> We studied 11 thousand ADS! </seg>
<seg id="290"> Know where you want to work! </seg>
<seg id="291"> In November last year the analysis caught over 11 thousand advertisements offering work place, 4300 of them was published in the daily press and 6800 adverts (62 percent) on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="292"> The Internet is becoming the most important medium for the publication of offers of employment. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Even in 2005, when the survey took place for the first time, its market share was 26 percent. </seg>
<seg id="294"> In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) at about 60 percent. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Advertising jobs in pursuant to the analysis greatly reflects the current situation on the labour market. </seg>
<seg id="296"> An example might be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in the period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="297"> For example, in 2007, was in the same reference period published almost 25 900 ads, in the year 2012, it was less than half. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Offer jobs on the Internet is focused on a narrower, more in particular a qualified group of professions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> By contrast, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those blue-collar, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The rate of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media. </seg>
<seg id="301"> On the Internet caught the front places advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The position of the programmers or managers of small enterprises was featured only on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In the daily press is the proportion of these professions is significantly lower, in contrast, include in particular the representation of a large utility and labor occupations. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Among the most frequently given the requirements that employers expressed through advertising, of course, belongs to the menu training. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Other reference areas belonged to the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English. </seg>
<seg id="306"> In the daily press was the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language given in three percent of the advertisements, on the Internet at 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Only two percent of the advertisements employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages. </seg>
<seg id="308"> Claims for the &apos; computer literacy &apos; appeared in 40 percent of the advertisements (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent). </seg>
<seg id="309"> Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads. </seg>
<seg id="310"> The requirements to practice are generally associated with qualified professions. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In particular, the production manager, and other executives. </seg>
<seg id="312"> For blue-collar professions, in particular about the mechanics and the repairman or the manufacturer and processor of food products or repair of electrical equipment, said study author Georg Tillner. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Employers are also in the middle of their advertisements indicate requirements on the characteristics and skills of the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="314"> As the most commonly required skills in advertising in the first place no longer appear in the long term communication skills. </seg>
<seg id="315"> In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability. </seg>
<seg id="316"> A fifth shopping center is struggling with low attendance </seg>
<seg id="317"> It is clear from the data of the real estate consultancy company Cushman and Wakefield &amp; Jones Lang LaSalle. </seg>
<seg id="318"> In Prague&apos;s Bohnice opens to the public shopping center in Krakow, will be 19. Prague shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="319"> In the Czech Republic is now a total of 90 major business centres. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 percent of medium-sized and large center. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The main problems are inappropriately large Centre to the locality and the bad layouts, thus too much stories or complicated and disorganized arrangement of passages, or dead space center, &quot;said Michal Forging of Cushman Wakefield &amp;. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Also, according to the head of the Department of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about one-fifth of the business center struggling with low attendance. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Among the main reasons for include, inter alia. poor accessibility, low income category of local inhabitants or – has become a market in a given location. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Some of the projects were almost fully booked, but the results have been mostly disappointing at first. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Nowadays customers are somewhat conservative and are loath to change their shopping habits. </seg>
<seg id="326"> New business center must try to &apos; entice &apos; their customers on a new brand on the market, entertainment, service, and marketing actions, &quot;said Samadi. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The occupancy rate of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Sotáka, even some center rises, because the landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of the rent and dopronajmout some of the units. </seg>
<seg id="328"> &quot;But the truth is that recently opened, some of the projects that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy rate of decline (for example, Breda &amp; Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc, Czech Republic),&quot; he added As. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Shopping centre opened in the past two years on the market to promote according to Sylvie Samadi very slowly. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Place on the market for new projects but there are. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="332"> For example, in Prague, we see room for the construction of the project, which would have served the residents of Prague 6. </seg>
<seg id="333"> The market certainly is a space for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called &apos; convinience centres &apos;, focusing on shopping and service needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity, &quot;Samadi said. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Also according to Sotáka, there is a place on the domestic market for shopping centres. </seg>
<seg id="335"> And as for the small &apos; handler &apos;, so for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in the regional cities. </seg>
<seg id="336"> &quot;Cities as Kladno, České Budějovice, Plzeň, Brno or have room for further growth,&quot; he added As. </seg>
<seg id="337"> In Prague he sees room for the upcoming shopping center on Victory Square, then have it clear the potential Street Na Prikope and Wenceslas square. </seg>
<seg id="338"> &quot;Intensively developing the expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expansion into still smaller towns at favourable rents and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local settlement or shopping centers, respectively, their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of the home business Prior that benefit from good sites,&quot; added Dita Kaday of DTZ. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In the Czech Republic is currently placed 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross lease areas. </seg>
<seg id="340"> A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, there are nine in Prague, it follows from the information society, Incoma GfK. </seg>
<seg id="342"> In the number of shopping parks is the CZECH REPUBLIC below the EU average, in comparison with the values of the Kingdom and France is lagging behind the Czech Republic about 50 square meters per thousand of the population. </seg>

<seg id="369"> The Times won a copy of the magazine coming books and announced on Thursday evening that the President&apos;s top Associates organized at the end of the year 2011 intensive group meetings and surveys to estimate whether the deprivation is Biden would help revive Obama&apos;s fading hopes of re-election. </seg>
<seg id="370"> According to the national political correspondent for the Times Magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials in the campaign and in the White House, notably the former head of the Office of the White House Bill Daleyho, to measure what effect the move would have on the election of the former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Just a few of the closest presidential advisers--including Daleyho, former head of the Obama campaign, Jim Messina, and the former main advisors in the White House, David Axelroda and David Plouffeho – known to be considering this change. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The book &quot;Double down&quot; argue that Daley was representative of the efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that in the meantime, before eventually decided not to implement this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would be &quot;Obama&apos;s chances increase significantly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="374"> In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the Administration is really considered replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>

<seg id="381"> While Daley said that he did not think the President&apos;s potential changes &quot;was aware&quot;, former head of the Office admitted that it is &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew about it. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Martin said, adding that the book &quot;Double down&quot; definitely does not respond to the question of whether the political probe was given to Obama on the table. </seg>

<seg id="416"> The stimulus is the fact that the road trust fund financed by the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Americans do not buy as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Cars here a lot more miles on a gallon. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The federal tax of 18.4 cents a gallon, for the past 20 years has not increased. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Due to the current high price of gasoline, the politicians are reluctant to raise the tax on a single penny. </seg>
<seg id="421"> &quot;Gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy of the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="422"> His State recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to this tested system of payment per kilometre. </seg>
<seg id="423"> &quot;From a long-term point of view, it seems like the most logical alternative,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Experts call it the user fee by the number of kilometres travelled. </seg>
<seg id="425"> It is no surprise that this idea like urban Liberals, because taxes can be used to change patterns of behaviour of drivers, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and the creation of greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id="426"> California designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the ambitious goals set out in the law on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But the Republican Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee for transport, he said that it also sees it as a long-term alternative to nejfunkčnější. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Leaders of the free market from the Organization Reason Foundation are also in favour of the idea that drivers will pay for mileage. </seg>
<seg id="429"> &quot;It is not a tax, which disappear in a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, Vice President for strategy in the Organization Reason. </seg>
<seg id="430"> People pay directly for what they receive. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The initiative also supports the two former American Ministers of transport, who urged Congress in 2011, to be issued in the direction of paying per kilometre. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The US Senate last year approved a pilot project for US $ 90 million, which was to include about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Leadership of the House of representatives, however, rejected the proposal and did so due to concerns of rural legislators representing the residents, whose daily life often means to insult many miles for work outside the city. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Several States and cities, however, move forward on their own. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The most ardent is Oregon, which in the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="436"> These drivers will soon begin to pay state tax on mileage instead of gasoline tax. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Nevada already has completed the pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="438"> New York just project examines. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Illinois is trying to a limited extent for trucks. </seg>
<seg id="440"> I-95 and the Coalition, which includes 17 of the State ministries of transport, together with coastal States in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change. </seg>
<seg id="441"> This concept, however, is not just a supporter. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In Nevada, where the device was recently equipped with about 50 cars, the drivers were volunteers, the concern that the Government is able to track their every move. </seg>
<seg id="443"> &quot;Concerns about monitoring the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who leads the management of the strategy and the operation of the Nevada Department of transportation. </seg>
<seg id="444"> It was something people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="445"> How to test the project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on its website warned: &quot;it would be very easy to turn these devices on full tracking device.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="446"> There is no need to build an enormous dull technological infrastructure that will inevitably spread to record daily departures and arrivals of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Nevada is among the few States that are trying to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to keep track of how many miles the car runs, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="448"> If you can do it, said Khan, the public will be calmer. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The hunt for such technology has brought some of the State Agency for a small company in California called the True Mileage (actual distance travelled). </seg>
<seg id="450"> This company originally into action to assist the Government in the taxation of drivers involved. </seg>
<seg id="451"> She wanted to break through the emerging market liability insurance, where drivers pay based on how many here. </seg>
<seg id="452"> But this device, which tested, attracts the attention of designers of the road network, because it does not use GPS and provides only a limited amount of information, which are regularly recorded by using a modem. </seg>
<seg id="453"> &quot;People will be more willing to go, if you don&apos;t watch their speed and their location,&quot; says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of the True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="454"> In some of these pilot programs, many big mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="455"> They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with the fact that drivers make a choice. </seg>
<seg id="457"> They can choose a GPS device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Or you may not take any device and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the residents of the State. </seg>
<seg id="459"> In other places, hoping that a prudent public on this concept of proceeds, if the device will be able to more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the New York City traffic officials trying to develop the tax device, which would be equipped so that it was possible to pay extra fees for parking hours, to provide insurance according to the mileage and that garnered information about the speed of the other drivers, so motorists can avoid the traffic jam. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;Motorists are willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits that they offer,&quot; says design document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Some transportation planners, however, would like to know whether any discussions about paying per kilometre is not just a giant wildcard problem. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Officials from the Metropolitan Committee on transport in the Bay area of San Francisco say that Congress might have a problem with zbankrotovaným Road Trust Fund by raising taxes to solve very simply from the gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="464"> One-off or annual tax could be imposed on the driver of a hybrid or other cars that do not consume a lot of fuel, so that they pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;No radical surgery is needed when enough to take aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, Director of legislation and public affairs. </seg>
<seg id="466"> If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="467"> With a billionaire you call next year? </seg>
<seg id="468"> Kellner, owner of PPF group, wants to buy the operator O2. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Both companies confirmed the talks and according to various resources from agencies and from behind the scenes is said to have a hand in the sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Notification of the transaction should come in November, probably before the auction the frequencies for LTE network, i.e. before September 11. November. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Kellner Karel Komárek&apos;s own competitor group KKCG. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications began to auction frequencies for LTE network. </seg>
<seg id="473"> And to everyone&apos;s surprise, in the meantime, the taste of the company break into telecommunications. </seg>
<seg id="474"> But now leads a very experienced Sazka telecommunications veteran Robert Chvátal. </seg>
<seg id="475"> He started out as a marketing head of Radiomobilu (now T-Mobile), later became the Director of the Slovak T-Mobile and the last time that the head of the Austrian branch of the same operator. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Sazka plays several cards at once. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Signed up for auction and now admitted that Vodafone wants to run virtuála. </seg>
<seg id="478"> And it makes sense. </seg>
<seg id="479"> If the auction succeeds, to your network will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="480"> It would normally like, but Vodafone according to the information Of the newspaper, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competitive operators O2 and T-Mobile who will share their networks completely. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Vodafone so needs a partner. </seg>
<seg id="483"> And this may just be the Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="484"> If it succeeds in the tender for the LTE network (as a newbie can be purchased specially designed spectrum), Vodafone into the auction at all, or he might not listen to not mind the limited spectrum auctioning (not enough frequencies for all). </seg>
<seg id="485"> Vodafone, Sazkou of network may share. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Vodafone gets Sazka into its 2 g/3 g network (or newly built network of LTE at a frequency of 900 MHz), allowing the company a quick start on the network. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Sazka between starts to build a costly network of LTE, which will be able to use Vodafone. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Both can be satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="489"> The money saved would then Vodafone could spend some hard Internet provider or cable television. </seg>
<seg id="490"> And Kellner? </seg>
<seg id="491"> He would buy the O2 Czech and Slovak (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) was immediately a full fledged operator is still decent profits, and a wide range of services. </seg>
<seg id="492"> But on the other hand it is a great moloch, who will wait for the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="493"> In the auction network LTE would be gained for O2 and Kellner very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Both companies already have declared that the networks will share. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The auction could finally end in success, but probably not high enough amounts, which are enjoying the national budget. </seg>
<seg id="496"> And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic could choose between the calls with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellnerem or Komarek. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Or the two titans of the Czech business against global giants. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Greenpeace activists detained were flown to St. Petersburg in Russia </seg>
<seg id="499"> Environmental campaigners detainees since September in Russia due to a protest against planned to extract oil in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrograd. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Today, the Agency informed AFP, referring to the international environmental organization Greenpeace. </seg>
<seg id="501"> She also claims that the original accusation of its activists from piracy has not yet been downloaded. </seg>
<seg id="502"> &quot;Greenpeace International from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women in Russia, after a non-violent action against the oil rig in the Arctic, have been transported from the correctional facility in Murmansk to the prison in St. Petersburg,&quot; the organization said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="503"> The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; According to the DPA Agency was planned to move. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Authorities first accused the environmentalists of the piracy, which in the case of a conviction there for up to 15 years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="505"> But last week announced that this charge will replace the more moderate výtržnictvím, for which there is a lower penalty of a maximum of seven years imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Greenpeace in a statement today, but pointed out that the accusation of piracy, the authorities have so far downloaded, as promised. </seg>
<seg id="507"> It apparently means that the detention are now accused of two offences. </seg>
<seg id="508"> A powerful Committee of investigation announced last week that the accusation of piracy will replace accusations of disorderly conduct. </seg>
<seg id="509"> But when 30 prisoners appeared before the Committee this week, the charge of piracy could not be downloaded. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Instead, against each of the allegations was new, &quot;AFP quoted a statement from Greenpeace. </seg>
<seg id="511"> The Russians seized the oil rig company, Gazprom, in mid-September three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement originating in 18 countries. </seg>

<seg id="566"> Yesterday Obama from his original promise he. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance, they can leave,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="568"> With regard to what he called the &quot;turmoil in the media&quot; about the allegations, Obama called on Americans who received this notice, to the search for new insurance policies on the market. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even cheaper than expected. </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;You get a better offer,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="571"> His Administration argues that there should be no surprise that 5 percent of the population, that bought insurance for itself, it may be forced to change this program, because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the law on the available care. </seg>
<seg id="572"> &quot;I say that those Americans on the plane: you deserve something better,&quot; said Sebeliusová in his testimony before the Committee on energy and commerce in Washington. </seg>

<seg id="577"> More than three hours during a hearing on the question asked repeatedly Sebeliusovou, why the &quot;architect&quot; of the available care voluntarily gave up the Government-sponsored insurance program through the nezakoupil HealthCare.gov, that now makes millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Travels through the mud, the river and the jungle and provides medical care free of charge </seg>
<seg id="579"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Bwelle and his team treated almost every weekend hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="581"> In the countries of West Africa is not too many doctors; only one of 5 000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Vote here or through your mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes Award candidates for 2013. </seg>

<seg id="585"> The winner gets $ 250 000, in order to continue their extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="586"> For 21 years he watched his father Georges Bwelle as again and again falls into coma and goes to hospitals, which were not equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Jamef Bwelle was in 1981 near the Cameroon capital Yaounde injured in a car accident. </seg>
<seg id="588"> At first he was treated with only a broken arm, but he subsequently developed an infection that has spread to the brain, and there developed a hematoma that was challenges his whole life. </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; says Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="590"> We had to take him outside Cameroon, if we had the money. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Instead, he spent the years Bwelle by his father hauled into the crowded clinics and hospitals, where he got just such a treatment that was available. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="593"> You can leave the House at 5 in the morning, rush to the hospital, there was the first, but not the first. </seg>
<seg id="594"> There is a lot of patients. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Some people die just because they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Since 2002, when Bwelleho&apos;s father died, the situation has not changed too much. </seg>
<seg id="597"> According to the World Health Organization is in Cameroon, only one doctor at 5 000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor to 413 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="599"> And even if the doctor Kamerunci be able to visit, many would be unable to afford. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private. </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;The only problem, which is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="602"> With due to poverty they cannot enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="603"> When Bwelle saw his father and many of their countrymen suffer, decided to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have done last year, free 700 operations. </seg>
<seg id="605"> He became the physician of the vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="606"> And founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members at the weekend attending a rural area, where they provide medical care free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Since 2008, its group of volunteers have helped nearly 32 000 people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people napěchuje to supply, attached to the roof of the medical supplies and travel in the harsh terrain to villages in need of help. </seg>
<seg id="609"> It is not always accompanied by good luck. </seg>
<seg id="610"> More than once, the vehicle must push through the river and mud. </seg>
<seg id="611"> But when they arrive, they will be welcome as the real heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the community can offer. </seg>
<seg id="612"> In these villages is free medical care actually reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with a broad smile and unbridled energy-very willingly engages in the local merriment. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;On each quest we have 500 patients,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Come to the village from the circle of 60 miles, and walk away. </seg>
<seg id="616"> During each of these weekends doctors provide different health assistance. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, parasitic diseases, diabetes and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Others may get crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate free of charge – a document that calls for the school, but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="619"> In the evening, the team makes a simple operation under local anaesthetics. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The operation usually do in the school building, the town hall or at home; After the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room, to make room for the next patient. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Using light from a generator, operating room and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and its volunteers work into the wee hours. </seg>
<seg id="622"> It is exhausting, but the village musicians usually help team to lose motivation. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;To stay awake, and continued to work, playing on the drums all night,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="624"> On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired, but proud of his work. </seg>
<seg id="625"> This group--consisting of kamerunských physicians and foreign students of medicine--conducted last year 700 free operations and realizes that their aid may mean a lot for the local people. </seg>
<seg id="626"> One man said that after the operation of the hernia will be able to work again. </seg>

<seg id="870"> The Festival was founded and managed by Caroline Hirschovou, founder of the institution, Carolines comedy solo, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year--along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theaters. </seg>
<seg id="871"> &quot;Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the Club,&quot; said Hirschová. </seg>
<seg id="872"> This festival we created as an option, how to continue to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="873"> This year&apos;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykesové, Kathy Griffinové and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes&quot; (stand up for Heroes), the annual comedy benefit show musically at Madison Square Garden, where in addition to the other will be Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby. </seg>
<seg id="874"> As well as the spread of this festival, the spread and the world comedy. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Several comedians participating in this year&apos;s Festival came from non-traditional channels, such as show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX, and Spike. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Nick Kroll swung with his sitkomem (spicy cheerfully, &quot;League&quot; on fantasticko-football theme on the FXX) and now has her own comedy show on Comedy Central. </seg>

<seg id="879"> One of the biggest attractions of the Festival will interview: David Steinberg will talk with Larry David. </seg>

<seg id="889"> Other gentlemen showed mainly their weaknesses. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Senator Dienstbier is consistent and readable and unusable, He is Vice-Chairman of the most impossible interview on television. </seg>
<seg id="891"> On this basis, I see no better option than to the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS proposed for the Prime Minister, the Vice-President of the Senate Gajdůškovou that one should not start a handicap, and I think that has done standard performance. </seg>
<seg id="892"> This is as good a solution, that hardly anyone from the management. </seg>
<seg id="893"> I add that this solution is the only way to forget what they did, and continue without bursting. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Alena Gajdůšková, could safely build a minority Government with just a blessing from the President of the Grupo popular Babiš and without apologized, but Minister of health Hovorkou, which is actually a faithful Social Democrat. </seg>

<seg id="1052"> Aircraft manufacturers disagree on the width of the seats at stake are large orders </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft with the dispute about the width of seats in 2nd class on long distance flights, which this month occasioned a bitter exchange of views at the air show in Dubai. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class – not just the one which would have usually preceded the airlines, but for which the allocated space is the key to the demands on the efficiency of the companies for the last aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but the main American rival Boeing says that they have to decide about the airline. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The dispute arose at a time when manufacturers compete in the sale of the biggest version of the twin-engine long-range aircraft with his potential record number of orders as expected during events from 17. into the 21st century. November. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> How is the rear part of the aircraft spread over--especially if it is side by side 9 or 10 seats--is the basis of economic performance claims, proposals for new aircraft &quot;mini-jumbo&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> Boeing says that the improved model &quot;777X&quot; carry 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spaced 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> Airbus says that the competitive version of its model A350 will take 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats allocated after 9. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The giant aircraft often attack each other in technical issues through ads in professional media. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X Gets the edge with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Recently, tentatively showed what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, when financiers showed the slide showing three people crowded in the restaurant with the headline &quot;Let you enjoy it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1063"> &quot;Boeing promotes long-haul flights, in seats closer than they are in the regional turbo-prop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales Chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> How to change návky, people are eating more, but seats in aircraft are radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Since the beginning of the 70 &apos;s. years ago, when Boeing 747 jumbo has defined the modern long-distance air transport, to the turn of the century, according to the data of the Ministry of health, the US weight average American aged 40 to 49 years of age increased by 10 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> According to the American health statistics has the average American in the 21st century. century, 100 cm in the waist. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Airbus contends that his rival holds the concept of 50 seats. years ago, when the average width of the seats of the newly pokřtěného aircraft was lower. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Airbus claims that the company has conducted research which suggests that seat about 2.5 cm extension will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The dimensions of the seats of the Boeing Airbus refuses and says that it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airline fees and equipment exports. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> &quot;Really it&apos;s about to give airlines flexibility and allow them to do things they believe, that is a must do in order to be successful,&quot; said an expert on the cab area of Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> They don&apos;t want us to them than what they gain. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> It is essential for the passengers more space for the elbows, but the vendor is a growing problem that can affect yields. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> For this dispute is a race in orders for aircraft with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth of at least $ 700 billion at catalog prices, enough to shift the balance of American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> As stated in July, Reuters, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the latest battle between aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Both Airbus and Boeing argue that reaching for their most recent long-haul twin-engine aircraft designs by 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment, the model of the Boeing 777-300ER simulators with 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Performance claims Boeing partly depends on the comparison of the design of the model 777X with 10 seats in a row and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Profit in the unit cost is compared to the 10sedadlovému concept of a weakened. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> &quot;The reason that Boeing does is to stuffed it more seats, and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head for the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> On the other hand, analysts say, that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in accordance with the fact that many passengers for denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Forty-two inches wide seat for passengers would be great, but the reality is that from a business point of view the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat model, the 777,&quot; said an expert on the Interior of the cabin, Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the portal Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Airbus and Boeing are not seats, but offer the airlines of the catalogue of suppliers to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Scestovalí aircraft dealers even carries the measuring zone to examine the competitive arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offers aircraft with highly dense arrangement for low-cost carriers and regional travelers. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The Airbus A350 model offers 10 seats in a row, but says he wouldn&apos;t sell it yet. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Recently, Airbus has stressed the need for greater editing booths, offered on some of its aircraft, a wider seat in the aisles. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Experts say that without the support of a single large modern aircraft manufacturer further prompted to new industry standards will remain, but they can discourage sales of wool 777X. </seg>

<seg id="1098"> How much savings affect the Czech Republic, where the Group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for domestic television&apos;s &apos;&apos; TV Nova, yet is not. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> &quot;It is premature and we really can&apos;t comment on it,&quot; said Communications Director Nova Josef Koukolíček. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> According to the information MINISTRY today, significant layoffs are inevitable, but the Czech Republic is certainly by far the greatest impact this should have on the staffing levels of branches of CME in Romania and other countries. </seg>

<seg id="1103"> Google, Samsung and Huawei sued Nortel due to patents </seg>
<seg id="1104"> The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct company Nortel, filed Thursday in a lawsuit for patent infringement against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company, which přelicitovala during the auction within bankruptcy company Nortel. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> A consortium of Rockstar, which has purchased Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion, with the u.s. Circuit Court of zažalovalo in Texas Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringement. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> The company Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Google is accused of violating seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> The patents cover technology, which helps you to combine search terms on the Internet with an advertisement, says the lawsuit, which is the core of the search business to Google. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Representatives of the companies, Samsung, Huawei, HTC, and Rockstar were not immediately available. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufactured phones, which operate on Google&apos;s Android operating system, which competes with mobile products by Apple and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> In 2011, Google has made for patents the company Nortel default quote of $ 900 million. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Google increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $ 4.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> Then he was in the fight of Nortel patents defeated by Rockstar, earned $ 12.5 billion, Google, Motorola Mobility, which was partially motivated by the trade group, Motorola&apos;s patents. </seg>

<seg id="1116"> George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots on the selection </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Another day, another creepy story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> This time it appears warning that the condition for membership of an independent Scotland within the EU would be his entry into the Schengen area. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> This occasioned for stories on passport checks in Berwick and ostnatém wire along Hadrian&apos;s wall. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The truth is that newspapers have reported the possible economic benefits of Strathclyde freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, but – as you might expect – it did not translate into the headlines of newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> No one mentioned that the EU Member States spend the amount of time by adapting its official laws, if it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Whereas, now that Scotland is not in Schengen, the offer of ongoing non-compliance would be for Brussels cheap concession in return for anything from the Scots really want. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> So it&apos;s a pretty weak story. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> And, moreover, so old that it became obsolete. Canard that &quot;independence is passport control&quot;, I&apos;ve heard from at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Yet this bearded story hides one interesting idea. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Why should they ever have expected that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Why replace the collar for the Brussels London, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1128"> This is the real story: the great European postwar plan to unite Europe finally failed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> The influence of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Across Europe are gaining influence party dedicated to resistance to the abolition of the EU or the euro as a common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Even in Germany much Euro-skeptical party alternative for Germany-based this year--came out of nowhere and already in September&apos;s federal election she captured nearly five million votes from the Bundestag, thereby essentially &quot;vymetla&quot; free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats). </seg>
<seg id="1132"> On the domestic front has always been a resistance to a plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Efficiency which is dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the navléknutou on the straightjacket of the national economy through adherence to a common currency have led many people to believe that the project Europe has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national Government is running a high budget deficit – it was only true in the case of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> Rather, it is about the euro system, which blocks their members on exchange rates favorable for German exporters – and that&apos;s the German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency to southern Europe in the area of domestic production compared to the disadvantage of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> The only use is to cut income and public spending – which encourages the Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of languid performance. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> As a result of the &quot;green&quot; energy policy supported by Brussels – code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of the consumer – the European industry twice more for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> This is paralyzing the disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Not all of the freezing of salaries in the world, made his mark in the European petrochemical industry zadupání cheap slate oil from the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> The result is a smoldering revolt, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will rein in Germany and to Paris to stand up in the world on the level of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> Berlin but Paris doesn&apos;t need political legitimacy as the pass and pushed through in Europe with its own economic policy and worn the French economy left to their fate. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> The result: Marine Le Pen, the right-wing, anti-European national front, won the crucial additional options and postponed the ruling Socialists to the third place. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> The queue is now with 24% of the votes as the most popular party in France--an early warning for the British Labour that they cannot conclude that fission right will automatically be positively reflected on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> How Le Pen loaded with his newly acquired popularity among the white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1149"> In the European elections next year would like to use to across the European Parliament created the antievropský block of acting against the common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If you keep these parties anti-European election well, which is likely, such a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament to dominate. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> I think that in the foreseeable future is the growing protievropský feeling and stance against the common currency and the euro will destroy. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> The EU will not disappear, but rather transformed into something freer in the meaning of &quot;Europe (sovereign) of Nations&quot;, General de Gaulle preferred. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Germany and several of his satellite might leave the euro&apos;s economies, but France and southern Europe restores its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I expect that the United Kingdom from this project will be to distance itself and přimkne to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> However, increased interest in Washington about the Pacific suggests that the Kingdom will be left the Atlantic cold. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And where is Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> We can choose to be areas (in principle) the little England. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Or we can defend their own economic interests – it is even the possibility to notify Brussels, Berlin and, when they leave us be. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I assume that Scotland would be in a relaxed sequence Europe performed well, provided that it kept its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be simpler in non-federal Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain their economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> The SNP Government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful — — political movement lack the austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opozičnímu position against the cuts, which had planned (and implemented) Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservatives and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> It would be ridiculous, if Scotland voted for independence now just to adopt austerity measures were dictated by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> The parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate gender&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Germany became the first European nation which recognises a third gender in children born with ambiguous sexual devices. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Newborn children will no longer be sorted only to either the male or the female gender. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The new law does not require from the parents for such children have any sex, and allows them to their native worksheets include gender as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to your child, rashly decided for the operation for the purpose of determining sex, and the fight against discrimination against those who are intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Intersexual person according to the BBC one after many years, she said: &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1173"> Wallis Simpson could be intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Determining gender is still not fully understood, but most experts in the United States says that when you cannot determine the sex, it&apos;s better to use the best available information and identify them, instead of waiting and watching, the psychological and physical development of the child in the meantime before the operation executes, if at all. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> New York psychiatrist Jack Drescher, a doctor who specializes in problems with specifying gender, said that the new German law &quot;looks like a good thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Intersexual children represent the ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> &quot;Some people are in life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children this is not so,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Sex determination can be done without surgery, and then can wait how identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> Knowing how your child develops a gender, not too accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> No one can answer the question, why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> It&apos;s like a mystery, why are some people gay. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> A message transmitted to the European Committee in 2011, described the intersexual people as distinct from the transsexuálních or transgenderových people, because their status is not bound by gender, but on their biological structure, which is not exclusively or male or female, but typically consists of both and it cannot be clearly defined as not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> These features may occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as the muscle volume, the scalp, the bust and the figure in the primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, and also the level of harassment, violence and prejudice. </seg>

<seg id="1188"> According to the Ministry of the Interior will have German passports in addition to M (male) or F (female) and a third designation, X for intersexual people. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> In neighbouring France, according to news reports on France 24 gender issues are still controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> In 2011, the dozens of French legislators from the countries have signed a petition to the heavily Catholic, that of school textbooks was removed &quot;gender theory&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The American Web site Catholic online to the German law also defined and wrote: &quot;with the way the world is being dragged to a new State where sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity, we twist the inside out two more pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1192"> One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also said for Baby zone, they would prefer to see children assigned sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> &quot;Parenting itself is stressful, even without the additional restrictions, especially if you don&apos;t know the sex of your child,&quot; for Web sites relating to parental care. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, and according to a handsome River, which had a dual sex. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> And about ten years back to the medical community believed that gender is something like a whiteboard, which can erase and redraw again. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> But now many are questioning the ethical base of operations with the understanding that gender is a complex matter and doctors may sometimes decide incorrectly, because they don&apos;t know how due to their gender, children feel when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> &quot;In the mid-20th century. century called it a psychiatric emergency room, &quot;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> When these children were born, they haven&apos;t called you&apos;re a psychiatrist, but a surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Persistent theories about how to treat children with ambiguous sex, was presented by Dr. John Moneyem at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is pliable. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Created a new concept of &quot;gender competence&quot; and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how parents raised their child--operated on the baby&apos;s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether it was identified as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> But in one case from the year 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan&quot;, his theory became controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly performed circumcision, recommended that her child had completely removed and castrate his testicles and raised him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> &quot;The media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> When the boys were 15 years old, he přeoperovat back on the boy and married with a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 38 years, however, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Drescher said that some doctors &quot;this model use&quot; today. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> But in the 1990s. years, with the advent of the Internet, with the survivors of these operations have discovered the &quot;unhappy with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1209"> It was a case of Jim Bruce, 36letého writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but ambiguous sexual devices. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> The doctors were not sure whether the large clitoris or small penis, and were convinced that the man could never live &quot;life satisfaction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> And so shortly after his birth in 1976 were Bruce surgically removed external authorities and testicles and was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> In the 12 years he got female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> &quot;I knew that I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask. </seg>

<seg id="1223"> But Anne Tamar-Mattisová, Director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (supporters of an informed choice), based in California, is concerned that the German law &quot;calls for calibration and stigmatům&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> &quot;Many of the activists are worried that German law accomplishes that will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose for the child &apos; indeterminate &apos;,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> We&apos;re afraid that it prompts for intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But we don&apos;t know how the law eventually will ring, so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Tamar-Mattisová said her organization supports the Australian law because it &quot;allows the adults to choose to be included in the third gender&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> &quot;An adult should be able to make legally valid sex their own decisions,&quot; she said. </seg>

<seg id="1234"> Baratzové &apos;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has the DSD called insensitivity syndrome on androgens. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Because of its androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>

<seg id="1237"> Katie 29letá is now married and in the framework of the studies at the University of Pennsylvania is working as an intern at a children&apos;s psychiatric ward. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Although it is barren, he hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> &quot;The law gives parents some leeway to make his decision to them,&quot; said Baratzová. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It gives them time to perform certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In this respect, everything is OK – you educate your child and you love it. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> You have an amazing baby and we celebrating for. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> You don&apos;t have to rush with the operation, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;It brings the opportunity to participate in decision-making and the baby and takes away the anxiety that parents&quot; because they don&apos;t have confidence that they are doing the right thing, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Finally, the child decides how the sex is more identified – and it is a great thing. </seg>

<seg id="1258"> Karel Uhlířský vrch-Drábek: one of our youngest volcanoes. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> Uhlířský vrch is a conspicuous Hill, 3 km southeast of Bruntál. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Along with several other is evidence of volcanic activity in the low Jeseník in time (from the geological point of view) recently. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The last eruption here were still at the beginning of the Quaternary. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> When viewed from a distance is on the top of Uhlířského Hill, the striking white-plastered the Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary, built in the years 1755-1765. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Replaced the original wooden Chapel of pilgrimage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The Inn, which stood next to the Church, got involved. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Shortly after the completion of the Church was planted by an alley of four rows of Linden trees, about 1 km long. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Way of the cross on the Hill Uhlířském is already the third version, the original here was after 1916, the second, in 2001, lasted only until 2004. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The fifteen stations are wooden sculptures by local artist-Carver František Lal N. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> He used a variety of tree species in the area of the low Jeseník. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Similarly, the base of the rocks of the area are interesting geological exposure. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> At each stop and the name of the sponsor. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Uhlířský vrch is the rest of the young volcano. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Although the data from the radiometrických measurement of the age of the somewhat different, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Pinball Volcano (0.8 million years old). </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The volcano was born. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> A considerable amount of volcanic ash ejected along with fragments of rocks from the bedrock, that burning have reddish brown in color. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> At the end of this phase, spilled on the surface of the lava-today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The second eruption ejected red, Red-Brown and black tuffs. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Their coat is powerful up to 50 metres and her part is accessible in the wall of the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> In tufech are prominent volcanic bombs up to 1 meter large. The second eruption was topped off with the release of lava. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> At the conclusion of the activities of the volcano spilled lava, which today consists of up to 50 m mighty struskovitého basalt layer. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The volcano, which replaces the vyvrhování volcanic ash with the discharge of lava are the most common type of volcanoes. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Because they are actually composed of layers, were given the name of stratovolcanoes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The original volcanic cone has been subject successively erosion. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> At risk, however, was up to the extraction of rocks in the quarry on the South side. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> The most intense quarrying took place here in the years 1953-1962. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Tuff is added to the concrete, which was lighter and had a better thermal insulating properties. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The extraction was under pressure from experts and the public to stop and thus preserve this unique place. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> The problem is, however, porosity and small rocks, which quickly cohesion zvětrávají, crumbling and sesouvají down the slope. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> The quarry so relatively quickly disappearing. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> To make matters even more complicated, it&apos;s a warm, South-facing slope ideal for some rare species of plants and animals. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> The axle is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a distinctive geological profile. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> It&apos;s nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites. </seg>

<seg id="1308"> Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for that, compiled by explosive devices, which have been used in the bombing. </seg>

<seg id="1311"> He was also found guilty in several other terrorism-related counts, including a series of bombings at churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The prosecution demanded a life sentence, although it could insist that the man with the nickname &quot;Demolition man&quot; (bourač) due to its reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives, got the death penalty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> This decision again has revived painful memories of June Corteenové, the mother from Perth, who, when a devastating attack by running Patekem and other osnovateli almost ten years ago lost their 39letá twins Jane and Jenny. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> With tears in her eyes she said, Feet should be sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> I really think that should follow in the footsteps of the others. </seg>

<seg id="1321"> Mr Hughes said that should meet Pateka the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell responsible for the massacre I Džamá – Amroziho, Muchlase and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> This guy should get the death penalty as a nobody. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> Keep him alive ... no reason to hold him still alive, just not. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Get 20 years for that, 202 people killed and hundreds of others wounded, again not so much. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> He stood before the court Friday as the last of the bombers in Bali. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> He avoided arrest for nearly ten years, but eventually he was caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, u.s. forces killed the former leader of Al-Qaeda&apos;s Osama bin Laden. </seg>

<seg id="1333"> Pope Francis called in February the first Cardinals </seg>
<seg id="1334"> On Thursday, the Vatican announced that the Pope Francis 22. February, for the first time called the new cardinals of the Catholic Church. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The Cardinals are in the Catholic Church&apos;s clergy have the highest position after the Pope and the Pope are the ones who vote, so Francis said his first group of men who will choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> It is now 201 Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80 years, cannot participate in the election of the Pope – the group is reduced to 120 opting for Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> In a statement notifying the father Federico Lombardi this message, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the ceremony elevating new cardinals will be held meeting of the current Cardinals, known as konzistorium. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> &quot;The Pope, František decided to communicate its decision to convene February konzistorium in advance, in order to facilitate the planning of the other Assembly, which require the participation of the Cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of Cardinals opting to February is likely to fall. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> He said that the Pope usually appoints as many Cardinals, how many it is necessary that the number of constituencies increased again to 120, and so many Cardinals over age 80 years, how much he wants. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Konzistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> At this point, manifested a certain orientation on Europe, Europe and especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> &quot;It will be interesting to watch whether the new Pope nominates Cardinals from the rest of the world, in order to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Forty percent of Roman Catholics is in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> It will also be the first choice of Cardinals ever since, what Francis instituted the Council of Cardinals, the Group of eight Cardinals from around the world, that he gave the task of finding ways to reform the Church. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In the past, the Pope ruled everything for himself. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> &quot;Now, Francis chose these eight Cardinals to help him,&quot; said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> He said that it is &quot;quite possible&quot; that the Cardinals the Pope asks for advice. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In this situation we were before – it is a complete novelty. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Valero said that the Popes traditionally povyšovali to the position of the Cardinals to the Bishops of the big sites, but Francis is &quot;full of surprises — so we don&apos;t know who&apos;s name&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1374"> American commandos in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The Israelis showed exactly how you want to look like the bombing of Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Without unnecessary hype, threats and statements sent aircraft million, you hit the target, and back. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Without a lulled the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The entire action of refusing to confirm and do not express it. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The exact opposite of a confused and grandiose, the acts of the Obama administration&apos;s enforcement of the Syrian policy. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> And the most satisfying on the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Don&apos;t be fooled by the media of their allegations that the bombed Syrian &quot;base&quot; or &quot;Hizbaláh&quot; supplies. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> I recently wrote here about the fact that while u.s. aid secular insurgents in the country remains only on the rhetorical level, Russia supplied weapons on Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> And a fresh shipment of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latákija has become the target of the Israeli raid. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> A clear message. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> And note, Israel again bombed Asadův mode, not the insurgents, although according to the popular Internet theories should be vice versa. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The u.s. Government honored 2 spaciálních units, probably members of Delta force. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> Netušilo, so far, that have distinguished themselves during the attack on the American Consulate in Bengází. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is known for the heroic death of two former national SEALs, who defended the CIA&apos;S campus in the city, according to me it was the members of secret commandos the CIA, which is made up of former soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> It has been speculated for a long time, what did the SEALs at the Consulate or even in a residence located elsewhere the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Now it is clearer. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya kulometnými protected nests (just on one that both members of the SEALs have perished after the intervention of minometem), it is quite surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> But even more surprising are the information about those two yet unknown heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> They were part of the American commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as they got a report on the attack in the Bengází has voluntarily signed up for the intervention and, along with five private contractors shot their way into the complex&apos;s CIA in the Bengází. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The Obama administration shoots itself by the fact that during that attack wasn&apos;t it officially deployed and the entire squad and that he simply hesitated what to do. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The Commander of the commando, apparently released without these volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Anyway, that operating in the country not once, but permanently American commandos, the CIA and the private kontraktoři is quite interesting information. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> And whereas, until recently officially no such thing but never acknowledged and even now only talks about some sort of advisory mission to NATO in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> But it is good that the US although half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Even if the situation is to resolve the nationwide that want to help a lot more. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> The last place a secret and permanent conflict, of which today I want to write is the coast of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Not so long ago, the media almost she carried on about the Iranian air force for the prosecution of us completely. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Little is known, however, how the Americans their drones effectively protects. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Of course, if you happen to be able to discover your dron in the airspace, you can&apos;t do anything with it. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> However, if discovered by the Iranians in the area of international dron, the situation is completely different. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom persecuted American International dron space above the sea when there was maybe the first deployment of American super sharp fighter F-22 Raptor in history. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The podletěl Phantoma to optically verified its armament, without him the Phantom has registered on the radar or it&apos;s just noticed and then when suddenly appeared to him and urged the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened to without complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> No wonder, when the Phantom is an American production, which, however, remembers the Vietnam war. </seg>

<seg id="1427"> CDC published by Center for the school of the directive as regards allergies in children </seg>
<seg id="1428"> In the middle of the Center for disease control and prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines to help in the case of children&apos;s food allergy in school. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> This is the first set of these directives, which the u.s. Government has released, and it&apos;s due to the fact that the number of school-age children, who suffer from allergies to food, are rising. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> One of the 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> Center of the CDC revealed that the incidence of food allergies in children increased between 1997 and 2007, about 18 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> The directive contain information for schools about how to inform staff and faculty about children&apos;s allergies to foods and how to an allergic reaction, if it occurs, to respond. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> It also recommends that schools have available epinephrine – most commonly used auto injector EpiPen brand – to be capable of responding to a potentially life-threatening allergy. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The State Legislature recently updated rules that schools allow you to store the adrenaline easier. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> The report also contains a list of typical symptoms emerging in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>

<seg id="1437"> As the Tipsport () erases personal data. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> More than a year ago, I made the Tipsport.cz website to register. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> I&apos;m here but subsequently did not finish because of the branch was just someone who couldn&apos;t complete the registration from the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> And because I didn&apos;t want to go to another branch, registration has plummeted, then I moved and I changed the address and number of the identity card. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> When I wanted to complete your registration at a later date, I was told that it can&apos;t, because I have another ID, address and that it simply is not complete, and I ask for the deletion of data and perform a new registration. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> So I did and it 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I ask for the deletion of all their personal data from the database according to the current law on personal data protection. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On duhý day I wrote that I have a technical support to complete your registration at the branch. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> This began Marathon e-mail technical support, where finally after 4. urganci 25.10. they wrote that personal data deleted at my request. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> One would therefore have said that could make the new registration, and here again the problems began as soon as I wrote that my user name is already taken (I understand has not been deleted-this is not a personal statement, but eventually retired and this). </seg>
<seg id="1446"> So I used a different user name and jumped out at me that my personal data are already stored, to complete the registration at the branch (as may have saved something to argue that clear?), so I again contacted technical support. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> To my question how it is possible to spoil me, that personal data is actually erased 25.10. and so I sent an email with that error. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> This I did (yesterday around 15 hours) and on it wrote off me today that I have registered the same day (31.10.2013) in 13.21 and that, therefore, it is not because I used the same name and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> What about that technical support contact is already a week and I am having with them that it still isn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> And what about that if it was true what they claim (like not) would not be able to register one with the same name or the same date of birth, if this is registered. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> Just by the way in those I actually registered 13.21, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number, and wonder of wonders, it appeared to me that the page was sent to me at the e-mail link to complete the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> How is it possible, when they cannot be registered under the same name and date of birth? </seg>
<seg id="1453"> Probably because the Tipsport binds the registration on the email and phone number and the date simply has not surrendered as they claim. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So I again said technical support simply lie (either deliberately or they don&apos;t know what they write), because that what they write is true. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> I have several screens that showed the problem with registration was before 31.10. so &quot;fake&quot; registrations on this simply has no effect. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> To me the stark sentence-Tipsport wrote back, I&apos;m sorry, but the fact that you&apos;ve already registered, we can&apos;t check again your claim. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> And communication has ended. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Repeat the same sentence over and over, respectively, that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> They can&apos;t even accept the fact that the registration has not been completed by clicking on the link in the email and then actually did not. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> If I summarize it, then, that not only nevymazal the Tipsport data as they claim, but still he&apos;s lying when he claims the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> The worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and trying to make it appear that the bug is on the side of the customer. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> By the way after putting this on my personal blog things a bit in motion and the technical support of e-mail transmitted to examine the matter and informed (after a week of haggling and a reminder and warning to the same mistake). </seg>

<seg id="1485"> Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed light-emitting titbit. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The idea came when he read the professional discourse on a jellyfish, and convinced the scientists in China to chemically produced protein that causes the light. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes her to radiation. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Chris says that ice cream is lit when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and therefore the more suck, the more clearly. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company &quot;Lick me I&apos;m delicious&quot; (lick me taste great), says: &quot;it&apos;s amazing stuff, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of the substance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1490"> The protein, which we use in ice cream, it reacts with your language at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> So how does your mouth heat increases the protein level of pH and the ice cream begins to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> We tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween, because it causes this fantastic bright effect. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> Is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made, because the luminous jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> And so each scoop is about 140 GBP. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> But it tastes great. </seg>

<seg id="1551"> Place the post-electoral Sirloin post-election goulash </seg>
<seg id="1552"> The October elections rather than the winner brought a bunch of losers. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> It&apos;s not just the parties in the Chamber of deputies or not (eg. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, eventually, the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS because of their internal divisions. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Policymakers festive Sirloin instead of naservírovali us on the weekend after the stew. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> &quot;The election has become a movement of Andrei Babiš, which promised the voters to change the political style of governance. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The fragmentation of the election outcome and schism in the winning side of the loading of the political (from) will Mr. President Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters who the party which the President publicly supported Zeman, nor did the Chamber of Deputies. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The President is due to unpleasant events lost ahead of other strategic policy, but there are still a few ways to get it back-for example, by selecting a future Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> While the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS had chance to obtain the Premiership in my eyes away, entrepreneurs, Babišovi Andreju. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Post-election developments, although not yet a mile away early and smooth to create a stable Government, but compared with the pre-election scenario the Government supported by the Communists, the left-wing SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, this is development for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy had better news. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Due to the loud opposition SO put together with the ODS and TOP 09, is still the most probable variant of the coalition of the Social Democrats, and Christian Democrats (a total of 111 members). </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Due to the split in the Social Democrats, which will thus become unreadable and weak ground in negotiations, the result may be quite daunting for the coalition negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> A minority Government, the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS made up with &quot;nezemanovců&quot; on the Castle probably does not pass. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> In addition, any Government, to which the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS will participate, will be vulnerable to unmet aspirations of many of the Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to a further split in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Therefore, I ask myself: &quot;Nespějeme by gravity to the other early elections?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> The other choice would have been rather a referendum on the mandate of the voting strength of the movement. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> The SOCIAL DEMOCRATS on the implementation of the sectoral plans, taxes, more tax increases of income or the State Bank building fell hopefully under the table. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The CSSD, KDU-CSL, and dawn agree, for example, on the contrary, the promotion of entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, reducing the lower rate of VAT for the selected item. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> The friction surface, most occur in the perspective of social policy and the size of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> YES, but now has the upper hand, so the program so far, the most likely Coalition Yes, the CSSD, KDU-CSL, leaning more to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Which from my perspective is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything in the economy is still moving. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic was early elections. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> As reasons were cited corruption, wasting money on overpriced purchases and state contracts, tax increases, and last but not least, Government scandals. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> According to the results of elections, you can infer that most of the citizens of this State. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> It actually didn&apos;t matter and that there was a status (pilferage and indebtedness of the State), were actually satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Otherwise, you can&apos;t really explain, that 3 413 497 voters there to vote, the electorate voted TOP 357 596 09 384 174 voters voted for the ODS and a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original Coalition, which represents a 52,16% of all legal voters. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Which is an absolute majority. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> When the above parties I&apos;ll tack 1 016 829 voters CSSD, then to the old order (because all the parties involved in the &quot;theft&quot; and the indebtedness of the State), then this State actually agreed 64,23% legal voters. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> This actually a majority of voters indicated that they are not for punishing culprits rozkradení and over-indebtedness of the State. </seg>

<seg id="1593"> Scientists more throw light on how the movements of the tail is connected with the mood of the dog </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Earlier research has shown that dogs wag a tail are more to the right (from the perspective of a dog), while nervous dogs tail waving largely left. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can do these subtle differences in the movement of the tail of the log and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, Pasko of the University of Trento said: &quot;for the people, it is well known that the left and the right side of the brain have different binding to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1597"> It&apos;s the same thing we tried to pick out other species. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> He added that, as is the case with people, even in dogs is on the right side of the brain responsible for the left-hand motions and vice versa and that these two hemispheres are playing a different role in the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> In an effort to get more information about how the dogs respond to asymmetrical wagging the tail of the other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals watched movies about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Measured heart rate of these animals and have analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Will probably not be long before we understand why it is their tail, sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We Have dogs, movies about dogs – whether in the natural version, or in the form of silhouettes – to get rid of any confounding stimuli, and we were able to also adjust the movement of the tail and show him more right or left.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1603"> When the animals saw the otherwise bland dog move his tail to the right (from the perspective of a dog&apos;s tail, vrtějícího), remained perfectly calm. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> But when shooting noticed the tail mostly left (again from the perspective of a dog&apos;s tail, vrtějícího), their heart rate increased and the animals, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Professor Vallortigara said he doesn&apos;t think that the dogs through these movements consciously interacted with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Rather believes that the dogs have learned from experience that moves you must and does not need to be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He said: &quot;If you meet several times with dogs and move their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to the rather friendly behavior and move right engenders less friendly behavior, you respond on the basis of this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1608"> The researchers say that the findings may be the owners of the dogs, veterinarians, and cvičitelům to help better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, lecturer at the University of Bristol, beasts of burden, he said, that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln, found that the dogs turned his head to the left when watching an aggressive dog, and on the right, when you look at the happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> And in another professional treatises from the University of Victoria in Canada, said: &quot;the dog robot dogs more likely to be present when shaking his tail to the left than to the right, when it became rather uncertain — exactly the opposite of the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The difference may be, according to him due to the fact that the dogs in these various studies of animals in the movies or canine robots exactly quite as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> He explained that could help the study of how the dogs react to real dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> &quot;Although in the case of many different mammals, there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details are still to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> But given how simple it is to record their behavior will probably not be long before we understand why it is their tail, sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other. </seg>

<seg id="1937"> All this culminated when the Mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned on the Court due to the undemocratic and compiling lists. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> Actors cases to yet they too express to the party before the election to avoid even more. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> But now votes are tallied. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The leadership of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS immediately in Ostrava Monday evening called on the Mayor of Ostrava that he stepped out of the party, and will probably push even to lose its function. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Petr Kajnar but wants to fight on. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> What&apos;s in dispute and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive interview for the journal. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> How do you perceive the outcome of elections? </seg>
<seg id="1944"> The SOCIAL DEMOCRATS will surely provide a much better result. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> It is detrimental to us, that before the election address in the media disputes inside the party? </seg>
<seg id="1946"> I can imagine that the Social Democrats could have a better election result. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> But on the other hand, it corresponds to the condition in which the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS is now. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> It&apos;s a party that has its own internal problems, is ill, and people perceive that it is not all right. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> In the election that gave clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> What are the internal diseases of the CSSD? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The decline for some time, according to me, passes through the CDP and similar things are now unfortunately take place in social democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> This is so that the lobbyists, influential people, who previously had expected that their prebendy will find the ODS, moved to the people in the Social Democrats and have influence on them. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Then it&apos;s related to the fact that the offices of the city of Ostrava is the police and collects computer. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It shows that the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS is not composed only from people who would like to the good of all the others, but many of them primarily on the good. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The CSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as seen in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> But that was a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> That&apos;s what happened before the election in Ostrava, was just a precursor of what is happening now in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Haskovo wing gradually stagings it casted&apos;s position, then this may lead to the situation after the elections, which will weaken the Sobotkovo wing. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> The man is in the policy in a situation where sometimes must Access the compromises. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> Everyone has an internal border, when those compromises do not, and this is my case. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Originally, I didn&apos;t want to run into the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, so I agreed with Luboš Zaorálkem, that I will try to get on the regional list for me as Mayor of Ostrava has just Sobotkovo the wing. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Haskovo wing but could stop. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Why you&apos;re standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and Michal Hasek? </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Marcia Sobotka is a man who always speaks mainly about the Social Democrats and to a certain extent and the visions for the party and for the country. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> I admit that from the other side, I haven&apos;t heard anything like that. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Michal Hašek just fights for power. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> I don&apos;t understand, how can the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the Executive Committee, to start just dismiss the Chairman of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> It is a struggle for power, regardless of everything, and the Statute of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> According to me, as now demonstrated in Prague, Michal Hašek, ended his political career. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> How do you perceive that you lead the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS on the list of Ostrava did not approve. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Political parties are based on the competition, who are both from the place of their members. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> The competition should be largely based on the programming and the ability of those people to fulfill the vision. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Of course, in this contest, even people who do not have much ability or vision, but a political party is for them a lift to the money, which should be elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The problem is when these people begin to receive to the forefront due to the fact that unscrupulous breaking the rules violate the statutes of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Its practices of the political parties of the mafia and so violate the laws of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> To draw attention to this issue is more important to me than that, to take into account whether it has some some political future Kajnar. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> It is important that the parties began to respect the statutes. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Therefore, you are handed a proposal even before the elections to the Court on the preliminary injunction against the form of the list of SOCIAL DEMOCRATS in the Moravian-Silesian region? </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The current District Executive Committee of SOCIAL DEMOCRATS in their power strengthens the fact that organizations that do not comply with him, he can cancel the assigned based new organization, gradually throwing inconvenient members of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> An example is the need and that it wanted to exclude Bednaříka from Club officials to Richard, but he filed suit against it and they then resolution about its exclusion rather than canceled. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It shows that compliance with the statutes of the party to pursue through the courts, although the last option, but at the moment those other ways and control bodies within the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS stopped working, it is the only option. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> In an effort to lead the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, led by new Knesset Adam Rykalou is the appeal from the position of the Mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> It is a public secret that this post has to take the Mayor Faces Lumír Palyza. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is so, Adam Ram and Lumír Palyza trying to do everything they could to get me off. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> They promise people the position, gaining votes and those votes then solidifies his power in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> When I go back into the past, so everything that happened to be around the football club Baník Ostrava Bazaly Stadium, and the purchase was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> It was artificially staged to mark me as a person who gives money to where it does not belong. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> While the city bought the property, which has strategically for him a great value. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> How do you keep your remaining in the function of the Mayor? </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The District Committee to me and yet more people on Monday urged us to consider your continuance in the CSSD. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> But I think that this is so, such as when the thief shouting: Stop thief! </seg>
<seg id="1992"> When we look at the results of my work for the past eleven years, so I don&apos;t see anyone in the Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and pushed through, sometimes even against members of the party, the emergence of so many things, such as the development of industrial zones and the extension of the science and technology park. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Yet all become uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> I don&apos;t read it differently than the way others piled on the points, after which he desires. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> You against these efforts, yet somehow fight? </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Because if this Republic work well, so must work well, as well as political parties. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the State, if he can&apos;t even drive itself. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Therefore, the possibility that I&apos;m now retired from the Social Democrats, because I think that the one who causes cancer of this party, not me, but these people who are trying to drive me. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> We want to show that he can still win, Pilsen promises Rajtoral </seg>

<seg id="2007"> The team is on a difficult match with the Severočechy, who play aggressive soccer, carefully prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> Everything is going to match with Jablonec, coach us well prepared, as always, we draw a lot from the videorozboru games opponents. </seg>

<seg id="2017"> Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zemana and ODS. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> I have in recent months repeatedly called for open letters to students, educators, and the leadership of middle and high schools in several regions to defend academic freedom before the electoral campaign, which was conducted by the school President Milos Zeman. </seg>

<seg id="2023"> The newly elected Deputy for the CIVIC DEMOCRATIC PARTY, the Dean of the Faculty of electrical engineering and Informatics, University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to withdraw from their academic functions, and Moreover, it seems normal. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Sir, it is not really the same thing as if you stayed, for example, in the function of the Mayor of a small town. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> Do you want to include the regional Presidents of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, who are working at the same time the function of Deputy Governor, and just as they degrade both professions? </seg>
<seg id="2026"> The people say that can handle both of these challenging features of left back. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> I know, we have here an example Michal Hasek, who manages to even tens of functions at once. </seg>

<seg id="2029"> We find the opposite, and a positive example. Štěpánky Fraňkové, who prefer to leave the seat post to fully attend to the leadership of the city of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main reason of my recommendation to leave the function of Dean, however, is that an accumulation of functions you break apolitičnost academic soil, University of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Management of ODS sees your current action on both positions as an advantage for the University. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;His&quot; school, however, you will be able to help you without the Dean. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> I think that a similar opinion as am I and Rector of Miroslav Ludwig will have your students. </seg>

<seg id="2052"> Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case, which was one of the employees of the YMCA Association charged with offences relating to child pornography, and on the other, when p.e. teacher in Caringbah YMCA associations in 1991, was convicted of molesting children in their care. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Mr Hare said Gaili Furnessové, Counselor of the Commission that the first he knew about the case, but not on the second. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> He admitted that the introductory statement of the Association YMCA was also inaccurate, stated that the organization is to carry out the external audits of the YMCA, which awarded this Organization as the leading proponent of the rights of children. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> The evidence submitted by the Commission talks about that the YMCA was reminded that, in the audit of the Ministry of education and the company from August this year received the second lowest of four possible ratings. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Mr. Hare, which began with the Association of YMCA work, when he was 21, he confessed that the leadership from him alone down failed, when Mr. Lord has adopted, without evident whether it is staff aware of the obligation to report violations of the rules of safety for children. </seg>

<seg id="2059"> Mr. Hare but rejected claims that the Association of the YMCA had a cultural problem, which the report said staff security breaches children Mr. Lord. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Staff members have submitted evidence that witnessed such infringement, including that the Lord was with children alone, privately, he is standing up for myself on his lap, he used to say that he likes, and he is playing with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Danielle Ockwellová, who was Lordovou the child and asked for training, safety of children, she worried because of his behavior, she testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of services for children in the YMCA Association in New Zealand, who was a Lordovým parent, was &quot;very intimidating, and often it was difficult to talk with him about something&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> The Director-General said that he does not accept the evidence of staff that they felt uneasy if they had contact with his superiors and the acts of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Instead, he said, that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment and, therefore, did not report the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Mr Hare said that the Council of the Association of the YMCA in New South Wales said its view that the lesson of &quot;the case of Jonathan Lord&quot; for organization lies in the fact that the staff &quot;did not file any message&quot;, and the Council agreed with him in it. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Mr Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations emerged, made General Manager for service children in the YMCA organization Liam Whitleym. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> He said that the aim was to avoid a distortion of the evidence, but was &quot;overly zealous&quot; and poorly made. </seg>

<seg id="2077"> FAA: Airline Passengers can now use in aircraft technology gains (but not to call from their mobile phones) </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices &quot;from the gate to the gate&quot; – in addition to the call from their mobile phones--reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated the new rules, which on Thursday released a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). </seg>
<seg id="2079"> The passengers but they do not expect that the changes occur immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> How quickly will be introduced will change according to the individual airlines vary, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The airline will have to manage the FAA demonstrate the extent to which their aircraft correspond to the new rules and that the updated training manual for cabin crew and the directive for the storage of equipment in order to comply with the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The FAA said it has already received from certain airlines plans to extend the use of portable electronic devices in the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> At present, passengers should be required to turn off its smart phones, tablets and other devices, as soon as they close the door of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Cannot turn on, until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issued the permit. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> From the passengers, it is expected that their device will be switched off again when the plane landed, drops and is not turned on, as long as the aircraft is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Under the new rules, airlines whose planes are properly protected against electronic jamming, allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> Since most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that has been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at a higher altitude, it is expected that this meets the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Laura Gladingová, President of the Professional Association of cabin attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> &quot;As soon as the new rules will be introduced safely – and we do it with transport companies we work closely--it will be a success,&quot; she said in a statement Gladingová. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We frankly tired of that look like &quot;watchmen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2093"> However, surfing the Internet, sending emails and sms or downloading data will continue to be under 3 km altitude is prohibited, said the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Passengers will be notified that their smart phones, tablets and other devices switched to the air mode. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> So still no Words with friends, online scrabble type game, played by actor Alec Baldwin on your Smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from aircraft, American Airlines, because he refused to turn off your device when the aircraft was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> And heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of the fear that someone could get hurt if they were flying over the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Calls from mobile phones will be on board, continue to be banned. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify the FAA, but the u.s. Federal Committee for telecommunications. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The FAA can for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing to repeal the ban. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Committee for traffic safety, an expert on national security in the transport sector at CBS News, said that mobile phones will continue to be considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> &quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because it can potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but also of the FCC, we know that in the air can cause interference to radio towers,&quot; Rosenker said. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Business Advisory Committee created by the administration of the FAA, therefore, to examine this issue, last month suggested that the Government allow the wider use of electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The FAA has been pressured in recent years to mitigate the restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskillová, a Democrat from Missouri, contends that there is no legitimate safety reason for this prohibition. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> Restrictions are also more difficult to enforce, since the use of such devices is ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Some studies suggest that up to a third of the passengers oblivious to the obligation to turn off your device, or it ignores. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> The FAA began restricting the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference with the navigation and communications equipment, when the passengers began to carry FM radio technical výdobytek at that time. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> The new airline is much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA, that was resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The airline already has for several years offered to passengers using Wi-Fi in the elevations. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The vast majority of airline companies would under the new rules should adapt to greater use of electronic equipment, said Huertová. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Current electronic devices generally emit far less intensive radio broadcast, than it was for previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> For example, an electronic reader when turning pages only the minimum broadcast. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> But the broadcast is stronger when the device to download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Among those who are pushing for it to release restrictions for the use of these devices by passengers, is Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> In 2011, the representatives of this company&apos;s airliner loaded with its Kindle electronic readers and made a test flight, but no problem. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> Members of the Advisory Committee, the FAA expressed mixed feelings regarding whether these devices pose any risks. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of passengers of airlines said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> Other members of the Committee stated that there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aircraft systems, and most of these messages is very old. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> However, the Committee recommended that the FAA require pilots to let passengers off equipment during instrument flying in low visibility. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> Group travel industry welcomed these changes and goes according to her about a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, that technology uses fully. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security,&quot; said Roger Dow, Chief Executive of the U.s. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="2130"> And the President is determined to try to explain it to people, and to clarify and now performs a thorough examination, that no one had the feeling that there was abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> I assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA seeks the good of the Organization and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> He added: &quot;we&apos;re dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2639"> The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, because they transform the cells of the liver at the factory for the production of antibodies. </seg>

<seg id="2644"> A desperate cry of the Obama voters </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Obama I voted twice, I shared the hope of possible change </seg>
<seg id="2646"> He says that Obama&apos;s sincere efforts to stymie the Republican party&apos;s obstruction </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of the Obama administration&apos;s health care Web sites or attacks of unmanned aircraft </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Memoirs of the Obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could happen </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Nathaniel p. Morris second year studying medicine at Harvard University. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> These days I&apos;m reading a very sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> About this book I thought that me during the grim days of my second year at the Medical Faculty encourage and restore a modicum of hope in me. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (Boldness to win) and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> When I finish the testimonials of patients and I go to bed, book me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people take you breath and speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> The election ended in overwhelming and television coverage made us to reflect the historical value of this moment. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> My classmates cried with joy and my parents hid&apos;s newspaper, which got hold of. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The White House headed for a young team of visionaries and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> During the inauguration in 2008, Obama had the support of 82 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> And here the book closing. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> Go to the present is a harsh awakening, as talk of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> It&apos;s hard to remember those optimistic days – seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> In the years after I dropped my first ballot, actually changes. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> It was certainly nothing from what I had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> I recognize that Obama has reached a series of large and diverse achievements--from the law on the care available through the evacuation of troops from Iraq and end the policy of &quot;nothing to ask, not to say anything&quot; after the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> In addition, I believe that the partisan obstruction reversed so much efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the ability of the public to choose the health care and the closure of the base in Guantánámu. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> But after many situations when I&apos;m in front of colleagues and friends defended the Obama administration, I as regards the explanation, which can provide, come to the absolute limit. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> I found myself in the place of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain the consent to the interception of foreign leaders nor with the drones, airstrikes that kill innocent children overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> You cannot explain to them that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, even those who are chasing the wrong cabinet meeting reveals. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakího, an American citizen, without a proper court or for the reduction of public expenditure and contributions during the presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> Cannot be justified by the findings of the report, which says that the White House&apos;s efforts to muzzle the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... Since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2671"> And, most recently, cannot excuse the failure to create more than 3 years after the signing of the Act of the available care simple Web pages. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> I do not know whether something like that could be expected. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Whether I&apos;ve had in 18 years, suggested that the Government may be too much at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Obviously does not have a predictable function of the chosen course and our public dialogues will form an opposition political party and incidents such as the massacre in Newton. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> But all of the examples that I have stated above, is to a large extent seem to be the result of his own decision of the administration. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> And it bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Mitt Romney was zmatečnou and nevybroušenou as an alternative, and it seemed that he could not consolidate its policy or position. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> I had a feeling that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, which we once heard. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Yet it is a return to 2008 – how to support Obama this week dropped below 45% – through this book becomes increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It makes me remember the series of promises that faded. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama in primaries in Pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> For additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they must get back into the pace and remain faithful to its mission. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> &quot;I want to get back our charm,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2729"> This project is a key element of energy security of the entire European continent. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> South Stream pipeline would add diversity to the Russian export routes across Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2736"> Early puberty: Advanced previously </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Research showed that African-American women and Hispánky reach puberty earlier than their white contour lines. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Physical changes do not imply that approaching puberty </seg>
<seg id="2739"> It is not proved that the hormones or other chemical substances </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Experts say that one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The Trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children&apos;s health and family problems. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Zděsit should be a mother when her daughter begin to grow breasts and pubic hair in 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2744"> At the annual Conference of the American Academy of children&apos;s doctors this week in Orlando, Fla., explained the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> &quot;I spent a lot of time by parents said that it is usually not a sign of rapid development toward full adolescence,&quot; said Kaplowitz </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Visible signs of development, as is the growth of breasts, pubic hair and underarm and body odor, for girls there earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> For the past forty years, however, was only a small shift in the age when the first menstruation occurs. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> In the United States is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years of age in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> &quot;When they start to develop breasts, expire at least two to three years before the first menstruation,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book &quot;Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem&quot; (Early puberty in girls: the Essential Guide for mastering this frequent problem) </seg>
<seg id="2750"> The most reliable test of how puberty continue, it is time. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Discussion about what triggers the actual beginning of puberty, but if growth is accompanied by the growth of the breast spurtem before 8. a year of age, the girl is considered to be &quot;prematurely mature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> In most cases, the process slows down or stops--can doctors closely monitor child. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Faster growth can be a reason for it to an endocrinologist he in order to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> There are medical procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging bones, which may eventually lead to the cessation of growth and dwarfism in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Recommendations for medications and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, development speed, the speed of growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Psychosociologické are also important aspects. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> As regards the deployment of drugs, is cautious, but Kaplowitz acknowledges that &quot;the Suppression of puberty can alleviate problems with the behaviour of girls and its feelings that differ from their peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Understand is the next big problem: Parents simply don&apos;t want their very young daughter should menstruation. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> &quot;Do you fear that you may become pregnant, or how it will deal with sanitation,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, whose daughter started having menstrual periods in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Although there were indications of menstruation and we talked, not ready emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> She came home from school scared and upset, that is from their girlfriends first. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> There are many well known theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> However, there is still a coherent set of evidence that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Boys like girls – reaching puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most important reason is the obesity epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> In 2001, he helped with the implementation of a study on girls aged from 6 to 9 years, that connects the body fat with the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> African-American women have in this country, and Hispánky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Explanations are various. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> From a global perspective, it seems that the patterns of early puberty are affected by everything from the economic conditions through the climate to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Another puzzle: although for boys at a young age is already emerging pubic hair in her face and hair, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> Other doctors participating in a Conference of the American Association of physicians (AAP) have added further complexity to this topic. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> &quot;We have to be careful when it comes to how we identify the real onset of puberty,&quot; said Lawrence Silverman, paediatric endocrinologist from the Goryebské children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Parents shouldn&apos;t hesitate to get from your child&apos;s doctor&apos;s instructions on how to talk with your child. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> &quot;It may mean the need to talk with a child sooner than you expected,&quot; Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> If you stay calm, your child probably will respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Girls who evolve sooner, they need assurance that even if this is done prematurely, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2850"> AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill construction material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Therefore, the dump, full of building materials, tires, cans and insulating foams in August found the environmentalists, which immediately reported. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> The Russian authorities are kály and landfill. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> But just for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> Last week, reporters at the sight on a landfill the size of three football pitches. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> Is not the only one in the area has several such places, described the British The Times. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> At the place of work of the Russian railways, the State monopoly, which is roughly the šedesátikilometrovou path between the airport in Sochi and sports resort. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> The firm, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, led one of the close associates of Vladimir Putin&apos;s Jakunin. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> In August, the railroad from the landfill started by someone from the subcontractors. </seg>
<seg id="2859"> Local residents are already but desperate. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> According to the inhabitants of the Achštyru around the village for three months day and night buses trucks full of waste material. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> According to the experts, that the waste contaminates the river Mzymtu, the other local streams, and finally the Black Sea. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> &quot;The water from the water sources on sočské contaminates the next ten to fifteen years,&quot; said Vladimir Kimajev of the worksheet to the British environmental non-profit organization EWNC. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Illegal landfills are not the only problem the Russian organizing Committee and the Government. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, one big tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> For comparison: the games in Sochi will cost 51 billion dollars, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 came to $ 43 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Last year&apos;s games in London were only 19 billion, and Vancouver mentioned nine billion. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> In addition to the corruption scandals, project delays and fears, if eventually there will be enough snow, there have been reports, too, that when you work at the exhibition venues and infrastructure to comply with human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Last month, one of the workers sewed her mouth to protest, they didn&apos;t get paid for two months. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Many are also worried about how the Russian organizers during the games, popasují with the new law, which bans the promotion of homosexuality. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Some visitors are going to Russian gays at the Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> The rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in Australia for the time being in force </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Australian airline passengers will have to remain off their tablets and smart phones during starting and landing as well, regardless of the changes in the u.s. for the purpose of easing regulations for these devices. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The u.s. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave American companies the space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read on their devices, e-books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight, if the device will remain in the &quot;air&quot; mode. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> Passengers no longer can do during most of the flight, but annoys many people that they cannot have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Australian carriers to examine this decision from the American carriers requires a large piece of work, in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they soon plan to change their practices. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The civil aviation safety authority (CASA) also said that this notification is explored, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia are still in force. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;CASA currently has no specific legislation regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> This issue is covered by provisions which require aircraft operators to ensure that at all times the safety will be maintained and that the passengers shall act in accordance with the safety instructions, which they acquire from the crew members. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> Virgin, which already with CASA talked about extending the use of the on-board entertainment system, wi-fi, was in favour of the change, but announced that it shall be subjected to the decision of the regulatory authority. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> &quot;We would appreciate if the Office carried out the analysis of the permission to use the CASA electronic devices, because you really think it would be now, when we have (wireless on-board entertainment), improved the customer experience,&quot; the spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Qantas has announced that they will hold the current rules for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention to change any time soon,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> FAA rules apply to u.s. airlines. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> But we are concerned about the constant developments in the regulatory field, which can be useful for our passengers, and be sure to thoroughly study the FAA&apos;s decision and the reasons for it are. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their air fleet. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference on mobile phones, and also revise the manuals, training materials, programmes for carry-on luggage and passenger information. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> &quot;As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance its fleet, passengers can afford to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smart phones, at any altitude,&quot; the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> In rare cases, low visibility, the crew ordered passengers to turn off the device during the landing. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The Group also recommended that the heavier the device during takeoff and descent safely stored under a seat or in an overhead storage space. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> Nonsense in the film Gravity, but it is a beautiful spectacle, say experts </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Fantastic film from space Gravity some time after the premiere of the remaindered in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> Saw him in October, according to the Union of film distributors nearly 150 thousand spectators and earned over 26 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> Most of the reviews evaluated positively the snapshot. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is, however, other irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from among astronomers and astrophysicists as they rather liked the film and noticed some nonsense, which appeared in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Jiří Dušek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium in Brno): I like science and fantastic movies, which I consider to be modern, dreamlike fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The Film including the Gravity, though disguised as &quot;physically real&quot; performance. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> It is not, but this does not mean, that would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> I enjoyed him very much. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Note You may need to Sandra Bullock hair that somehow floating in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Hubbův the space telescope and the international space station are significantly different current rail systems, and therefore cannot be seen in one shot. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Some viewers of the film blamed unrealistically applied effect, and all fire behavior in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The suits would also withstood that such wounds. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The heroes in the movie Gravity will often get into a collision with different subjects and suits without major problems, everything lasts. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> The criticism was not spared neither the empresses. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> So extensive a tragedy on the Earth orbit is by some chatters unrealistic. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> In addition, wonders why the doctor was sent into space to correct technique. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> People on the forums arguing about &quot;unreal&quot; behavior of the lan. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The said acts as if it were intended for bungee jumping. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium hl. m. Prahy): I&apos;ve seen him so far only on a broad canvas, but clearly I can say, I was enchanted. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I&apos;m glad it wasn&apos;t a film documentary, but science-fiction. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> And for such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) not to hold consistently reality. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> &quot;More than you mentioned irregularities it touched me, as is shown by three space station with degrading the level of techniques (the last time Chinese).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2914"> &quot;Indeed, China will be up to the end of the Decade and probably will look better than it is in the movie.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the CZECH REPUBLIC): the computer-generated scenes the authors very successfully to nuclear physics, and science-oriented Viewer will appreciate that different cosmic collisions and crashes quite rightly maintains momentum, speaking dictionary, physics, also look at the Earth from space is a very realistic including the thin skin of the atmosphere and surface of the Aurora on the polar regions. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> A more detailed examination of the irregularities I&apos;m sure they can find. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Additionally, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space junk in orbit in some scenes appears to be reversed, than this should in fact be (from West to East). </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences): some of the stuff makers adapt to meet your needs, but no major and blatant sin against the logic or the laws of nature, I have not seen in the movie and in comparison with other movies like the focus is to see that the creators have given depend on the credibility of displayed events. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> From moments that do not give a sense of worth to designate the fact that Hubblův space telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> The result is significantly different relative speed and the rescue operation would therefore in fact could not take place, as was shown in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> Then in the time Department Kowalského (Clooney), and stone&apos;s Office (Bullock) I noticed that the ISS was, therefore, not clear origin of the forces acting on the Kowalskiho, forcing both players to let go at a time when no longer move relative to each other. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Bombardier profit fell as a result of the decline in shipments and orders </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and trains reported on Thursday a 15-percent drop in net profit, which is caused by a smaller number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contracting problems in the train unit. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not disclose any data on air test for its new CSeries aircraft type, nor to offer current information, as regards whether this aircraft with an ambitious plan to start commercial operation by next September. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> After initiating a test flight about a month ago and a half plane flew only three times and raised the question of whether the test phase is progressing well. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> The results fell short of estimates, and the shares on the stock exchange in Toronto have fallen about 8 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at State-owned bank Thursday lowered the rating from &quot;higher productivity&quot; on &quot;the performance of the sector&quot; with the expectation that the stock market will be during the next quarter or two experiencing limited growth. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> &quot;While the smaller aircraft we mostly had expected the profit margin in the field of transport significantly disappointed us,&quot; said Doerksen, in a report to clients. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> With the way the trial program will continue, we believe that the Bombardier CSeries aircraft order gets new. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> However, if in the coming months will not be notified of any new orders, we assume that market skepticism will grow in relation to this programme. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> Bombardier hopes to finish in the CSeries aircraft the lower area of the market that is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> The first test aircraft was revealed in March and, after months of delay, the first flight took place in September. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> The number of binding orders, however, achieves modest CSeries aircraft, 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to be able to verify the claim of the company relating to the low consumption and savings on the cost of the transport aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Currently, a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin had expected that, when placing the first aircraft into commercial use reaches its goal, the company Bombardier 300 binding orders. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The executives also assured on Thursday, analysts and the media, that the program is progressing according to plan. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> &quot;The test aircraft was left on the ground longer than expected,&quot; he said in a conference call Beaudoin and noted that the examination on Earth and software updates have been scheduled during the downtime of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Each manufacturer is planned otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and we did. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> It will happen during the entire flight program. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> According to the company, Bombardier would be the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the other soon after. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> Analysts are still skeptical of this, that would be the first customer of the CSeries aircraft could begin 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Bombardier claims that evaluated his plan to put the aircraft into service and in the coming months will provide updated information. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> &quot;This slow pace of flight tests--even though it is in accordance with the internal plan of the company Bombardier — probably will strengthen our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of the year 2015,&quot; said Doerksen. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> From US $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. September net profit fell to Bombardier $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> Turnover dropped marginally from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> According to the Thomson Reuters IBES system analysts had expected yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, said that compared with 57 aircraft for a year before he added during the quarter just 45 aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Net orders fell from 83 aircraft on 26. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Unfulfilled orders in aviation Division consisted of 30. September 32.9 billion, which does not change even at 31. December. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> &quot;The results in aviation were in line with our views, but the low order intake and overall condition of the market failed us,&quot; said Beaudoin. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Revenue in the aerospace industry fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest manufacturer of trains, said that revenue in this Division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> Unfulfilled contracts in the transport sector accounted for 30. September 32.6 billion, compared to 31. December marginal growth. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> The profit margin in the traffic Division was affected by problems with the realisation of several large contracts. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> The executives said that in the fourth quarter will be provided new views. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of financial director Patrick Pichettea, Google fell during trading on Thursday afternoon, about 8.5 percent of the value of US $ 4.83. </seg>
