<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy in order to counter the reelection of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the latter keeps the Brennan Center for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these actions undermine the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to Canada, the US-states for the conduct of the elections in the individual states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced the new laws, the procedure for the registration or the election. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has after the elections of November 2010 in importance, in which 675 new Republican representative in 26 countries could be recorded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 legislation introduced in 2011 alone, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new electoral laws that require the electorate a photo ID and proof of the US-citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws also the time frames for the early vote shortened, the right invalid on election day, when registering voters and citizens the right to vote for a Gerichtsakte agreed. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no US-state of the electorate, a photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state, which has such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed, this practice to extend to other countries. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years, they fostered in 34 states of legislation, with whom the electorate a photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the US-citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal cards such as the health card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, have 11% of US-citizens, that is to say a vocal 21 million people from a government agency issued identification of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012, do not have such an identification card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary identification. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low income disproportionately affected. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of the afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, do not have the necessary identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, who are seen as voters that their voice more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed, their ID issued by their body. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or Jagdvereinen stronger for the Republican side choose cards issued by these clubs for elections to use. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In 2004, a federal state for the voting proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state that such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that the voters demand that they prove their US-citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly designed to limit the Hispanic votes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, the democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican legislators 2011 in eight states of laws, with which the registration of voters on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> You also have the right of individuals and groups, to provide support to those voters who would like to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns to reopen in the general election of 2004 contributed to about 10 million citizens to register. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at the period for the early vote. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the general election of 2008 were in Florida, 33% of the voters who elected in advance, afro-Americans, although they only 13% of the voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applies to the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In contrast, the white, 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several proposals have been through the vetoes of Democratic governors blocked. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They could limit the damage caused in part. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws that require the return of a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the newly introduced rules in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the crucial states for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College, which are necessary in order to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to with certainty to confirm that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system would have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these actions undermine the democratic system in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The test: Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> The PSA test-wise, in fact, sometimes incorrect results on, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to greater reluctance of the already undecided men for the implementation of screening. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should be made or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have the opinion of two medical specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in mortality in patients with and without detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that a follow-up after 12 years of the likelihood of the formation of metastases of 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was performed. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I would therefore advise the test from the age of 50 years and 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men, afro-American origin is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers, the aggressive and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient must be the magnitude of the risk of his cancer really made clear he demonstrated by the possible options for which there will remain untouched, if he can the quality of life in the long term, and you are not affected in these cases for an active surveillance of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, in which cancer has detected no treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to her life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in a progression of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> It certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore commend the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> However, the most important thing is to speak with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the International Society for Movember Urology has developed an instrument with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA-tests to assess. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only available in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: Http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / United-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Prevention of disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no panacea for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress made in the field of research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of contracting him. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if all eat well and would move. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no smokers, this value would be at least a 50% increase,&quot; said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain completely unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, in spite of the decline in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It harms the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers,&quot; regrets the speaker André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, Mastdarm-, for cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life protects against Grimmdarmkrebs,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organization also recommends eating red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In a lot of it increases the risk of contracting a Grimm- or cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Salami should also be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists the link between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But now their research is not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> After the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies on vitamin E contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer discovered, showed a different rather an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has also not yet. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is, with his doctor about its concerns and his family drawn to speak. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not reduce cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs-which analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer has a certain sensation, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is, in fact, that this which about nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Lastly, it is the last particle whose existence from the Standard Model - our best or &quot;least wrong&quot; statement of nature and the behaviour of matter - predicted, but has not been empirically observed. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicists, it is still not entirely sure that this really the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a genuine new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs-like which. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data in this week on a major physics-Congress were presented in Kyoto, but it still lacks data, in order to be completely safe. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we take a look at what we are talking about. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There are in this world a necessarily unmissable law that causes two objects in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to breach the - and try it not too strong, since you are hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law applies: The Pauli &apos;s Ausschlussprinzip which says that two particles are not the same room at the same time to fill in the same &quot;when they are&quot;, the &quot;condition&quot; broadly from some of its properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, the physicist share the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens who politely be described as Fermione and obey the Pauli-principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, at the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons are organized according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: They will handle the here we are not &quot;and the&quot; Kraftteilchen, through which the great forces of nature, with which the Higgs-related which would somehow. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be emphasised, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read this chronicle, it was only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The photon or the &quot;some&quot; that the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field precisely in this place, &quot;disrupted&quot; in about like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disorder&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons &quot;bearers of the force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same goes for the Higgs-which, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs-field, &quot;&quot; must be disturbed, so that this which shows. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field-much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogens must reach very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks Rocky. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why a giant particle accelerator, such as the CERN needed - of the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to achieve these energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy of the electromagnetic field is helpful to the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, are doing this, but others do not, for example, would never have a piece of paper from the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And not all particles interact with the Higgs-field: Those who do it, have a mass, while the other (as the photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For what all these research &quot;can now be good,&quot; Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists, all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM to investigate. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are also many physicists who truly hope that such deviations are found, since the slightest difference a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; open and some holes of the model could fill. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, as there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> However, the CERN such deviations until now not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> The effects of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser in the 1960s was invented in 1962, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - has already said that the laser at the beginning rather than a &quot;Laborspielerei was seen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> Applications can also result from all of the instruments, the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the optics a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor is today all digital cameras globally as &quot;eye&quot; in 2009 and has him the Nobel Prize in physics. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care, the best way to die | Le Devoir... </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;death with dignity&quot; Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of Lebensendes. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this important area still much to do. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Le Devoir has tried to look at it more closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, he aufzehrte, had a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me five years to live, I have seven years been achieved,&quot; he said, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois lying in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: A vast weakness prevents any alone on the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> On the table in front of a tasty lunch, he resigned, agrees with the help of a meal. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He even manages to bravely smiling and talking with the strangers who are busy around him, his medication, and a bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, as this is&quot; humiliating, he shares with. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;During our lifetime we learn that a man standing government,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur notching, Victor-Gadbois psychologist at the home. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In return for certain persons Kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person, a step backwards,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this setback. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients in the home for palliative care and Victor-Gadbois, are all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage they are from the doctors and nurses who look after them, no longer with so called &quot;healing&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fears realised by suffocation, &quot;and&quot; to die. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease, I met my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good kids,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no wishes more in life,&quot; she says, before it accepts that you set a mask, her in breathing helps. </seg>
<seg id="172"> They are expected in the next few days is still a last visit her son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the intake of food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care will be used when there are no other possibilities exist any more. </seg>
<seg id="175"> More pleasant for the deaths. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, popular residents on a bed for the palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little if you consider that one day we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> This is the life under the best possible conditions continue, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It grants the dying depending on a swiss with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics need to control their blood sugar level. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer is served, who died in the course of the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son, the beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We will help families and patients alike,&quot; said Nathalie Pflegedirektorin Savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The home Victor-Gadbois is different every day. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to an old man of 93, the last Familienzusammenkunft well in the courtyard and is backed by his pillow, while his honour of opening dies of 36 years ago, a young man by his parents, his wife and two young children, is tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years occupied,&quot; Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care that is to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stages of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this big shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors of the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and suicide assistiertem with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. United Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec, according to the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high quality palliative care before you have accepted on euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, have I seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was without measures taken to their relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that the patient only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions doggedly to the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as she has aborted an arduous chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist tumour that I will break the treatment, they replied that they regret that the fight will be pleasantly surprised, I told them. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, they told me that I was in the end! </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotente care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, to thank the nurses that this wish has not granted after their pain is relieved by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be made clear that the palliative care in the treatment is not chosen. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to prednisolone Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal talk about 8% of patients not on a pain relief. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the end of life, the doctors are often on the terminale sedation, which amounts to the patients either sporadically or permanently einzuschläfern up at the time of his death. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option to these terminale sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients, not alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily, &quot;I want you to put me&quot;, but &quot;I want my pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible because of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute. </seg>

<seg id="217"> The &quot;Duchesneau-report&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>

<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, especially from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third largest city, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of repeated in exchange for public contracts to have received backhanders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Specifically, engineers have been accused of Straßenbauamts of Montreal, and entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony and Lino Zambito Accurso. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has sensation by giving the Commission the functioning of the &quot;system&quot; for the preservation of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He has several years of 3% of the value of the Treaties in Montreal to a with the mafia in the mediator of the money paid to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 ’ s had his hand in the game, more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) at Provinzparteien, especially to the newfound Liberals then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also acknowledged an illegal fundraising for the former liberal of Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Kanalisationsverträge whose cost of him were artificially inflated </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this before the Commission: In 10 years, he received from contractors gifts, invitations to travel, golf-tournaments, restaurants and hockey-games, as well as in the amount of $736.000 bribes in exchange for Kanalisationsverträge whose cost it artificially. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they lubricate the bills, with false services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay that he deliberately overlooked over a shadow budget has filled its coffers with illicit funds. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, leading Montreal into a serious crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the municipality Rivière-of-Prairies, in the east of the island, from 2010, they are against the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks on that for 5 million and acquired for $1.6 million in property developer was sold in the booming property market. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of illicit funds in the election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation will be carried out, in the end, she says, that she &quot;on a thread, which allows the functioning of ants unterwanderten system, in order to understand the problem and stop to denounce the perpetrators.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> It says that the procedure &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are to cleanse the wound, however, would need a certain fraud investigation unit only for Montreal, and supervision, to a return of dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How to clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> For its part, Jacques Duchesneau realizes that &quot;officials stole several hundred million dollars,&quot; but, above all, concerned about the role of the &quot;officials about the tactic in the picture&quot; if they are not involved in the scam. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Based on a percentage of 70% in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec recorder, he said: &quot;I was told that this is only a weak simulacrum of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes that donations to parties at $100, according to restrict what he will do nothing to change the situation: &quot;As long as the spending limit would not be strictly limited black money in politics, will be in circulation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the funding of parties: &quot;We cannot fall deeper; by making things with courage on the bottom of the house, we can on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story the international reputation and that of Montreal, Quebec, calls for Mr Duchesneau those who laugh, a look in its own backyard to... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season with PSG you have taken on a new dimension. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can find it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have come. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I make progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff also has given me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These elements spurring me on a daily basis, to improve the quality of play. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game that is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football is all very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I must stop not in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You are thus the use of imported competition by Carlo Carlo... </seg>
<seg id="263"> The new additions this summer games are accustomed to a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that any training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player who, as I have to stand up to and his best wishes. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Carlo Carlo, gives me a lot in terms of my Spielposition. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is of Co-trainers such as Claude Makelele, of how I played on the same position. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Carlo is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Carlo instills all technicians respect. </seg>
<seg id="271"> In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a rich experience and has many titles with prestigious clubs won. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I have an encouraging talk with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At that time, I have just recovered from a Verletzungsserie. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust he has placed in me, is also a statement of my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the Company. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We have in this way to the last sixteen. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the aim of the association in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we will oppose very good European teams to have our say. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Firstly, we first of our group in Porto, so that we match the return leg of the event can unsubscribe. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has the budget for this... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club Paris title win, you have to make a name for themselves in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially the PSG funds so that this project concrete forms. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win this, as was the case last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it is really at the heart of this track suit. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, we were close to it. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have opened the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have completed with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally you should be master with 79 points... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But a different team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this year is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media too much from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We accept the perfect. </seg>
<seg id="306"> However, if we with a home match against Troyes 4-0 win, and you still have to find something that you can accuse us of, this is certainly a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never every weekend with 4-0 win. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to establish a concept. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds up over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League, we have strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, an association of the past two seasons, fails to qualify for the last sixteen, and which also made huge expenditure! </seg>
<seg id="314"> With regard to the invested sums believed you to break with 15 points. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, the last season, were not well were from this new PSG &quot;geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we in the month of May will be smiling winner and tell us that we, in spite of all the difficulties they have won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems entirely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better, that of a &quot;Zlatan-dependency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic and has many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a superstar. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respect for the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This inspires others to improve their quality. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, of one of the world ’ s best defender is also allows all others to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have the Euro 2012 experienced with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was anxious to participate in this EM. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented a little time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things there, from which I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I am, good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This was for my baptism with the &quot;Bleus&quot; my hope. </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the opening for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The tournament is strictly, is close to the players and to the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc was. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved his goal by us for the EM. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that the &quot;Bleus&quot; Didier Deschamps will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Is this on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Each has been used for all the other. </seg>
<seg id="348"> In this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin is possible without paying and sell Bank </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as so often in these technologies a political vision tangible: The belief that the current, from Bankmonopolen designed monetary system, to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented both a Bitcoin virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc) convertible and a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers on the network have already been some 200,000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand websites accepting Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of $30 (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to $2, before he now has recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly age compared to the world trade by real currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest for this. </seg>
<seg id="358"> She describes as &quot;the Bitcoin virtual currency with the greatest success&quot;, &quot;in competition with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that are used to make progress in a video game to win by games or buy (and sometimes British). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, the trade every time controlled from a central authority and processed. </seg>
<seg id="362"> At the same time, all the network nodes with Bitcoin are repositories of the Rechnungsbuchs, Controllers, money-issuers as well as buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Any transaction between two users place in reality between two E-Mail-addresses in the form of an E-Mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address what the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of the associated with this transaction data will be electronically signed by a double coding system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network, check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network in the widespread Rechnungsbuch of public accounts. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The crucial step is this new deal in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is done on a mathematical task on computers is launched, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary Zentralbankier has the privilege of this additional line to add. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a carving up the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> &quot;The computer&quot; take the new transaction and add a number, &quot;chopped&quot; before the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find the one figure, a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If a user to cheating twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for one of the two transactions would only be validated by the network and the other remains without a shortcut, because both have different fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer of the task, receives 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The circulating to 21 million Bitcoins are limited, but up to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain room for manoeuvre... </seg>
<seg id="380"> Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement of computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has already had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin-deposits stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used flaw is not the real protocol,&quot; Pierre Noizat Paymium has just introduced a company for payment with real money is and the network Bitcoin uses. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reports about the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However, cash also these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players like Wikipedia withhold donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> By others as the blog-platform WordPress, they are accepted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the World-Institute in Israel that Rechnungsbuch analysed and shown that almost 80% of Bitcoins not in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, a &quot;Mega-Schlussverkauf.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, which Bitcoins Coinabul into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency is, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a business transacting network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, the owner managed its identity and can thus remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can be easily implemented the traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They simply need to specify the address of a phone &quot;and can be detected,&quot; Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend, with the hierarchical systems for more horizontally oriented systems be reconsidered. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB sees in her report, moreover, the various, today as a highly reputable risks in the case of a success to revalue the currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We are deducted from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after that? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the US is likely to follow by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army is taking possession of their territory again, and that the Afghan people to decide their future, without all of us to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have, in particular, the Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and crippled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse to an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their old and archaic traditions, even if these jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have taken part. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents will no longer be there if the Western countries are more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab I from one with almond orchard hills have observed the use of French loans, properly funded. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The helicopters and tanks-exceptionally lorry convoys have Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014, there will be no air more of the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Since her irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the different insurgent groups from the war. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Its coup was at that time as a kind of liberation and return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have the price for the obscurantism of the organisation Al-Qaeda overthrew farmers paid, but their situation has not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire, the women in a position of inferiority. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The most important personalities of anti-Soviet war are once again came to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned themselves in traders, land seized by the government in order to have it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell, and thus benefit from the massive US subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have discredited, and most of them were not even in the fight. </seg>
<seg id="420"> As I have heard in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not from thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who are the American grants to capitalise on the flight of capital that is significant. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have their advantages. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> These young people who either the obscurantism of the former parties still want to return to the corruption of certain executives, it will provide jobs. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with his Turkish series, the modern world, is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> An army is now available. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Will the authorities, under whose authority they will be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight strive for the restoration of the militias in the province, which is the power of the central administration. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities would have a degree of decentralisation of the example of Western nations benefit, but by abolition of the office of the prime minister, which since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, his country since the 1950s and long before dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industries have not been rebuilt, functional out are not available and important irrigation systems were not fixed. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables are not produced. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The private initiative is the priority. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country that wrecked by 30 years of war, would be a state control of the infrastructure needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The rumour spread that Afghanistan was immense natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were on the ground in order to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to the iron and copper ore on the ground, or without any means of transport for the export of the mountains is not a mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have a copper mine of Mes Aynak already almost leave, leave the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site and their excavations remain the most important employer in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day, it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>

<seg id="446"> This work, for the numerous local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: Irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil and increasing the farmland. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What souvenir let after spending of two billion euros? </seg>

<seg id="455"> Just over a week the head of state this House had two additional months for the conclusion of his works. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Egypt is now for almost two years on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US, Fast-strike Wednesday and supermarket-workers </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four US-American teenagers sits behind the cashier at some point by Mc Donald &apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In the last few days it came across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants, popular Fast-Food-chains such as Mc Donald &apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos; s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Still, no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether they will be back soon. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests by unions and several leftist supports nonprofit organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest salaries of simple Walmart- and Fast-Food-workers, the organizers of the protests, which aim to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents in the year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, described as the Black Friday, which took place in the US sales, the millions of customers, which sometimes four Handgemengen. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart-staff, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, and his work together with unions and leftist activists branches of the chain, whose target low and middle income people. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting rifles and automotive batteries and vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The goods in the Walmart-branches is an average of between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many of the buy-only slightly paid Walmart employees at the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Critics say the goods can Walmart only so often sell as well, because the staff are poorly paid. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Participants in the protest on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanding wage increases, and they expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution of the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart employees, the 9.5-US-dollar the hour, could not afford this increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the average wage at 12 dollars, it increases the hour Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> These are about 1.1% more than they donate now for pay. </seg>
<seg id="742"> The wage increases would Walmart to fully to the customers in the future, each purchase only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Every year, for they were compared to today by only spending 12,39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Proponents of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and any losses to the company. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday in his shop lasted from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and during this period Walmart sold approximately 5000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> As a whole, the Walmart-coffers on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the leftist Huffington Post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart-employees work and the protest niederlegten just &quot;another PR-trick&quot; of the trade unions, which organized the protest. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free checkout!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests were this week in New York, where her goal but not Walmart-branches (which in this advanced city undesirable and that is why there are so far), but McDonald &apos;s and other affordable restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald &apos;s says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet no sick days we granted unto you, and ye shall not pay for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation $7.25 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In Fast-Food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8.90 US-dollar the hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How it is possible in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once upon a time, nearly a quarter of all US-American young people after the school in McDonald &apos;s behind the counter, but the young people still living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hardly anybody was seen as the main source of income or planned to continue to remain there. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I encounter in interviews with staff of McDonald &apos;s constantly people who complain that they manage this reward and sometimes even their children to feed. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper comment, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if it did not know how to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protest, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald &apos;s in the hotel Street and Madison Avenue began demanding that the cashier and chefs of Fast-Food-restaurants a minimum wage of 15 US-Dollar per hour, which received more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also called for the creation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The US-American law prevents the management, to stand in the way of this objective and trade unionists in danger or dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, it makes the management is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The creation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-industry is also difficult for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Discontented </seg>
<seg id="767"> Thunderous protests on this day, there were also many other Fast-Food-restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald &apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos; s says it sell billion portions, and yet no sick days we granted unto you, and ye shall not pay for your honest work!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we should share the Fast-Food-staff, so that they get a fair wage and economic prosperity can achieve the every New Yorker deserves!&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of US-American Fast-Food-industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from everyone in the Fast-Food-industry are employed in the tens of thousands in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise all masses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far only moderately outsmart&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The supporters of modern technology popular subject of the enlarged reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer a working model, in November was then known, that Microsoft had a proper patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft-laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only an almost. </seg>
<seg id="777"> It excites the possibility, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - please describe in your group, which operates research. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far, the world largely stuck in the phase in which worked with pixels on flat screens will also be affected, sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and the radical changes foresee this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console-and-sensors: A step forward, and Xbox will no longer be sold without full glory here, since all for motion control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - While: The interaction on a physical level, is much more on the flat, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The entry of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has still not essential. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, are working on real 3D Darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We must make the computer world in our physical world they sacked and intelligible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> It is, however, important that not only the users, but also its surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> We could then the real world is a lot easier through virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And first and foremost we should these silly virtual-reality-helmets los! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about meeting? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but it will not be overrated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - You is certainly not the solution which can solve all the problems, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all paper information about his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any kind of interaction with computers, however, each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects on public squares on a project in which we with short, succinct, rather than with sweeping gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures, but not from the Objektkamera recorded by a bracelet that the movements of the bones and muscles registered. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still a relatively large, could in theory, however, reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But, all in all, however, is the future, for example, mixed Steuerungstypen gestures and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How it? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - We would like to ask you, for example, to these Sprudeldose? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it, and hints at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Normally I say it simply. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that would be very difficult to see. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - Heißt that you want the user to a machine that can provide at any given time and what not? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that we in the next time, especially in the development of new types of work must be that allow reactions from people in more detail. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The laser scanners, for instance, can be in depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - Which claims put on the basis of your work with the Xbox :-sensors on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of 3D detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It is not only the resolution along the X and the part, but also along the Z-axis are taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of frames per second is important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and to be honest, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with an adjustable Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> For my work I needed just a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - the number of cameras, should not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - is currently working with three: &quot;Camera&quot;, with one of them actually a and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or the problem would be necessary, as more calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> Beautiful would be: A flexible ,-similar system, in which we could play with different Kameraneigungen, to see how this in the 3D identifying a position helps. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - if I remember rightly, Google, Microsoft, in contrast to his glasses, not the public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course it is not pleasant, always a smartphone in the hand, but I think this: The neatest variant would be a &quot;changing&quot; enhanced reality, when we have a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone could switch </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal gadget and is its strength (private can only you can see), but also their weakness, for an enlarged reality through glasses that you may share with others to work in virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - positions us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but he is also available. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem on the critics often this idea: There are no tangible reaction. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all! </seg>
<seg id="834"> The responses to this objection to your group? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures I speak from the reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage. </seg>
<seg id="838"> She takes pressure is true! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually designed the &quot;images in the air&quot; to give something Handfestes, for example, the interference of some Ultraschallstrahlen directed at a certain point where the finger, a sense that at the moment is so weak, but as pustete someone over the knuckles. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings detect tissue injury in the fingers, this is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to outwit the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> We think that it can feel what it would feel if it is just a little? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, we have not yet tried it. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people who are physically in an enclosed space, to believe that he is instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gym), movable platforms and large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far it is only moderately outwit the brain and we still have many busy years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: On many issues, we are only at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> My own taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> The project &quot;Rosbalt Petersburg vanguard&quot;, the urban residents, which is dedicated to the vanguard of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the exquisite list landed already senior representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success beyond the boundaries of the city, and the often recognition in Europe, with no known in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The entire city is familiar with Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, you ’ re at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, with scene-meetings or at openings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they also attract large crowds. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially-philosophical artists who create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is also a man of the city and conjures his presence on the street by its citizens a smile to the face and keeps them for good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as he is to this difficult role in relation to his Künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image was finally ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why you are always in red and not for example in yellow and turquoise in the city? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is red, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the company calls on anything that deviates from some of the Graunorm, aggression and bad behavior. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But let me through my provocation with the people. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When did you know that you will have to painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture, the main city in my work were issued. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I must go this way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the time of the old free, but not officially recognized the painter at the time, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I befriended me with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; from &quot;Pushkinskaya 10&quot;, and then it was only once. </seg>
<seg id="868"> It takes me to the theatre, fashion, music actually to all except the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all the united in your kind-clinic... - It was important for me, in the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather themselves together. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I held a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation work a musically-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: NAME., Tequilajazzz, and, I also remember string with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; there. </seg>
<seg id="872"> String and his friends sang simple songs for the Play-back, wearing tight shirts and one of them was the trendy composer Igor Wdowin today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> As the group started to play live, was &quot;Leningrad from it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of &quot;Halli Galli-.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Even the gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the club &quot;Griboedov&quot; have their origin in the Art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There, our staff and guests. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture or something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000 there was a poll in the press, the award &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category &quot;artist of the year&quot; and that I was at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy in new times after old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> At the present time it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous, without a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - your works have an unmistakable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring the timeliness and sharpness of thought. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will be an exhibition on the theme of &quot;The Russian Museum as clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier, I was socially, but now it pains and fear, however. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In a clown blurs all this and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have preposterous ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> We save the world, for example, by making that everyone has to fully disguise. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now everyone on the clothes and is modelled on the exterior and the interior of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not give a person, but should spit him in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception is disappearing through their &quot;dressing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Before recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A cultural city should have a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if not I? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Can also commercial art be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - It has to commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the collapse of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> The people in large groups: The bohemians loved the One and the ordinary people of the other. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not &quot;one-dollar-note that everyone likes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you have to consider, if you like. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now, each Kultstar about 100 supporters. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - On the appearances of stas Michailow but several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - The abandoned him are women, the sexually-social sphere plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="906"> 300 people come for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, therefore, there is less Management, money, and anything goes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth, I painted such images in a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It means: Intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and who died in poverty and money in order to be able to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> That is the culture, which I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Petersburg - Kirill, what is missing? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good be cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> They say: Servant of the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The real Czar, it was different, because the Tsar might not seen much of culture, but it is understood that right experts are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good consultant. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have what might be, the experts, but they will be barred, because it requires hochrangigerer experts, the former and properly assess the way. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now, only the own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they will not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore seek other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is for you Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones can be difficult to grow up art. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers as a reader, and that is not true. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many people who are curious, exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> For us, these are much less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is the city of Saint Petersburg from grants funded </seg>
<seg id="932"> Birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Planet in peril. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of spaceships with Erdbewohnern on board are on the search for a Ersatzplaneten. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save humanity in the future, the important question of how we in the weightlessness or on the Ersatzplaneten breed? </seg>
<seg id="937"> Many choices, there is, in my opinion, not. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two genuine planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Even Mars and Venus&quot;, says the scientific staff at the Astronomical Institute include-Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> However, while the conditions on Mars, is comparatively build enjoyable on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The question of reproduction in space, the researchers first treated with regard to the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Already, half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of the Orbit planted peas differed not at all of the terrestrial species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It promotes a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicks have to find; it must stop on his legs and can start to move&quot;, explains the laboratory officials of the Institute for medically-biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without solid ground, the chicks wild. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later the instincts of a newborn stumpften completely. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> They then died four days later. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;We chicks hatch twice and the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew for failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last Brutkäfig flew with animals 16 years in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013, the experiments continued. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, on the Biosatelliten Bion &quot;only&quot; homosexual species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats, which already fertilized were sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;That was just with the Biosatelliten again, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing the Weltraumratten children. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction directly in space so you could not solve. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals in their natural habitat, can easily be taken out their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow. </seg>
<seg id="965"> In contrast to animals could be the man that in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Yet women fly into space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk, there was at Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The most precious that humanity has, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flew, and no one on the planet can answer the following question: Would have survived the most? </seg>
<seg id="972"> After the flight, they bring a child into the world. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Finally, no one answered that question,&quot; says Raumfahrtveteran&apos;s Watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after their most intimate, gave birth to the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, was also concerning Andrijan militiamen. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman gave birth in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice in orbit was disinfected and even work outside of one, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, there is a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have very few Cosmonaut, in which, after long flights all went well and they were healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even flights into orbit,&quot; concludes cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, the human race for new paths in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The Hydrolabor in Vorbereitungszentrum the Cosmonaut is a compulsory Station during the flight preparation. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in a state of flux win the Cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small Ichtyander having life on the country rose from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it will be easier for water to get used to. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget,&quot; says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While for a newborn child, so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the state of weightlessness makes the stomach and extremely fast Beckenmuskulatur back and, therefore, the ability to meet the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool. </seg>
<seg id="992"> For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer to the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot;, is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand the child also artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without the gravitational to feel the organism is the skeleton and the muscles do not. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child is not as an adult in orbit for training in a Belastungsanzug. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He is simply the missing in his life, which is of fundamental importance. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment, which we have in common, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have a disabled, a completely non-conformist will bring people to the world,&quot; says the head of the Bioethikkommission of the Institute for medically-biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space mere theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point, but reality, if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> NKÚ-boss: Control of the black-system failed by politics </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good monitoring bodies and adequate laws, falls in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says this is the vice president of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never completely, but it must be applied properly - and I think this is not the case with us&quot;, says Kala the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> At a similar conclusion also seems to be a common control by Czech and German auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As a negative psychology, he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so called &quot;black-system&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs do not bother with controls - the system is now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have its validity, and if something is illegal, but not just the Regierungsvorsitzende come, and the surveillance office, whose duty is monitoring the application of the law is, in its work, is hindering&quot; Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Temporary Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common Czech-German project, in which the legislation on public contracts of both countries have been compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What did it mean in concrete terms? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel test with which we have begun two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is that the European legislature, such as public contracts to handle are build on the national legislation, and finally, there is the real practical application. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the examination has not yet been completed, we were extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, are the laws we perhaps even more rigorous and &quot;perfect&quot;, the actual use, however, is in Germany in some parameters better. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not enough to new and more precise rules. It is also with the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project? What is for you for this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Just such a common control could help us constantly that we cease to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if it is apparently not particularly positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the reduction of threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that we, the system in this way only with excessive &quot;paperwork burden&quot;, and those who are looking for loopholes in the system have it much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds higher remained. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> What the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of NKÚ similar to the General Accounting Office, which is like us and also about a college, the only slightly different. In principle, however, both authorities are similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, is a state that these courts of auditors in the individual federal states - this is the German system of our. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control what our federal government funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public resources, which we of the districts and municipalities are managed under the control of Landesrechnungshöfe there. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> What the German legislation, which is easier than our? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I would hate to this without specifics. Nevertheless, Germany, in some respects, is often described as a role model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> Might it have to do with the fact that the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> This certainly not, but as I have said, I do not like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is worth mentioning that, those countries which, for us, a model are also struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing of a collaboration with our authority, is it not? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> What the Czech law, what was your authority for the revision of the Vergabegesetzes, you have any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that this amendment is only a short time in power, it has not yet in our tests. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As our controls later, we must take place here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Impact we feel so far in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have the new instrument &quot;identify risks of inefficiency and&quot; with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here are examined and analysed the impact of changes, of course, as the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system with further bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It may be, however, the problem is that the rules are strict &quot;and&quot; cannot be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are the review unterzogenen people against the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational program of regional policy, accountable to the regional council) that any failure to comply with the Vergabegesetzes a breach of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> But then, it is useful to make the law even stricter? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack and abusing the system, and not penalise those who have committed a formal errors on the actual decision making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the way out? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say first of all that is not successful. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls of the so called &quot;black-system&quot; would bother - what does this mean exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The black-system is now banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law must have its validity, and if something is illegal, but not just the Regierungsvorsitzende come, and the surveillance office, whose duty is monitoring the application of the law is, in its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;We change the law and allow the thing&quot;, but he can not say that we act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law which owes much contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition also correct. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also a tragedy if the bidder with the best offer only due to procedural irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is what I believe in us. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets, sometimes Eisglätte, mostly, however, they are dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic is partly snow and Eisglätte. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Mostly, however, the roads are good passable, sometimes is increased caution. </seg>

<seg id="1062"> According to the Bezirksstraßenwacht was limited visibility because of fog. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The highway R6 and the routes of the first Straßenklasse in the region are currently fully. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Attention is on bridges, for example, on which the lanes are sometimes frosts and smooth. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Passable roads are also all of the second and third Straßenklasse, including the mountain roads. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> On these roads, however, remain frozen ice or ausgefahrene section by section. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Especially in the higher areas be. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové </seg>
<seg id="1069"> On some roads there is danger because Eisglätte, both in higher elevations and in the mountains is situated on the streets, sometimes even a ausgefahrene spreads the road and Autobahndirektion shares on their websites. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The Straßenmeistereien before Eisglätte warn drivers, especially in higher elevations in the district of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> It is in particular to Eisglätte routes of the second and third Straßenklasse and in the circles, Ústí nad Orlicí, turning, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto. </seg>

<seg id="1077"> District of Pilsen </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The streets in the district of Pilsen today are easily passable, locally is, however, increased attention, and the driving is the weather. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> This is the morning frosty, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> Because it has snowed and temperatures fell, then it may come to Eisglätte on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Locally, with fog, with the point of view, however, during the day. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> These are data from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The D5 motorway is virtually fully passable, increased attention recommend the Straßenmeistereien, however, between the 80th and the 131. Kilometres. </seg>

<seg id="1085"> In the south of the circles of Pilsen and when it can, however, to Eisglätte section by section. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The lanes of the second and third Straßenklasse are moist and therefore applies here too the suggestion of icy sections. </seg>

<seg id="1090"> After the use of Streufahrzeugen remains slush on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road in the direction of Videlský Kříž. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> So we are forced to use Straßenmeistereien, in the district of the town of Šumperk according to the Straßenverwaltung fell about 3 inches of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> In the other areas of the district is the most fully road. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> &quot;In the district of the town of Šumperk still remain at high altitudes. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to gain positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that in less than a month ago, to the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those technology-based jobs, on which we have people just like you. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band The Tap Tap let us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which collect enough positive energy in order to avoid stopping or the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In December, you also a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> For this purpose, we want the Marketingpotenzial of the Maya calendar, whose end-use for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m. is forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before that, on 20 December, from 21: 00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno, Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts in about at the time to be on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a timezone at 12 hours before us, the Maya-calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who is this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Originally from me, then we have the idea, together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In this connection, we would not only collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but we would also like to consider together with the public on the state of the world, we handed over to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> On the occasion of the end of the Maya-calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key rings on the end of the world, with their purchase over www.e-tap.cz also support the people. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers also the anthem about the end of the world, with the title &quot;doomsday&quot; comes from. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Even today, the hymn to YouTube very popular. It will also perform at the undoubtedly? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, in the end, provided that all is fine and the end of the world is not happening... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem is of all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, the anthems together in a Direktschaltung from the Czech television broadcast live. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also plays Xindl X sings with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you come to the cooperation with two? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene that is that we realize many fundraisers and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We endeavour to these people in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has been shown that most are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts on the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the accessible Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we have already six years with the association Tap in Jedlička-Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the Jedlička-Institute are regularly of editors, who will help them with different activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the pupils themselves do not have the wherewithal to the editors, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the completion of the Jedlička-Institute is a private building, in which we then with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> During each concert, several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> On what criteria do you have these selected? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted a program that all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, enter Chinaski, support Lesbiens Illustratosphere support, with Dan, The {T} {T}, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> &quot;Similar&quot; big events are also planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to next year in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we ever in the United States, it would also be happy to appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their Auslandspläne are not just small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage these travel logistically and organisationally? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it first seems. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. We must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer and other luggage...? </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it has been without problems, ČSA airlines and British Airways were always very well prepared to us that I am sometimes surprised have already. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> By foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks, as there is with disabled people, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> How have you seen these things so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia, witnessing the east is still in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> To Prague is absolutely not disabled Moscow, where it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is, of course, there is not even a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator usually half hourly. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are clubs, trying on the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what respect, we need to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are still many things, in which we are lagging behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> This is, however, to note that an improvement in the situation depends also always from the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usual that even people with severe disabilities independently in a public space, toilets can use etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not normal that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events, and we are with the band The Tap Tap the West a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers are being things really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are isolated incidents of particularly sister personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap is currently very popular. However, if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to found a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Then I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička-Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I, myself, am among musicians and Sax games, I have, along with a colleague, a music-AG was founded. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Oh, and by the time this is how our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, to say, somewhat out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band was known only in the last few years, or not? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with famous singers has helped; we also have also started to campaign actively for us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We are aware that if something is doing this to the outside world and not to see their own performance is, in a sense, does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the EU-funds can we also good editors, high quality equipment and etc. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It was your aim, it with The Tap Tap so far? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the outset, I sensed the potential that things are not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Often copied in show business today, one of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is on its way, logical, because everything is new with caution and will be accepted only after some time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that {T} {T} among them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression that usually has the audience is, of course, pity; this is only of course... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this pity is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not a lonely and abandoned, which we regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities something, not only for themselves is progress, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was for this success is also helpful that you are a strict boss, as we heard by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you would like to make a good, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain degree of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> This is, in my opinion, but absolutely normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some are coming to us with romantic notions, and when they discover that they have twice a week test phases must overcome and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many fast. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> So it works but everywhere, in every band, the serious work and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, The Tap Tap 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one: Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group. People come and go, which cannot be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Who has the will and the desire to join with us, is always welcome. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of that ROSKOSMOS s savage twentieth. Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, that on 12 November 2008 ESA member-). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years of several ESA-projects. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path of Poland in space, however, was much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, they are not always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I refer, for example, to the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work &quot;entrance to the Exploration&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (nee 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years of Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934 Šternfeld won for &quot;entrance to the Exploration&quot; by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch donated Prix rep-Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a key supporter of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of space, thereby acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland had built a railway-trolley for which a Raketenantrieb planned. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the proposal and the details of this project, remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or the brakes of the trolley should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information originates exclusively from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933, the Polish infantry with raketenbetriebenen floors. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the documents show that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> The research was then, however, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, some in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric Jagdrakete on, and in the following year, the work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza Leliwa-Krzywoblocky&quot; of the author. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all the projects for military use of missile technology from the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, his work, however, from the war ended. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Another article on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first is that society in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in the four large items of space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Already at its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA for accession to the 1951 formed International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA has been an active member of the autumn of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first PTA-chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> He had this position until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> In 1956, the PTA has participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959, and began in the Błędów-desert flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further development stage should already be capable of real scientific work to do - the rocket RM-34 with an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of Höhenwinden. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, he was the further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Successor to the first missiles of type RM, from 1962 to 1965 developed meteor-1-Rakete. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete their total length, 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> From the rocket, three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which manifested in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The meteor-1A-rocket had a transport with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor-1B on 0.34 liters and meteor-1c about 0.62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude, with all three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> From 1965 to 1968 was the meteor-Luftfahrtinstitut 2-Rakete develops, its first flight tests in October 1970 started. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor-2 had a weight of 380 kg and was able to a payload of 10 kg in a height of approximately 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Meteor-versions were then musing and meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later to the establishment of a national COSPAR-committee. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the context of the Interkosmos-program at the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second Interkosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court, the Law on voluntary work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision was in the public a lively discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is certainly interesting, the issue even from a wider perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) Preisspannungen. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this term to understand is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying, by importing cheaper goods in economic competition, &quot;&quot; undercut the competition, turning it into a larger share of the market and to usurp his win. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or cheap shopping, or their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Since the capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rising unemployment caused is necessarily the spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and thus the overall economic and social damage. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced, in competition with each other, the social standards to reduce its own population, thereby artificially into the country to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, the governments will deliver its own people, without regard to the social consequences of private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is especially in amendments of existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The objective of these measures is to force its own population, in particular the dictates of private capital in terms of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is achieved by economic coercion in long term unemployment, by restricting the rights of workers. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The results are growing poverty and increasing disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany there has for some years public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of those affected are already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy, cases in which workers paid such a low level that the state of their incomes increase until the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was also in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity of practically all EU-Southern states will no doubt in the same state, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society, and it is to be hoped that at some point private investment capital flowing into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Of course there is the question of where this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it from another EU country-, only the poverty from one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, as in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco and Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This concerns the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media say ad nauseam that the state does not with capital to its own economy is involved, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital blinkered insistence on his view that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> But then we have to ask whether the capital the policy and that the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> Proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and all the ubiquitous lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, legislation, in the virtually anything criminally, but nothing is a punishable offence. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that a lack of finances Staatsministerium private, closely with industry Rechtsunternehmen interdependent with the development of individual. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> This legislation is adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All violence will no longer, as the people of the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously that liberal democracies is currently in a situation which Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompey &apos;: &quot;The state has long been understood in decay, and the authorities have been occupied with violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribe through illegal fraudulent use of benefits or with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Corruption fascia incontinent, and the people went with already bought votes in the election &quot;...&quot; people with character applied not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul &quot;...&quot; Man began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship and that a strong man &quot;... Appian should be elected to this, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is based society today as in ancient times on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The private sector is, by its very nature, is not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society and to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least concern for deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> From the current state of view, the demise of the regime in favour of liberal democracies as some pause, during which the next round already. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Particularly disastrous is the fact that today ’ s elites in future the loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have already witnessed today, as well as the crimes against humanity, such as those from the older and contemporary history, in utter ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least no permanent. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of the social standards to push down the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is therefore systembedingt. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution are targeted political-social reforms, which is the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in favor of the state in the society. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;... that nothing from violence, or ever could emerge&quot; sings in the song that Sting, whose main verse in the chorus is: &quot;... so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons were no war, there would be no&quot;, says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of: Rothschild, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some are behind Israel and argue with its right of self ‑ defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I should like at this point not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty person and who victims is, ultimately, the current residents of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence themselves do not. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My concern is that readers look behind the scenes, the look, for whom the 95 years voltage (counting from the United States-declaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East, above all, to serve. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from, and go out from my own understanding of who or what group of people make the events of the modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Every time we can have a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is the question whether it really always these personalities, autonomously given its steps, or if someone behind their throne of their actions, to a vorbestimmtes goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world less concentrated in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the lifespan of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under these astronomical stings a rich families, which one might call as head of octopus (I do not know whether someone is still on them, I support this but not from) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Much will not written on them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first press agency (Reuters) was from the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, bought the combination of their name with hochkriminellen deeds, in whose background is the consolidation of their power, the proliferation of their assets or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are involved in the central banks lead wars or equip them to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries after the fall Ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia ’ s central bank, in the meantime, the Russian government has implied). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Whoever has tried to this family, had to pay with their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln declined, the status of the Central Bank, Bank of America to renew during the civil war, started their own (read: State) notes and was murdered in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.F. Kennedy began to publish their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the honourable Member Louis Mc Fadden in 1936, after he was poisoned the Fed for triggering the Great Depression wanted to sue. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global Machtgelüste led the Rothschilds in 1859 - 1871 to formulating a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, a Freemasons in the 33rd, and therefore the highest degree of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war to the great Monarchist Staatenwesen Europe, through the second war in Britain ’ s colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is the world ’ s population of about 0.5, 1 billion people (such a number would reduce their facilities and its luxury and would also not so many resources) to create a culture of ecumenism is nothing more than the apron) and, finally, to the acquisition of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top, is the launch of a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order from Chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed to prevent crises like the triggered not repeat in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (instead of the destruction of the war was no longer required), then, the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In the Second World War, easier to spark the bankers, the policy a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic Kriegsreparationen occupied; thus they created the condition of impoverished masses so that they only have the Germans off a sufficiently strong leader, of the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, the function of a fifth column should take, and also the Kriegsbrand. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the establishment of a state sought, as in the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The United States already mentioned-declaration created the prerequisites for the immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the resident Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks, there were on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler from the chain losriss in which it initially had kept the international bankers, or whether it all went according to plan, is hard to see, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948 and, as well as by the Kriegsreparationen against Germany in the ground for the Second World War was prepared, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people as in World War II to the victims in front of the stage, this time Kampflinie together with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how strongly people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the culprit and who the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where only erred in an endless cycle of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It takes between the people of Israel, and differentiate their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as we, the people, exclusively their own candidates to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal subordinate politician who is doing everything possible to ensure that a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly becoming a global conflict could extend, and where it because of the control of Iran on the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, about 20% of global oil supplies run, to a destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In which light as the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: &quot;The only thing we need is a all overarching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order, a world of men and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every babies at birth is a chip implanted this essence of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it is that the little ones and the Great, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants all give a Malzeichen in their right hand, or in their foreheads that no one can buy or sell it for stigmatic, which is the name of the animal, or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is wisdom, intellect, who consider the number of the animal. </seg>

<seg id="1348"> Combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The experts for &quot;Exfiltration&quot;, Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The disguise was credible, published articles in professional journals about this film, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, he is a more realistic and, at the same time, leading a so called &quot;Caper Movie&quot;, i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the film Ocean &apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This alternate in the movie the Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence are iconic contemporary photographs shown to be watched, and also in the same situations, there are no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and devising so easily. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there ’ s the-scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, on the Amtsfluren, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable reboot of his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a spokesmen ridiculed actor is a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the target ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No breeze (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first movie Afflecks, not in the local Boston of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the village belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada &quot;played.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the Eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, however, and conveys a sense of confusion and the unpredictability, that happens, if somewhere even the story. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictitious scenes (the wrong Filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with that, too, that the story is not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> He is working with the little but quite successful, although he sometimes nachhilft reality - something which would not always so elegantly acting (the scenes in which the looming crisis in the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America is avoided, or the chase on the runway, looked a bit contrived). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is his overly broad scattering, which is due to the need for too much in action in too many places to show. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood-staff is very charming, its characters but would have more space, and they are in the film is far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film loses traction by something. It is a movie you with some interest and the design and to a thriller from the 70th years can approve of its retro-style. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> However, he enthusiastically raises difficult. </seg>

<seg id="1390"> There are also curious incursions at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Relatively absurd is also a directive that European officials itself - everyone in the EU has an official function, because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece does not use the name Macedonia and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say. </seg>

<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or of the idea of funding for applications for grants. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are affected by that we have no sea. </seg>

<seg id="1401"> The European Commission has so far in the Czech Republic, finally, that they have a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries, which have no access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Grants for applications for funding offered the municipalities of the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-deu) should, in practical terms, this means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act in Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="1413"> I am not seeking to Senator or to be president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything in our country would work without problems, I would be nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer see the republic for 20 years, as thieves plundered roam free, while the people of the taxes and increasing the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions, politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> When I see something, but what I do not like it, then I try to propose a solution to change this. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And because I have more than 40 am, and independent and cultural heritage, and I have no other choice than to change things for senator or the president to stand. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have managed and then straight on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Return the back not your voters? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have said all the time that the battle for the castle to the outcome of the senatorial elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I have this clarified and I said that I was a candidate for the office of the president, if I am elected a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> But I was as much influence and a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but starting, which wants to make a difference. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The media, which want to steal the honour, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> About me was, for example, claimed that I would journalists bribe or that I consultant by Jiří Paroubek was. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We are talking about your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The fight for the castle, you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You have to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the quarrelsome policy - when someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal is rejected, it is deliberately, and that keeps the population only. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent Parteiloser I have a far greater potential, support for all the parties represented in the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I am without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen of each party and the, which is the best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Watch as a person in the policy more right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From Czech view seems to me that I am rather see the people on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this right-thinking-links but totally irrelevant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, important that we can make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right; I want the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Always, I support publicly any good approach, even if this from the sides or of the ODS, and equally I will turn against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It bothers you, if someone you as populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But this does not make you confirm what you have just said. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you are a business plan in a company, then you have also a Idealziel and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And this would you approach. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can not describe it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they were of important experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> Without support in Parliament, but you still have only keywords. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And this brings you in the long term in politics. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk to the people, for example, will manage the material and criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side to these targets. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, it would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties to live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to legislate. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the addressee may then have to say why they refuse. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, which points to grievances, can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take only once the direct election of the President, which is a credit to the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to allies for my views and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> With the policy, I have only just started, for my programme and the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess things themselves; and if it does not work, then I am in six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It sounds a little as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I alone, and that is why I have nothing do with several celebrities wondered whether they do not want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I have spoken with Radim Jančura, however, refused to work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in trade with light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I began my candidacy with the condition that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not more secure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of voters are left to the elections, and those who have gone to the elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are so that only two Independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen such a Senatszusammensetzung that changes will be very difficult to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about the creation of a separate party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not thought about it, because I have no time in the past to check each potential Parteimitglieds, and does not have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I still have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> They have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> My personal wealth I value to about 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I had a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a superb Škodu, about a million is worth. And then I have a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was a dream - James Bond has always liked me, as in the car he was driving was galant to women and, at the same time, against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> They drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not particularly convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Shall I make about debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign are, in fact, covered by my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the Senatorengehalt alone I could not live; so I could not, for example, my son, the English school finance the 30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will therefore continue to work as entrepreneurs to have your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you go back these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that does not depend on the amount of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have in my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Thus, for example, my deputy managing director of travel agencies in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People want to see me as a Samaritan, of the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I have to live but also of something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> To which you were accustomed to such as entrepreneurs? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Some 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still the case. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As President, I would, however, all my endeavors. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The complete conversation can be found in the period of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The MVRDV architects show that the real adventure not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again,&quot; said Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, IT-technician at a nearby corporate sector, says: &quot;But, well, it is already, the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> However, I wonder why we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and E-Books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is still voluntarily in one of these old-style-libraries, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt before the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The 80,000-inhabitants-community has the lowest education rates throughout the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and the seven fictitious bridges on the frontloading are portrayed as a pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the Marshall. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so, the dominant that there is only one way, the statistics: A library to that! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas from Rotterdam architects MVRDV, Master of the heroic Balkendiagramme and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the same composure and appeared on the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a big smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury is still looked perplexed and top with the armpits wincing, the cheeky Maas his exquisite souvenir of a pyramid and finished his actionist based speech with the words: &quot;Love municipality!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> This is it, then, my proposal for the Bücherberg from Spijkenisse, for the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the EUR 30 million built expensive mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> He is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to the underground car park, supermarkets, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> This is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte that to date no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly Town Hall, whose white facades behind a Molkereifabrik would be inclined to suspect, a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Above all, however, has now Spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift, in the middle of the mountain massif, but the real space and rage (Lesefreuden when climbing the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The completely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned Klinkerboden unequivocally and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> We are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And all books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, of the most uncomfortable and impersonal is&quot;, says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have the classic Raumkonfiguration upside down and the reading area from the inside to the outside this House. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the Bücherbergs is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, Internet-library, Schachclub, environment centre and Haustechnikzentrale. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A particular pleasure are the black bookshelves, the times wall panels, sometimes parapet, sometimes Stiegengeländer. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Look, feel and smell are strange. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even a architects and building engineers whether unknown Baustoffs shake of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycling-materials,&quot; said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we are in a friesländischen Agricola one day on a waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields as Wurzelunterlage millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin textile holds a, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bottels. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library was the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under Hitzeeinwirkung and pressure, the socalled Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that was a little after new cars and a little after tennis shoe. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 steps you are arrived at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 metres long wanderings in Literaturcafé will not only with a fantastic view over the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen rewarded. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in Literaturgebirge. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe but this House, in spite of the many glass is a flagship project in terms of the environment,&quot; says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days just inside. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The broad lumber to serve as shading glass facade, and a large proportion of sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest fully automated blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT-industry, already ventured into the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And also the TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde Boekenberg even Spijkenisses &quot;long overdue soul&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: The opening a few weeks ago, each residents invited to a book from his personal collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> That is for the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 piece - be filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled up obenhin. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty Library&quot;, says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think, thanks to our invitation has now all inhabitants of a certain kind of relationship with this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is only to grace. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> That is the pinnacle of the MVRDV those who, in the jargon identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Literary history Spijkenisse has written. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> So young and uneducated they may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> That is a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;German must play a greater role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin balanced on a narrow diplomatic degrees. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it against the request for an observer of the Palestinians at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But abstained from Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have done, not. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But, at the same time, I believe that it is not the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, without having to be too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a no fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was finally by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is hard, Germany in important international issues to adopt a clear position? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, so to speak, to a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans are so between the fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> One expects of them that they play a more independent role, because they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, such as France or the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to national interests and positions that are independent of the US or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> It should therefore be careful, the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not to offend the. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, the plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not want too much weight to, this is not a totally biased relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In any case, but it plays an important role in German considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has its relations with the United States, damaged by the important decisions, such as abstained in the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that, in Europe, and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the Libyan question. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany is so that even a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> But because it signalled that it be taken seriously as an international player and his interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, on the other hand, have been clear for a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences between the United States and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly probably pretty much sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But because of the political situation here, can the government publicly not, of course, this position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the actual differences are not so great as they always have. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so audience of Netanyahu ’ s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the United States on one, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I believe that that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> This would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they can not part of a wider line and must instead be things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> They just do this with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that in future, Germany, a leading role in Europe to a European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> That is, of course, not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive subject. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the German, it is clear that they have a more independent role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Faces Germany itself in the role as a major global player - wants Germany to take a leading role at all? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or is the lead Germany still difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not accustomed to the is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to land a major role to play. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time that Germany will be a greater role, various anti-German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This makes it the Germans not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is, in fact, the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this perspective, Germany in a far worse position than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> There must be susceptible to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU has filled the vacuum at the moment but not, who is otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans are simply need to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like them, it is unpleasant and they still have a lot of unpopular, c &apos;est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America, together with the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, US-foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Brand protection in China:&quot; If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Conceals a in China officially registered designation, which have nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Still, she enjoys protection so long as the actual namesake not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then is not clear whether they will get justice. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing on property right infringements in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Every week a new case ends up on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The other rich a few additional letters, so that they register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> It is from Gucci simply Lu-instead of Prada, Gucci, Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also in this way, legally copied some of the manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trade Mark Office in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company in the trademarks Zegna DF Puma, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That the Chinese world champion in copying and the injured intellectual property, is known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are multistory department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Pattlochs cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he goes against Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially, a name given the right to use the already elsewhere is protected. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call the &quot;bang&quot;, a Beifahrermarke Mingpai. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is modelled on &quot;Bang Dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> That women were being rich men fishing. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It will be bad for business, we must combat Pattloch, calls it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will be diluted, the uniqueness will disappear, the damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and litigation costs of the industries concerned are going in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But deletions of dubious entries in the registered are difficult to reach and go to the money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Up to nine years is the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch reporting of cases in which the court overruled claims, because after the long duration of the defective name had become the &quot;reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff had the misfortune to pay Plagiator even money because he violated its brand in China, says Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also affect graphical elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, the company that recently took over the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The Chinese must therefore still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes-star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo-buyer Geely took advantage of a blue-white logo, the BMW reminded; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The Modehersteller Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, which the famous crocodile look the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is that there is 2010 due to staffing and finishing of bottlenecks. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Last year, however, is one of the &quot;emergency&quot; in the workflow returned to normal. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> So is the stock appeals procedure usually at 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Almost 57,000 such cases we have completed 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Yet still waiting in the office 81.500 objections to fulfillment. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Address it costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million requests to brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is a record and means that China for the tenth consecutive year, the list of Neuanmeldungen all over the world, shares the authority with. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> This applies also to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> 2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees have been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> This means that any simplified registration on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Address it costs a lot more, as the case of the German company Freudenberg shows. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the Group is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans were able to ensure that its illegal production was mined imitation of German automotive industry. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But secured the counterfeiters to continue the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> We have failed in Germany, as the family could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> In the next two bodies Freudenberg got it right, but the fighting Prozessgegner still further. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> It must be extremely </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now, the matter before the Supreme Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident that the thing to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal costs were not quantify the Firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files need to review the evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, the other side, Freudenberg in vain &quot;with a&quot; high rates to resolve. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This shows how much this is worth,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> That is, if they secure imitators vulnerable brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So did a Chinese manufacturer in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> In this area, the company has long since abandoned, however, he could turn the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We have to be careful,&quot; says Wentzler on the other. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloch German companies to advise in dealings with China to be very careful. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to turn to international trademark rights to leave the foreigners should somehow &quot;everything that is worth protecting, even in China, as in&quot; Wentzler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, it will be much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas is, it should be the other side pay royalties for their own name, explains Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we will be squeezed out of the market segment in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> AIDS Day: Stamping, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir rehearsing in Heidelberg Imbongi - and in Swaziland rejoice Aidswaisen about it. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> The story of a connection, the far more than 8733 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First the stamping: The men, and Damenpumps Herrenslipper search on the parquet floor the beat, find him quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only then the voices of the singer slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano, harass and persecute, trick. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year anniversary conductor, it almost from its Stoffschuhen if it with his smooth wild gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg Imbongi the choir rehearsing a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> About fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin until Hausmann. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om &apos;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, every Chorstimme has a different text and those still in a very strange language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help themselves </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Worldwide there are approximately 34 million HIV-, the estimates for UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations to control of AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million people live in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland 245000 Aidswaisen live. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> In the village of 180 Aidswaisen Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa godfathers in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It guarantees the child fees, school uniforms and a hot meal every day in the Gogo-Center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means to Zulu storytellers or Lobpreiser. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The Bantu language fluently speak is no one in this space, but sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly a decade, the chorus songs in this strange soft language and brings them back to where they originally come from: In the south of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> As the crow flies from Heidelberg 8 733 kilometres away, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, that of the voting power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple less limestone and net a large proportion of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because these the HI-virus. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitjeni shows in miniature, which is quite Swaziland: Highest HIV-Infektionsrate lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Restrictions on the male foreskin that the risk of contagion is proven to reduce by half of the population, are not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland-bear the immunodeficiency virus in the middle, with thirty dying is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> In a joint Africa-trip in the spring of 2005 discovered the chorus the village, but especially saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which not only lack of parental care, but simply to everything: Food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without a school in a poor country is certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him a warm meal a day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later, the choir founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, the since-almost professional to the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts on sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STI are HIV, herpes, Humane Pappilomaviren both or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Crab and itch are among the parasite STI. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and Tripper, especially in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch-Institute-estimates that at least four of five all-in Germany reported syphilis cases through sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> With the heterosexual adults-Trichomonaden Chlamydia infections, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV is among heterosexual adults here - but comparatively low: About 20 percent of the HIV-new cases in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections are among the young-much more common than other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Here also come Humane Pappilomaviren among young people frequently. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How has the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The number of syphilis-infections, according to the Robert Koch-des-Institute of disorders in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than doubled. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new cases of HIV-goes back since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about a tenth of less than a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> If the symptoms are to go? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The infectious diseases can genital ulcers, complaints, the discharge, hypogastric pain as well as vesicles or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and are therefore go unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can we protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but not 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Because some of pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases, including through Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Experts recommend that in particular when processing frequently changing Sexpartnern regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Early diagnosed most STI can be cured and cosmetics. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the passion that the choir in Germany, some ersingt comes together. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;Overall, we have already around 200 000 euros after sent Esitjeni&quot;, says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, managed a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman, the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It is also important that the orphans well, in one of the grandmothers around. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Gogos how the old women in Zulu, are the linchpins of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans in, give them a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day to school on time. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Anyone who has not come to the ski protection to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; launched a Nähschule, two Hühnerhäuser built and, together with the American Health Organization PSI organized that many in the village have an HIV-test. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not a matter of course, so obviously the disease throughout the country is, says they are dead. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Really strange in a country in which the king officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch, King South Africa ’ s III, is known for its excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy instead of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is also due to the officially sanctioned form of life, the HI-virus in recent decades has spread so quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms if there were indeed on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, &quot;but the rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Culture is a different - flesh to flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote the cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi-choir every two or three years through the South Africa and sings songs full of wistfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black assertiveness that many on the southern tip of the black continent even in times of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of White, the songs in a black sing - so much recognition not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The journey will always after Esitjeni, where the singer their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Even if the small village on maps little place, in the valley of the river-Ezulweni it is more than known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;After Esitjeni goes, as is the light&quot; say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And if the 8733 kilometres to Heidelberg, crow flies back to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room in the old city, you can see it as well. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger has proof that it is on the planet Mercury ice. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 meters thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US-25 NASA has the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, such as from three on Thursday in the magazine &quot;Science&quot; published studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger have proof that there are constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is an ice sheet. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This is to be at least 30 cm and possibly even up to 20 meters thick. </seg>

<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and have been 23 children, aged 136 years he fathered a daughter. </seg>

<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds odd from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult, driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan. </seg>

<seg id="2025"> But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often in the press, and most people this does not seem to care. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here hates it, Anders Breivik still name - those racist extreme right, which last year 77 men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it only refers to the &quot;incident&quot; on 22 July. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peaceful country to such brutal murders is capable of. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main responsibility for today ’ s wealth of Norway is since the early 1970 ’ s growth is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are a, as they say, sensible people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Her English is like that of most people here spotless. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway is dealt with very carefully with its oil wealth, a large part of the Branchenerträge is for the benefit of future generations in a special fund. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As in the years before the Great Depression cast all the money is that they do not, Norway had his wallet firmly closed. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we in the winter skiing and hiking can go in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And, of course,&quot; Rakfisk eat, it deals with easy laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I stand in the snow, I am for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> So a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat I enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations, the Rakfisk-organising a dinner, where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish Geruchssinne can vote. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a Live-TV-circuit with fly to make television presenters, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;You have the score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Here are our points, &quot;Amazing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> To applause and laughs. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the Chinese. </seg>

<seg id="2050"> Mexico ’ s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While Mexico ’ s future President Enrique Pena Nieto on his taking office, Will Grant of the BBC analysed the challenges ahead of it and the mixed emotions of his people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently, the traffic in Mexico-City especially bad. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even on better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, the several important traffic routes into the capital absperrt and on the streets for chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The goal was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but demonstrators from Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico can economically well test, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, who in the last six years, already 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence,&quot; Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US-American President Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before joining with the US-president went on an equal footing, Pena Nieto as Governor of his Heimatstaats Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, part of the country, which surrounds the capital, are the opinions about the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered, for example, rely on him. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Inhabitants of the resort of write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In order to reach the city, you can go to one of the motorways, Pena Nieto and build a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which gave it here. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plaques with his name also depend on the outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect him real and lasting change&quot;, as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party, the PRI Pena Nietos works. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, as regards the security and the economy is concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside capture of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The allegations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, especially if he but also someone who can listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In formalized, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico-City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems are crucial in the municipality of urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military switched to the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On a stains Barrens near a large landfill were in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women left behind. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico, about 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which for their violence and the murders of innocent women is notorious. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not properly. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But, in the worst case have his government closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a Betonbau, typical of the old quarter, Irinea Buendia with tears when she me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But their family believes that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies washed,&quot; recalls Senora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already used. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While their mother recounts their history, looks out from the wall, a picture of Mariana on us. It is next to a cross, a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But it is precisely this, so the family, have denied them until now. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want to simply accept their verdict and the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that is not possible, if it so many flaws and failings,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime suffered, and the new president has promised during his term, especially with this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as president he is as it was as governor,&quot; says the PRI congressmen Olvera-in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But, just afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning did not complained of mistreatment </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Bradley Mannings contradicts the prosecution allegations that he had been mistreated in prison </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The hearing deals with the Mannings Militärgefängnis in Quantico, Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense seeks a rejection of the indictment in too harsh prison conditions </seg>

<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors on Friday, has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - indicted for the biggest disclosure of confidential information of the US-American history - missed several opportunities to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in Militärhaft to complain. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> At a third: Mannings during a hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents to weekly visits, the Mannings prison officers during a period of detention in Quantico, Virginia, no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> One day before the third, the following a request from the defence to reject the charge, Manning was held by the harsh detention - had already been punished enough Manning testified that he had considered the suicide in prison. </seg>

<seg id="2106"> The material was published on the Internet by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never Manning as the source of the information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his imprisonment in the Quantico-Militärgefängnis had filled from July 2010 to April 2011 she had increased prison conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The officials, Manning questions and wrote his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> As Fein him on Friday to the forms, that he gave Manning to the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment by the institution as a whole as &quot;very professional&quot; had judged. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms, so Fein contained no complaints about abuse, although the official Manning directly to his treatment had consulted. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had his concerns expressed orally and the officials had discussed this with him and to deal with these. They are not, however, have been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote (after meeting the reservations)&quot; No problems &quot;, and not necessarily that meant that I absolutely nothing,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he is not complaining about his treatment, in January 2011 with a committee, which met him a few months previously referred to a form Suizidgedanken. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning answered during this meeting, his intention had been to his Beobachtungsstatus &quot;prevention of injury&quot; to begin by downgrading. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said that it had him from this restrictive status - a level below the Selbstmordgefährdung - to his and the protection of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to convince people that I went well, and on the prevention of injury Beobachtungsstatus (...) in order to get rid of a higher quality of life, in my view, to achieve,&quot; Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he nearly two months before he was detained in July 2010 in the prison of the next Quantico in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and was due to the heat even unconscious. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world, would be burdensome. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world shrank at Camp Arafjon, on these cage together,&quot; said Manning on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in the cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> When he was moved to Quantico Manning did most of his days in a small cell - spent at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> We only have a mattress, a blanket, flip-Flops, clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he had tried to remain in motion, because the day whether it is forbidden to sleep, or even just lie down. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> He always have to sleep with light from the outside in his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If he turned up at night and guards his face, I have not seen him so that he can be used again zurückdreht. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> In January 2011, Mannings lawyer Mannings formally objected to the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011, Manning in the Militärgefängnis of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> On Friday, the judge Manning also asked to an accusation that he collected in his statement on Thursday, so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico sleep and a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning had testified that he had during this counting never had the opportunity to meet with his blanket. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> In the survey on Friday, Manning, he had a command of his guard down from the ceiling, he would have been able to cover drop. He should, however, that no one had asked him. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning testified that he had in the previous night was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show a officials that he poses no risk to themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning told the officials said that he would have the waistband of his underwear or his flip-Flops can use to themselves, but this is not done. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning said, are his underwear, flip-Flops and glasses removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge and his Hafterlebnisse at least be drastically reduce Haftmaß, he should be at his trial before the military tribunal. This is scheduled for early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defence has stated that Manning is minor offences committed guilty, while other charges, which will be seen as too extreme to be challenged. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. From the prosecutor will be a justification of the detention conditions expected. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions for all among the highest security measures in Quantico stored prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national Verteidigungsinformationen and the theft of public property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> He is found guilty in all of the charges he is facing a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My Mexican-American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Many people are due to the lack of opportunities, forced to leave Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them in hard times, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico-City, I had just crossed the hall and was at the passport control, when perplexity in me. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues: One for &quot;Wochos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and became my whole life &quot;Mexicans called&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York &quot;Italians call&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I opted for &quot;Mexican-Amerikanisch.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But it was here Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for acronyms or hyphens. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, at least well enough for me in this language at both ends of an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I am also not going. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about the moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House in order to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda of all those issues which we expect if the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans today, with a high probability remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trade bloc in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto vowed that the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even if he was no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never wasting a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem rifle, forced them to more than half of their territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans in centuries and not in minutes, are reminders of this event. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, once a US-government officials also only Pit criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans afflict the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children go to Montezumas. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about resentment? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the land of opportunity, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix and San Antonio live, is that at one point in our family tree, a person may be a parent or Großelternteil - no chance in Mexico and offered immigrated in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, this person was a profile - folks, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And although we may be living the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes perhaps vague, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is clearly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> We are also aware that there are not many members of the Mexican ruling class. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a memento of a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Their view is our very existence is a symbol of the failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families in Mexico have failed, though they were not. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would not now see trapped behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States had slipped, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are, and Mexican Americans take this resent them. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans that I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> You enjoy the best of both worlds, but in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As I should learn during my journey, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, which use their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We are supposed to our American colleagues tell you how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many wounded feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, in view of the unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I fear that you alone, Amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States to deal with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans a grudge kings, as their family members only, not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In the midst of the usual apportioning blame, countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza, near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But, while the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historical conflict, is changing the Middle East around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this mayhem. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate may find their end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that is not yet lost </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first blush, optimism, given the current situation is not appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the on 21 November have agreed ceasefire continues, this fighting the hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, although his group even large losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas-leader killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now has not managed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, that of the rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And the Hamas-leader could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As Islamists in the Arab world has grown in influence Hamas have powerful and wealthy friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was seen as Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally, has taken to the Hamas party - just as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Jubelnde Hamas-followers believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren characteristics before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan, where Hamas-allies the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, the single Germany&apos;s most densely populated districts and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years, only had little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more verschwägert Volksansichten. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could be Hamas as a player, even from Israel and the United States can not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas is no more. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defence system, &quot;Iron Dome&quot;, has been able to test and many of the Hamas-missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while, Israel is a quiet sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Diplomatic believe the United States unshaken by its position, many European countries have Hamas blamed for the latest escalation. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel is there in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza strip-since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country is still relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the control in the West Bank, and thus in the body of any Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, which is in breach of international law, but always have been declared to be developed further. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is well-. His Likud Party, ahead of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why this cunning Palestinians nanny and leave them to their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they actually have control over the West Bank, would it not just as their supporters also fire rockets in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better that they are behind the wall at bay and punish, should they dare to raise the heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the hardliners. However, the Arab Spring could thwart them. </seg>

<seg id="2241"> The taken Israel ’ s is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower is hardly the new Arab governments in the overhaul of its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust a ceasefire may be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Even the Israelis should think long term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world, timid steps in the direction of democratisation that Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Already the repression is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in the Gaza strip-over the years are increasingly its diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a push from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The right answer is one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: Two states, in which Israel areas for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders greater influence on the enforcement of this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt must now share with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of arms in the Gaza strip-stop and is better placed than ever before to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> That would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state as done with the forthcoming application for UN-observer status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama, too, must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were as much a part of the Choir. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australian laws in force for single cigarette </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and infected body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all promoted </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The world ’ s first laws for single cigarette and Tabakverpackungen are in Australia, which will come into force brand logo and colours, replaced by neutral olive lid, moreover, with dramatic images printed sick body parts, and by cigarette smoke infected infants and children. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Of the various health warnings and frames apart from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, printed in identical, smaller font. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> Australia is the world ’ s most stringent rules for Tabakverpackungen. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Australian Federal Government wants to young people smoking, by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> This is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26, to smoke, with 99% probability that will not start. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;One can already see young age in children that they understand the message, the tobacco companies with their brand of trying&quot; to apply, so Bundesgesundheitsministerin Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that have shown that children, for example, the crown logo with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia Raucherquoten is one of the lowest in the world, and the changes only slightly at the profits of the multinationals, other countries will have similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> So, with the laws of the fighting, which would benefit to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters are far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others, however, say that the legislation boosting their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and Silikondeckeln to cover the unbearable packaging, has grown enormously since the trusts, British American Tobacco, Britain &apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian court with their dispute the laws failed. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and await new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us this is a good deal. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to the experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in the community, in which the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian laws, tobacco companies from the TV-banned from advertising, they act as Sportsponsoren and most traders forced in shops are no longer cigarettes. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has advertising banned by local businesses and pages, but it has no influence on international sides. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Whoever tobacco markets and has only a small area, in order to promote its products to the Internet is not around,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman an increase in reports about brands noted that &quot;normal people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It has to be asked: Is this merely a private person who likes this big-Marlboro cigarettes place that it even includes a video - or has a marketing-agency to do with it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on marketing focusing on the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far as Ukraine, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, in order to pay for the new rules - those countries to complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair Handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO-decision is expected in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Plibersek, the government talks with other countries who are considering similar Verpackungsgesetze. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country in 2001, the photographic warnings. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> These have now been in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers are proudly. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You simply take a turn and the box away,&quot; says Victor El Hage, when buying a packet of cigarettes on the printed a photo with a Mundtumor. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be honest, there is only one reason why I would cease, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operators of which &quot;King of the Pack&quot; in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging have the filling his shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I used an hour for a delivery einzusortieren, now I need four&quot;, says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government could have simply to completely ban cigarettes - then we would have told us well, that was&apos; s, we close visibly angry,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful, even to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving, I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I do not want to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies Shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But more and more academics and lead Kindesentwicklungsexperten boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> So far as they are concerned, it is for us, and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This is the brain, forced into interesting thoughts to lose the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because most of us today is almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are no longer the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> The boredom, so we should welcome with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I will come back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increasing leisure has developed. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011), the not so. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Indeed, the boredom has a very long history&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Pompejis adorns the walls, a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways is defined and discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After a long reading of literature and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, &quot;a satisfactory activity, but not to want to be able to define&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom is different from apathy that that the person is not considered, but would like to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to &quot;disruption of the Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the sense that the time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom is almost as such as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions related to bored people could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we have is boring, even if we just have difficulties to us. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention&quot; - used to: &quot;The idle mind: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention&quot; that &quot;in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues at an earlier experiment, in which participants a band, a person who listened to read a Magazinartikel. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud TV from the neighbouring area, which has nothing to do with the content. Other heard it to lower volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group these noises do not hear them. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who heard the barely audible television, said, more boring than the other two groups - feel they have had problems to concentrate, for they could find no reason and wrote its difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task to focus the attention of the disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> If, on the other hand, a monotonous work - &quot;as the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband can distract, music and help to feel not bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we know now that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people can combat physically attentive remain. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who must herumhampeln learn more and more information than those who are forced to sitting still,&quot; Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We will all eventually boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly tedious film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people bore more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980s to Langeweileanfälligkeit a &quot;scale&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale, you will find statements such as &quot;Many things that I must do repeat themselves and are monotonous&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of such scales, researchers found that boys more boring than girls, as Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, regarding the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But teenagers are generally a pretty abgespannter bunch. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991 led Reed Larson, professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the comes from doing the homework were bored, while 23% said that to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents said, is to feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increased or decreased. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> It is certain, however, that &quot;the youth is perceived as very boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their Alltagsablauf. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Back to my Ursprungsfrage: Is boredom healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in the extreme case leads them to that people extreme physical risks and gambling, or drugs to relieve studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, of the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom wants the brain a say that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain knows what you are not always the best should do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If a boring and it is this energy used to playing guitar and to cook, will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can for happiness in the short term, but in the long term they dissipate. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Whoever his bored child, then, an iPad, it can while away from the boredom, and it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;Self is transferred from one situation to the other.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The child learns not just to entertain, but also in other areas receive more self. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should also not to take a critical view of them. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our aim should be to us away from the ongoing activities and Technologieberieselung structure. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds as we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that the people of truth just look for a way to switch off and relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with, if the noise even has fallen silent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanagesetz </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year old community college-student and footballer Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado on trial for a crime in this state, which soon will be legally: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a pipe with which he smoked. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Orozco said he and some friends were in it with a car in Lamar, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officers had found marijuana in the car, Orozco for possession of drugs and summoned Drogenutensilien - excusable, each with a fine of 100 US-dollar are provided, and received a court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities to legalise marijuana for personal use, is the answer in hundreds of smaller takes less than the law on location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of offences, which are to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, who dropped similar measures that have already been approved. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities are pursuing adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession in a small extent. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws in the weeks to come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced, existing Marihuanadelikte and quote still people in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several cities, to vote in favour of the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains about new, state licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is developing so rapidly that I do not even know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J. (, police chief in Aurora, the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington scratch themselves perplexed at the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for a guide to establish a licensing systems for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, it is of the opinion that Colorado in any case is ahead of the majority of States, which concerns the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only for medical purposes and then to the Eigenkonsum legalised. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore right to orientation,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith is there to that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent, which we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, called I-502, on 6 December in force and the conclusion of a grey area, in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the property is legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be resolved in this time, about how the government target of a &quot;fair access to&quot; which marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;There will be no more difficult, a site for a licensed Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the area of Seattle&quot;, says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the &quot;Center for Legal cannabis&quot;, a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, Chief (his staff in Aurora a E-Mail, in which he said that the prosecutor would smaller Marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years ago no longer, and that the police are now &quot;no&quot; to get for this offence. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Chief (added that the police continue to urban targets for regulation of growers of medical marijuana will continue to enforce and drug traffickers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In WELD County in northern Colorado Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck represents a stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly to consumers for withdrawing. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana on trial, although many also for other offences were charged. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our agency has the duty to prosecute offences, which are to Tatzeitpunkt crimes was,&quot; Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions, even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana-initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, shows adults for the possession of small amounts of no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Pete Bezirksstaatsanwalt Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to abandon all outstanding Besitzverfahren. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not believe that I don ’ t waste my time to enforce the law, until it changes,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And the contradictory reactions in the whole state under local officials encouraged a profound dichotomy in relation to the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> At Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver to Marihuanadelikte represents the defendants in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organisation on the reform of Marihuanagesetzen. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute people for the legalization still cannot accept&quot;, he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The first states that small amounts of marijuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national test-cases for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials to an era of legal sales, they also prepare waiting nervously on orders of the federal government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level remains a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the justice ministry will give in. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several spectacular arrests of consumer and medical marijuana sellers of the Federal Government has launched the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former drugs policy-adviser of the Obama-government believes that investigators are probably no doors in order to seize small quantities of drugs, but are likely to resist under the new legislation legal, regulated marijuana-shops to tolerate. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado are not even that the federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana-shops, although this only open in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Montrose decided last week, a city in the West, a six-month ban, the likely next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to end up in a position in which we license and then someone at the federal level have a huge problem&quot;, as Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against this change in the law. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We then, for what the municipality decided and not afterwards, for which the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Still, many questions unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was bullied because I am Tory </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Students of today not only for their views are attacked </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It has always been my greatest dreams, a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had those University, which I once for the largest Wissenstempel in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance -. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study, history, I had my suitcase packed again and so the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke down in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> In the Evening Standard, I would be misplaced, because I would have had a problem with that peers in neighboring rooms sex. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author of A N Wilson explained these, I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> But the truth was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, ran because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> We had asked for one reason only harassed - a reason, in this alleged cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel seemed: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, current reportedly suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The organised and rising hatred of Tory-students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions, that a group of them last week called for the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, it will be because of their political views often &quot;actively isolated, personally and for declared undesirable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They are calling for a place in the Gleichberechtigungskomitee their College, in order to ensure that their opinions freely can be expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary about broadcasting political students on BBC Two, &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot;, the Tories as eccentrics and neoNazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It has been shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student union of the University of Oxford in a Rolls-Royce and with silver suit and silberbesetztem prelude walking stick. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> At other universities say conservative students, they are called &quot;scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The 20-year old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative ’ at the University of Nottingham in a Sunday newspaper, said: &quot;There is a growing Linkstendenz at universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us on Fridays at all. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is &quot;unpleasant&quot;. The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford says she at JCR-members a growing opposition to students of the moderate right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This is a danger to the intellectual debate and for the wellbeing of members,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> In my first weeks in Oxford I was such a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> As incredibly shy 18-year I was in September 1986 arrived. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university had voted in favour, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, because of cuts in higher education no title. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the incoming-week, in the new students and tutors, I received a foretaste of future events. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of Tory-students not only did it, but even with joy. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues, such as the office, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime-South Africa found their way into the rooms of the native Tutoriums. </seg>

<seg id="2447"> &quot;I propose that in your free time you take a few Französischstunden - so if you are not too much with your social activities are busy,&quot; growled at intervals me Pitt. </seg>

<seg id="2449"> On this evening in college, I was sitting alone at the dinner, as I typed someone lightly on the shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a Englischstudent from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is what it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected of Tory, will be harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most incoming Tory-give-, supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local pub I tried later on. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I do not agree with everything with Mrs. Thatcher was of the same opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A university entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the current Eton College as a conservative, said to me: &quot;You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are polluted. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students shared his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How did Tories sex?&quot; Asked me one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The beat, or each other? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt so how homosexuals from the more liberal legislation of the United States had to have felt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I ever succeed at Oxford University to lead a normal life? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would cost only after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> If I am the Labour-party and suppress my natural inclinations? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years before me lay, gradually, before my inner eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only tutor, who is openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was not only for it to be hated, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy speeches and had written for them. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated the place, found him provincial and narrow and rejected him for being an-deterministic Geschichtsperspektive. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;You will not be happy here,&quot; he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started between Oxford and the house of my parents to commute and found refuge in outward-looking friends and family members in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> My father told me that I hated it, and why I did it. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> He seemed disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his time in the 40s were all political views. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But it is the best place in the world&quot;, he said sheepishly. </seg>

<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they 70 kilos of brimstone on the steep, rocky paths. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people, for their work, and the hell is other work quite literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miner who earn their lives by using sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day he must go down to the bottom of the crater, where the advance of the sulphurous gas from the earth in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After he has extracted large Schwefelsteine, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them into two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 meters from the top of the volcano, which is up to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, while the balance and the steps have to be careful, so that they do not slip and crash. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that every step you can kill a French tourist, as it happened, the years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miner of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> On top of the hill, they pave the path between the tourists who like Zirkusaffen photograph them and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales that are a Minengesellschaft a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters has set up </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The company is PT sweet Ngrimbi since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, whom they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur is charged. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar is used. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As we normally wear 70 kg, we get to any way about psychiatry rupees (3.8 euros),&quot; explains us Anto, usually three routes on the day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> For each track it requires three hours that he is completely managed, at the end of the day, he then 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros). </seg>
<seg id="2570"> What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times as much as he deserves to be in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The Tagelohn here, where the miners in the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day will be paid and the average monthly income two million rupees (167), is very high,&quot; explains the carrier, as bricklayers on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There he earned 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason, in Indonesia as important as the sulphur is: &quot;I have a girl from Bali, where they are married Hindus, and I have brought them to Java, to convert to Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, and his eyes are often a coughing fit because of the toxic gases irritated. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> The 27 year old Anto has been three years of his life in the Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur at the first mark him, even though he has left his face with a mask and Spezialbrille. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto has asthma, breathes a coughing fit with difficulty, and his eyes are often due to the poisonous gases from the volcano irritated. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he paid for the achievement of his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I will have two years of work, because I have a shop or Spanish or French would like to learn,&quot; he promises in a more than reasonable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> This likeable and smart, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guide, waiters or at the reception desk of a hotel, but instead he performed the work of a Tragesels. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and every morning at 2 p.m. at night, because the sulfur also means, where his distinctive yellow color turn in the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The shadow of challenging, it rises in the light of a small, on his helmet, which he bought from his own money into the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 carriers can download on Kraterboden the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite their large profits, the Minengesellschaft the Schwefelabbau mechanized, not in order to cut costs and returns the providers that are working on their own account and paid by weight, no equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> You also get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature parks along with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists, the demand for photographing of the volcano and human Tragesel. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work is for the animals and not for the people protesting&quot; Madrusin, a cobby, 42 years old carrier, the three decades since leaving the school on Kawah Ijen works. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, &quot;as long as it is&quot; because he is the money for the upbringing of his three children aged between 10 and 18. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not retire, I will die here, because of the volcano was all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Even if the sulphur burns the throats and eyes itch, if the wind suddenly turns and the miner can become trapped in the thick columns from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, apart from the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which is distorted by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> With the basket on his back is merely Unainik with his 53 years in a position to 50 kg. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his companions 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, the three trucks over a Ziegenpfad between the bush to the warehouse in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away. </seg>

<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the oldest, with its 30 years ago as a sulfur-bearers. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the meagreness, generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: The those who as human Lastesel on Kawah Ijen work. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore needs babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Blame the Singapurer to ensure that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and bringing up children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore must grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfil our released and we create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The sentences are part of a rapper-songs, the local slogans such as &quot;pushing will be a&quot; good &quot;(loaf) in the oven to the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency BBH, who shot the video, respects the hope that the advert in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of the music, the people wanted to implement its &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for Internet, we therefore had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> When propagated, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we get to grips with. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with or under the organisation of speed-dating-evenings (fast flirting). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were led creative, but not necessarily to success. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> Therefore we thought: Why do we not something as creatively as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year they 1,300 US-dollar for political action in order to encourage more people to have children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything has had little success. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a richer, more city state in the southeast of Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> According to his national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time these rate was about 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why get the Singapurer no more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this in a &quot;better training&quot; and &quot;greater opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has the people except to marry and to form a family far more options in terms of goals and priorities,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in the social realities have higher number of single parents and the delay of the marriage and births, the result of which contributed to the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy that led to a dramatic increase in the influx, in order to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for that they keep wages down and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year boxes since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, an attempt to the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate the known impact on the economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy, Singapore has also unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to ensure that not so many small flats are being built. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> She also has an impact on the housing market. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to control, which are known as &quot;Schuhschachteln&quot; and built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great success in terms of sales. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is the concern that the lifestyle of the living alone, and that they can promote the construction companies tendency, large apartment for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its &quot;Schuhschachteln&quot; much faster than larger units sell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are for days or even weeks faster than the larger units sold out. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This means that it is for our cash flow are much better. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> He, however, is that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which previously put obstacles when they were too many small units within a project to build. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in national birthrate might cause, is in talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are highly stressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, so it takes to say&quot; by many a young managers. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The kids can others. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;For me, it is important for my own money and time to have another,&quot; says about twenty years old man. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women of their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons that they have no children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, as can the government still so much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The offline Private offline is online privately </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Privacy </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary is the characteristic privately or &quot;the area of private life, where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference,&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2658"> Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> Me, I reported on Twitter to express myself and interesting tweets to write. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> &quot;I do not know if someone, I invite you to only high,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> &quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance, or with friends talk&quot; is he. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He asked replies that he never accept an invitation from a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Even if someone empfähle a stranger, he would ignore this. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of the 14-year anniversary José is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager, user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he gives to the people, not to know that he has added his friends list. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> &quot;It scares me, not because we have something in common, for example, music&quot;, he gives. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> After the boy has given him no one hints or him after his address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> &quot;They harassed me or if someone asks me, do I remove him from my account is simply,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José got in contact with Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The boys are not unknown experience, which is now called Cyberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The friend of a friend was in a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They threatened him and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;He has never know who it was,&quot; he assured. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> According to José has not closed the account of the victim. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> &quot;He has only privately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explained a series of steps to create a user account sure to configure. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge would this boy photos of friends upload in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic to me or him one wants to dust. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;But I know that this Cyberbullying,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was conceived as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these pages, but the rules have changed,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explains that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Master-title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work &quot;digital natives and Immigrants&quot; these words of explanation of the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they are, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them that we still get themselves,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He explains that this is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand that they have a defined criteria, distributed, published or can be said, and this in an age where the maturity of this is not enough.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be fussy when it is most important to them, to be liked, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which privacy is, to ask them questions that it. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell you, they should do not, does not work&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras then mentions a number of options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, if you like, if you published a photo of you, as you have published by a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what the other about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Do you have the other people asked for permission before, if you have photos of celebrations labelled? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And one more question: What you need to know, do in any moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply for the social networks,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, says that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If they all sections understand they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one user on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age, or what you must share or publish&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, the children of the lesson &quot;Thou shalt not speak with strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Completion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The Sixth Summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced in advance and in theory of the seven present leaders should be signed. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe tried repeatedly, access to the signed document to the Sixth Annual meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the Unasur. Sources in the heads of state and Präsidentenkanzlei initially told that they would be handed over to the exam, said afterwards, however, that for some time on the website of the Peruvian government would be published. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> If you have questions on the text they gave that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press was presented. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Journalists access to information about the summit was limited to any time. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, in the press room only the image of the Präsidententreffens without tone with the message &quot;private session, limited Audio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few information among the journalists have been floating around, even some of the present government of the Unasur meeting, but not from the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The only document that during the day, was the list of participating president, what with the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media caused discomfort, calling for more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Then sent the presidency of Peru, the media an E-Mail with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but the statement by Humala and not the official document at the end of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October was Peru hosts of the Third Summit South America - Arab states (ASPA), and also on this occasion was despite more emphatically call by the press, the so called Lima Declaration, which had previously announced, just published. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA you can be certain that the document was published on Tuesday. </seg>

<seg id="2717"> &quot;We are the judgment about the differences of opinion that we are currently follow this international court,&quot; said Humala and implement, together with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile was, is and remains a country that keeps to the international laws, peaceful solutions for disputes, agreements and international courts regulations,&quot; adds Piñera and gave Humala with a hand in front of the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ, after Colombia for a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which there seemed to be a serious error, action against the agreement of Bogotá had lodged itself, in which it agreed to the judgments of the International Court of Justice. </seg>

<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, which since 2011, following the withdrawal of its President Fernando Lugo of the Unasur is excluded, participated in the meeting did not take part. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and the summit ended shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The head of state read the final document, in which it said that 16 decisions and the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment of $17 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> The decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur &quot;significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, and we will make the decisions on the right of residence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that action would be taken &quot;cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and against organised, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and in order to improve in the event of natural disasters to act together and efficiently.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe must &quot;economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains take, but should serve to expand our production capacity and our people to a better future,&quot; added Humala added. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided that a number of 31 emblematic projects to give priority to the spatial compounds in South America and especially in rural and border areas are to improve... and therefore our countries unite and new Wirtschaftsformen open,&quot; said the Peruvian President in a statement read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> In these projects would have five Peruvian on the Querachsen its territory from the coast to Brazil, and which are two to ensure a better link with Ecuador, though he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The final document also took on the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for his resumption in the Union of South American Nations&quot;, from which it is currently impossible. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America continues to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that was emphasised at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, said the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meetings that he Mexico on Saturday in a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to the maritime dispute after one of Bogotá in question the judgment of the ICJ respectfully to treat. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Maybe I will tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega hit,&quot; Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua talks with Nicaragua are necessary,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope the President Ortega can say that this matter is so civilized and respectful as possible,&quot; added Santos will handle. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend, at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, to be present. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit, too in the defence minister of the block to the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even if the latter is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America during the integration of the citizens have to learn,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, with &quot;South America actually can learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, of the Sixth Summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) attended nations, which took place in Lima, said the state television in Peru that Europeans &quot;in the Second World War and in other clashes were killing&quot; and &quot;virtually a homeland today.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as has been the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors that want a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The president of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the premise that the influence of the United States to reduce those states and to take into account that the agreement of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who commit themselves to teach something never and, in return, we are signing the South Americans are everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the interamerikanische Commission for Human Rights, headquartered in Washington, and is funded by the United States,&quot; he said in reference to the political asylum, the Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has conceded. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa said that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights has fulfilled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it had been &quot;reasoned assumptions that Assange extradited to a third country and its procedure will not be observed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish justice, which required him to its territory, an interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while &quot;to the Swedish case law that allowed through a video conferencing over the message of Ecuador in London would be executed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that the danger that the health and the mental state of Assange would be affected. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador has informed me that he is, however, a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious&quot;, said the head of state of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There was, however, a risk that he take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;This would adversely affect the health of all people,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the asylum, the Assange for the month of June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, the granting of a Freibriefs, by which he was travelling in Ecuador, and that that is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe &apos;s. He emphasised that it had been with London talks to resolve the captive founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, this word in this case we are not, however, there have been constant discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedure leads to various European authorities,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;if Britain morning this licence is, however, in my opinion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or on Skype up and interrogated, as it allows the Swedish justice and in other cases, is the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took advantage of the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said to confirm that what he does not tolerate, &quot;the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is not more of such journalists &quot;and not by the bankers or hegemonic and dominated spießbürgerlichen countries&quot;, and took away at a reelection that he &quot;will deepen the revolution to lead the way in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the (at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism &quot;remain firm and no opportunism and must not be allowed to grant a legal coup&quot; because &quot;the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The president of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua were highly irregular in the advantage they gave the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries to negotiate for &quot;absolutely justified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> This judgment is not being implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American country. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are unavoidable, but they are in pursuit of a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be comprehensively, so that they can overcome and look to the future. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He is just as familiar to a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the Court of Justice and said that &quot;it is Latin America is right to call for international bodies, both countries to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, for his third term in a row, he gave at the possibility that he &quot;with a lot of optimism and, although it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa said that if he was losing the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Makes has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances such as in Ecuador these socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement had the belief that I was, the probable victory guaranteed, I must therefore this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I should win, it would be my final period as President, then I would prefer from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This applies also, if we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;This is definitely,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned, for a routine treatment have travelled there, and that is that he would again after the election campaign could travel to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It means, in any case, a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader took today in Lima on 6 Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), with the call to a higher regional integration was stopped by for a sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the SRC: HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bombshell,&quot; he says, referring to the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor with no discernible success &quot;tried to mitigate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it in front of his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to just about his illness and started to take care of themselves; and to inform this with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV-unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several struggles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio-living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which for 22 years at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At that time, it avoided even the director a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But there are still many people in the clinic, who know nothing of their illness and in which the virus damage has already exhausted and their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, that is, after the first reported cases, &quot;means the great success today that the survival of a patient who in the treatment and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV-unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April of this year, backed by a respected scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life of the extent of the impairment of the immune system of the people at the start of treatment, and that those who had not greater opportunities that are dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with one count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, mean that the above, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in this sense, &quot;can be easily 75 years old, as long as he is under control,&quot; said this expert. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> This progress in order to be able to properly, I must point out that the life expectancy of Mexicans live, on average, 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the yes)), it is nevertheless true that since the release of the AIDS 60 percent of the national database captured patients have died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Alone in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people, and to the month of May this year are already 187 deaths; however, assured that it since 2005 universal access to antiretroviral medicines. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why is still people die? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, the problem of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the past 12 years ago we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people in an advanced state come, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a percussive statement: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all those people, where this is necessary, must be offered massive screening tests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (government committee to AIDS-prevention in Jalisco) and also the patient as Fabrizio, of its test carried out at a private laboratory, for the simple reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS-phase, and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which was one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different, if you know you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and would like to hear anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I have to die, then three times to burst&quot;, says one in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to out improvement, I ernähre me well, practise sport and take the drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> His parents now know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, as anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I work, go a lot, have an active, but responsible Sexleben, I respect to my health and the other person,&quot; Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony, in order to encourage those who today as part of the global AIDS-day scared. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They should make the test if they are to be. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, should they learn how to live like all the people responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens are large holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which was the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> On the specific places &quot;, the distribution of condoms were actually increased, and once made them individually, now they give us packages with a hundred piece, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The risk persons for new infections include the young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;What you need the?&quot; Is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal by social workers, in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He suggested that this inefficient distribution to move on; the condoms are not just behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions, who often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted the promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms are distributed under his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;Sexuality is not enough; the best way to use those who already have a sexual activity,&quot; he brought it to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key properties of Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is seen 4th place nationally in new and any accumulated AIDS-cases and in 13th place in relation to HIV. </seg>

<seg id="2877"> &quot;Those were my best years I have enjoyed most because I part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967 as Managing Director, whether it be Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy at BSN. </seg>
