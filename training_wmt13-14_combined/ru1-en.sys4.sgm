<seg id="8"> Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002, angrily reacted to the sentencing of the last of the conspirators, who appeared in court and declared that Umar Patek has to be shot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was today sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of explosive devices that were used during the terrorist attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He could be released within 15 years if will get parole. </seg>

<seg id="12"> He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that the man nicknamed &quot;subversive element&quot; for his reputation as a master of manufacturing explosive devices, should be sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This decision aggravated the painful memories of mother from Perth June Kortin, who lost his 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the attack, carried out by Patekom and his accomplices almost ten years ago. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Barely containing tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death. </seg>

<seg id="22"> Mr. Hughes said that Patek has to share the fate of the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage, by Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Muhlasa, who were executed four years ago. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Really, this guy deserves the death penalty. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To keep him alive, well, there&apos;s no reason to keep him alive. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Get 20 years after it killed 202 and injures hundreds-not so much. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Patek is the latest member of the terrorist attack in Bali, appearing before the Court. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but in the end, was detained in January 2011, in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where u.s. troops killed the former leader of Al-Qaida Osama bin Laden less than four months later. </seg>
<seg id="28"> During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence data showed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore the connection between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida. </seg>
<seg id="29"> &quot;He didn&apos;t give up,&quot; said Ms. Kortin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Until recently he was not sorry about how much grief he caused to other people. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The sentence imposed in the run-up to the 10-th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia. </seg>

<seg id="133"> All four suspects were at that time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the marketing of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Mersisajde, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>

<seg id="136"> Today at Liverpool Royal Court Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was covered in shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of Justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. </seg>

<seg id="148"> Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position, a criminal defense lawyer since he joined in too close relationships with specific clients. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Contact that we are talking about is not just a drug dealer and a drug dealer supplying drugs of its own counsel. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Some of his conversations, of course, would be legitimate, as he was their lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> However, this greatly changed the boundaries of conventional relations between lawyer and client. </seg>

<seg id="166"> Manufacturers of jet aircraft are about the width of the seats at stake, when large orders </seg>
<seg id="167"> Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft broke out a bitter dispute over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai air show this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The dispute revolves around the width of seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, but that the amount of allocated space for them to play a key role in the allegations about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard, which would seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class, but its main American rival Boeing says it must deal with the airline. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales all of larger versions of its twin-engine, long-haul aircraft, and the 17-21 November expected the potentially record-breaking orders. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Layout of the back of the plane — especially whether sit 9 or 10 people in a row — is central to the statements on the economic viability of new projects &quot;Airbus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, coming from the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed over 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 will transport in the economy class 350 people in seats 18 inches wide, located on the number 9. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues through advertising in the professional press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Now Airbus is drawn directly to the public before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing the financiers slide depicting three people in the restaurant, pressed to each other, under the name &quot;you would agree to that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> &quot;Boeing offers long haul flights on the seats are narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus Sales Director John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With the change of diet people gaining weight, but the aircraft seat is fundamentally unchanged. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the beginning of the 1970 &apos;s, when wide-body Boeing 747 has set standards of modern long-haul trips, and overseas century weight average American men aged 40 to 49 years old increased by 10 percent, according to the Health Department of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The average American male waist 21 century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the health service of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus says its competitor adheres to the concept of seat-1950 &apos;s, when the average waist of those recently called &quot;reactive public&quot;, was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus said it had commissioned a study, which indicates that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep to 53 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing disputed Airbus&apos;s figures on the sizes of seats and said that producers should not interfere with decisions about how the airlines find the balance between rates and amenities. </seg>
<seg id="184"> She said research shows that convenience compartment depends not only on the width of the seat. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;Everyone really is to let airlines of choice and opportunity to do what they feel they need to do to achieve success,&quot; said Boeing&apos;s specialist shops Kent Krejver. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don&apos;t want us to decide for them that will bring them profits. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For passengers, question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that could affect profits. </seg>
<seg id="189"> This dispute is worth keeping up with orders for aircraft valued at least $ 700 billion at catalog prices over the coming decades is enough to change the balance of American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As first reported in July, Reuters, arrangement of seats is exactly what fuels rivalries in the battle between the latest Jet aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Both Airbus and Boeing have about 20% increase profitability for one seat in their latest twin-engine, long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Boeing&apos;s performance claims are based in part on comparing 10-local 777X with original series 9-local 777 design series layout. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Gain in unit cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout, used currently. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;The reason that Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats and make his plane more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort, Airbus in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10-local numbers for existing 777-x indicates that many passengers prefer the tight seating arrangements which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Seat width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the Airbus proposal due to the threat from the th model 777, said Interior Salon specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing do not deliver, but offer a directory of suppliers, from which the airline can choose. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Traveling the world Jet dealers even carry a tape measure to check for competing design. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Praising the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense interior layout for low cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus is offering the A350 with 10-local numbers, but said that it already sold. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for further modifications of the salons, offering wider seats pass on some of their planes. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to &quot;take off&quot;, but it could divert attention from a wave of sales model 777X. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Oleynikov: one third of rural settlements near Moscow fully grant </seg>

<seg id="223"> Within two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="224"> RENAMO was once known by the rebel movement, which was supported at first by the white Rhodesia and then South Africa&apos;s apartheid-era Government in an effort to destabilize independent of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="225"> After the Armistice of 1992 onwards it became the opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back to full-scale conflict, but recent events had made nervous foreign investors and local residents. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore oil reserves of gas and coal deposits in the Northwest can bring more than $ 50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="228"> The ruling FRELIMO party, the leading political force since 1975, and Renamo party accuse each other of this tension. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Renamo party alleges that the Government was the instigator of recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala Province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, 17 October. </seg>
<seg id="230"> The attack on the former rebels then worsened when government troops attacked the base of RENAMO and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, told the newspaper the Financial Times, Fernando Mazanga, spokesman for RENAMO. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The Government blames Renamo in initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="232"> President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears of instability. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt &quot;looser&quot;, wishing to use &quot;all that was left of his force to try to prove that it can impose its own solutions to the Government. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Both Frelimo and Renamo insisted that they want to avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="235"> But fears have grown after reports that Mazanga said Renamo refusal from the 1992 peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id="236"> He told the Financial Times that the lack of agreement meant the party Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="237"> &quot;Our goal is to return to the negotiating table, but in all seriousness,&quot; said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tensions that intensified a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="239"> &quot;These are two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama), faced off against,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="240"> None of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is willing to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Party Renamo, which tries to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for next year. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Some commentators have interpreted this as an attempt to pressure the weakened the movement and financial bonuses to get concessions from the Government. </seg>
<seg id="244"> The share of votes for Renamo has been decreasing since 1992, while the new party, the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Mr. Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza, who must step down from the post next year, when his second term runs out, wants to destroy democracy in the country. </seg>
<seg id="246"> &quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the Presidency,&quot; said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It is unclear what Renamo, but she has already had devastating and sweeping attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway from the North to the South. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Most of the clashes took place in Sofala Province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal. </seg>
<seg id="249"> In June, Rio has suspended the use of railways by about week after Renamo has threatened an attack on the railway. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo will repeat that threat. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Renamo party wanted to &quot;warn the international community that the case in Mozambique are not going well,&quot; said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Instability has increased discontent with the Government, but many people also care about corruption, the slow pace of development and the frequent recent kidnapping, said Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;People think that the responsibility for the future of the country rests with the Government and the President, who must find the solution to these problems,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Omar Sultuan, a member of the demonstration, said people just want stability. </seg>
<seg id="255"> &quot;No one cares neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want a resumption of peace, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="274"> In addition, according to the Panel&apos;s recommendations, heavier devices should be located under the seat or in the overhead luggage compartments during take-off and landing. </seg>

<seg id="329"> &quot;The prosecution considers that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, it is not the kind of person who will stand near anyone&apos;s ever home, hoping to catch someone off guard, he is a man who likes to suggest a story for people to see what they will say,&quot; said Mr Edis. </seg>
<seg id="330"> He said the newspaper News of the World used three methods to investigate stories: hacking phones, shadowing and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The editor is personally implicated in the third. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, it just has to. </seg>

<seg id="335"> He said that no, we say: &apos; Oh, yes! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> Rumors about Clark&apos;s first novel attracted the attention of the edition of the News of the World, when the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polbi, said: &quot;don&apos;t waste your time with Charles. </seg>

<seg id="347"> In the databases of Russian law enforcers group Fraternal circle &quot;, to which Washington has ranked singer Gregory Leps, is not mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="348"> According to &quot;Interfax&quot; in law enforcement, after MEDIA reports emerged about the Ministry of Finance of the United States Gregory Leps in checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate &quot;Brotherly circle&quot; have been checked all the database, but this group has been found. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Dissemination of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called &quot;Russian mafia&quot; which supposedly operates abroad, believed in the power structures. </seg>
<seg id="350"> &quot;Even in the very name of &apos; Brotherly &apos; circle, there is a certain element of mystery, contains a hint of covert Lodge. </seg>

<seg id="358"> Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail the dog tied to its mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier studies have shown that satisfied the dog wags its tail, in the right side (from the point of view of the dog), while alarmed by the dog&apos;s tail pomahivaût mainly in the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that other members of the family canidae can notice these subtle differences in the wagging tail and to respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trent University, said: &quot;it is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain in different ways participate in the formation of the motivators that cause positive or negative emotions. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we have tried to look at it in other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that just as in humans, dogs, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres have different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To learn more about how the dogs react to versatile povilivaniâ tails of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals when they were watching movies about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the frequency of heartbeat and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other </seg>
<seg id="367"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we have shown dogs videos with dogs is a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors, and we were able to manipulate the movement of the tail and tail more left or right. </seg>
<seg id="368"> When the animals saw that otherwise nothing expressing dog tail has moved to the right (from the point of view of the vilâûŝej tail dogs), they remain completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they noticed that the tail is mainly left leaning (again from the point of view of the dog&apos;s tail vilâûŝej), their heart was and they looked alarmed. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In fact he believes that dogs have learned from their experiences what moves they should worry about, and what is not. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He said: &quot;If there is a number of meetings with the other dogs and often wobbling their tail to one side due to the more friendly behavior, and the right side gives a less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of that experience. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the veterinary school of the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to test whether a value for the left and right side. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year, a team of scientists from the University of Lincoln has found that dogs are turning heads left, if you look at the aggressive dog, and to the right, if you look at enough dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in the other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;the dog is more suited to the dog-robot when wobbling her tail went to the left, not the right, instead of becoming unnerved, the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian study&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully accept animals in the movies or the dog-robots as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It might be useful to study how the dogs react to these dogs, &quot;he explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> While on various mammals, there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and the dog is not an exception, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, given the ease with which they can be registered, probably, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes another. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Is the elite of Europe to do business with England? </seg>
<seg id="382"> Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relations with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="383"> To this end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The company lower than Govt estimates ... interviewed over 1000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of business in the United Kingdom by size, sector and region. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Findings of the survey will be a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, with particular attention to the countries which are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are deadlocked. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They want the Government gave priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead has spent time on the long and difficult process of reforming the unwieldy EU institutions. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When they were asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust to product legislation, most business leaders believed that control of these key competencies must be returned to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="389"> There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, the business representatives said that the cost of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the commercial area of Europe, agreed that even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The last and most exemplary-our survey managers revealed that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom conducted a course on the review of the Treaty and on relations with the EU, based on trade and not on politics. </seg>
<seg id="391"> This result, which was observed among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a &quot;significant change&quot;, which will return the power back to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="392"> The stakes are high-achieving changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide 16 percent shift in voting for it to remain in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The Prime Minister, there should be no doubt: this poll shows that British business supported his plan to review the conditions of membership in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="394"> It also shows that business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the balance of power back toward Britain. </seg>

<seg id="427"> Doctors are confident that the people of Siberia, particular attention should be paid to the diet in winter. </seg>
<seg id="428"> In this season of vegetarianism is particularly challenged. </seg>
<seg id="429"> In terms of our realities, there are high demands for food. </seg>
<seg id="430"> To stay warm, need a higher energy value. </seg>
<seg id="431"> &quot;If people are limits on animal products, respectively, the caloric value of it were buying,&quot; said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Agree dietitian Olga Poznyak. </seg>
<seg id="433"> She added that imported fruits and vegetables-not an option. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Man eat better with that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born. </seg>

<seg id="437"> According to her, that there are vegans, can really help a variety of grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, the frozen berries. </seg>
<seg id="438"> But it&apos;s definitely not enough for sufficient nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="439"> In the opinion of the physician-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulinoj, siberians in sufficient level of vitamins only from mid-August to mid-September. </seg>

<seg id="463"> Russia out of the struggle for urban pollution cars </seg>
<seg id="464"> Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in most megacities in the world since the second half of the 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> As a rule, it was either on their refurbishment and expansion of highways, or about trying to reduce the demand for automobile travel, vehicle number and time of their use. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Widely known example of Singapore which has strict quotas for growth in the private car, and the right to acquire them, purchased at auctions. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Its price is two to three times higher than the price of the car itself. </seg>
<seg id="468"> European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry to the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introduce the so-called green zone, where the only vehicles allowed to enter with a certain èkoklassom, who use the fuel quality (including biofuels or electric cars). </seg>
<seg id="470"> Beijing&apos;s environmental protection agency, for example, approved in the year 2012, &quot;five-year plan for clean air&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (about US $ 40 billion). </seg>
<seg id="471"> According to Kommersant, the Director of the Division of transport pollution control of the Municipal Environment Protection Bureau of Beijing Li Kunšeng, the main objective of the five-year plan to reduce the leading air pollutants on 20-35% by the year 2017, growth in the number of private cars to a level no greater than 6 million (5.2 million), as well as the increase of no more than 5% of fuel use per vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="472"> According to the Agency, now vehicles in Beijing responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Among the major measures, the restriction of the use of motor vehicles, as well as the introduction of additional tax for car owners. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Among other things, the city&apos;s &quot;Green Plan&quot; includes an accelerated compared to the rest of the country transition to European standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and labelling of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of the incentive of financial programmes, replacement of old cars for hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and restricted), development of public transport (including broadband). </seg>
<seg id="475"> The road of innovation of Beijing also include a ban on all private vehicle traffic within the fifth ring road (the capital of the REPUBLIC of CHINA their six) one day a week (this information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issue of registration plates for vehicles based on the lottery (for example, in the year 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing amounted to only one-third the number of 2010 year). </seg>
<seg id="476"> In accordance with the State program &quot;environmental protection at the 2012-2020&quot;, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (138 year 2012). </seg>
<seg id="477"> According to the Ministry, in 2011, to &quot;mobile sources&quot; accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="478"> In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times greater than the industry, and, in St. Petersburg, nine times. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In the RUSSIAN FEDERATION is only beginning to think about the possibilities of a restrictive regulation of cars on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="480"> Director of the Institute of transport economics and transport policy HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures to suppress demand for car travel is notoriously unpopular, they can be accepted by the society only if their full universality. </seg>
<seg id="481"> In the case of Moscow a unique problem with the structure of its truck fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory actions-Office and personal cars, and cars &quot;privileged&quot; users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand. (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow). </seg>
<seg id="482"> Recently the urbanists of ECOM Center in St. Petersburg prepared a study which examines the balance between residential buildings in urban areas, the area of the road surface and the number of motor vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The main findings of the researchers: city centre roads have two times less required, and most motorists living in the Center, do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time in parking lots or on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="484"> As a result of a build parking, and car storage, not to expand and reduce traffic (so that the streets were more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placement of personal transportation within the buffer zone of the historic centre (total area about 3212 HA, covering a number of the central districts of the city). </seg>
<seg id="485"> The fuel price rise will lead to a tax maneuver, which involves raising the mining tax (TAX) on oil simultaneously with reduction of export duties and excises. </seg>
<seg id="486"> According to experts, these measures could bring in additional budget 619.3 billion rubles. </seg>
<seg id="487"> A trip through the mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care </seg>
<seg id="488"> Dr. Georges Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bvelle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="490"> In this West African country, doctors are not so much — just one in 5000 people </seg>
<seg id="491"> Vote here or via your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="492"> Dr. George Bvelle, one of the 10 main characters CNN 2013 year. </seg>
<seg id="493"> You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters, so that it became the hero of the year by CNN. </seg>
<seg id="494"> This person will receive $ 250,000 to continue his outstanding work. </seg>
<seg id="495"> For 21 years, Georges Bvelle saw as his father came back to life again, he fell into unconsciousness, wandering on to hospitals that were not equipped properly to help him. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Džamef Bvelle is injured in a car crash in 1981, near Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="497"> At first it was only a broken arm, but the infection has spread to the brain and caused a hematoma, which was reminiscent of himself until the end of his life. </seg>
<seg id="498"> &quot;No neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="499"> If we had money, we would have taken him from Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead, over the years, accompanied his father Bvelle in crowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment they can get. </seg>
<seg id="501"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="502"> — You can get away from home to 5 am, run back to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Patients very much. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The situation has not changed much since his father Bvelle died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor per 5000 people. </seg>
<seg id="507"> In comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if the Cameroonians to see a doctor, for many of them it would be too expensive. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care costs in it are private. </seg>
<seg id="510"> &quot;Their only problem is poverty,&quot; said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="511"> And because of the poverty they may not enjoy their lives. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bvelle became determined to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Last year, Dr. George Bvelle and his team of volunteers have spent 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="514"> He became a physician and surgeon in vascular works Central Hospital of Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="515"> He also founded ASCOVIME, a non-profit organization which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="516"> In 2008, he and his group of volunteers provided assistance to almost 32000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people jam into the vans, strapped to the roofs of medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit needy villages. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Not always be lucky. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Time and again they had to push the car across the river and mud. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: a celebration with singing and dancing and the best facilities that may offer local residents. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bvelle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join in the fun. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The next morning, the crew begins to take hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> &quot;We have 500 people each trip,&quot; said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They come from the neighborhood within a radius of 60 km from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, parasites, diabetes and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others may get crutches donated glasses or free birth certificates, documents required for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evening, the team conducts a simple operation under local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> The operation is usually held in the school, municipality or in the House; After the procedure, patients are and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Using a generator to light the operating and sanitary processing equipment, Bvelle and its volunteers work until early Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="531"> It&apos;s backbreaking pace, but the sense of Brigade usually help maintain village musicians. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;They all night and beat drums to be awake, and continued to work,&quot; said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of its work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> This group, consisting of the Cameroonian foreign doctors and medical students, carried out 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their support could be crucial to those they are helping. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One man explained that he received free surgery for hernia treatment will enable him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;It&apos;s going to change the future for me and my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a Hospital surgeon Bvelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="538"> It is this second job, he said, provides 60% of funding his nonprofit organization; the rest are covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;I don&apos;t even know when he&apos;s sleeping,&quot; said Katie O&apos;malley, second-year medical student Dreksel′skogo University in Philadelphia, a volunteer group Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="540"> It is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the Organization, to continue the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="541"> For future doctors and nurses such as O&apos;malley, coming from the United States and Europe, to join the Bvelle in implementing its tasks, this is an opportunity to practice that they never would have received at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> &quot;We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep the tools for Dr. Bvelle,&quot; said O&apos;malley. </seg>
<seg id="543"> As a student-vtorokursnikom, you would have never got that opportunity in America. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving from offering medicines. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But on arrival in Yaoundé from their meals, transport and education pays Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> &quot;He is a hero, no doubt,&quot; said O&apos;malley. </seg>
<seg id="547"> He paid his life for this organization, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For Bvelle almost constant load of work is not an ordeal. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Help to live a happy life, this his father promise is what brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy when doing this job,&quot; said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="551"> And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope he sees what I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I&apos;m doing it so people laughed to relieve their pain. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Go to ASCOVIME and see how you can help. </seg>

<seg id="559"> All in all, the United States blacklisted 22 people involved in &quot;Brotherly circle&quot;, and six affiliated organizations. </seg>
<seg id="560"> However, many experts have expressed doubt that such an organization exists. </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;Statement of &apos; the sister circle &apos; is more like an attempt to unite the scattered criminal groups,&quot; previously said an expert on organized crime and New York University Professor Mark Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="562"> In his view, the &quot;Fraternal&quot; reflected the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I haven&apos;t met anybody in the Russian law-enforcement bodies or elsewhere, who confirmed the existence of the criminal organization,&quot; Galeotti, American Center for the study of corruption and organized crime. </seg>

<seg id="606"> It can be argued that the collected articles about prose and journalism Senchina, reviews of his book and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature since the late 1990 &apos;s to early 2010 &apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="607"> In discussions about the works of &quot;one of the most controversial contemporary writers&quot;, according to critic Sergei Čuprinina, for the most part, is that the participants understand by the word &quot;literature&quot; how they see the present and the future not only of our literature and life. </seg>

<seg id="611"> Ex-employee of the American secret services Edward Snowden is not likely to travel outside Russia to testify in cases of wiretapping telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="612"> As told to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, American can answer the questions raised by the representatives of the General Prosecutor&apos;s Office of Germany, in writing or in person in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Check out Edward Snoudena outside Russia is practically excluded. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;In this case it will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington United States allies,&quot; the spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="615"> &quot;However, in principle, the GERMAN Prosecutor&apos;s Office in Russia might send their representatives or send written questions to Snoudenu,&quot; said the source, adding that the issue should be worked out at the inter-State level. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Previously member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Štrebele said that Edward Snowden was prepared to give evidence in the case of the American secret services talks German Chancellor. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Snowden was prepared to give evidence to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knows a great deal. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Despite the fact that the United States has blocked all the NSA&apos;S movement, Snowden was prepared to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="620"> But for this purpose it is necessary to clearly define all terms and conditions of his arrival, &quot;said Štrebele TV channel Euronews. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Lawyer Anatoly Kucherena Snoudena, commenting on the statement of source of Interfax, stated that his client would cooperate with German investigators, but when and how-will solve itself. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Citizen of United States Edward Snowden, who worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong S.A.R. in may 2013, after which revealed information about undercover operations special services the United States surveillance on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Snowden was flying via Moscow transit, but was unable to leave the airport because the United States authorities revoked his passport, claiming him serious charges in absentia, and prior to August remained in the transit zone of the airport &quot;Sheremetyevo&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The first of August Snowden received a document for temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo Airport. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Anatoly Kucherena American lawyer yesterday said his client took a job at a major Russian company &quot;. </seg>

<seg id="640"> Saying that many myths would prove to be &quot;too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools, Crossley-Holland stands for&quot; careful selection &quot;of age-appropriate texts. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I think it&apos;s wonderful that America&apos;s myths and folklore are already part of education,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I advocated the introduction of a training programme for twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="643"> He added that &quot;the excessive moralizing&quot; authors and teachers gets interest &quot;in children, and main ideas&quot; sublimated &quot;into fascinating stories. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf in the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote a collection of Norwegian myths &quot;to publishers Penguin and British folk tales», said: «you can of course be the intention, but you better keep them to yourself. </seg>

<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs has warned about the risks for the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of the fragile economic growth in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="651"> It is above all the crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass redundancy of employees. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> In recent times it is completely driven by consumption, which is almost the highest speed, &quot;said the Chief Economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Under Clemens, representing today the quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now the nominal wage growth in Russia-approximately 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> With inflation at 6 percent, he will be able to provide future consumer demand around at the current level, at Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But Russian companies &apos; profitability falls, so most likely they would undertake optimized personnel costs. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: If wages grow at 10%, the GDP by only 2%, explained Mr. Box. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The company faced a decline in ROI. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If it doesn&apos;t grow, it could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Do not raise the salaries of Russian business can&apos;t, commented Barclays Capital&apos;s Chief Economist for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantûšin. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment is near historical lows, competition for workers is high. </seg>
<seg id="662"> To lure staff from or keep current, employers have to raise salaries. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia supported by the land-owning elite and very rapid growth in consumer lending. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to the graph, because of the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country, this type of lending is not. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;The benefit to the economy from rising consumer lending we have seen no money does not diverge on the economy, and are returning to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; said the Economist. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But the problem lies elsewhere-at Goldman Sachs expect growth delay on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="667"> They are mostly poor people who have nothing to offer as security. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Interest on such loans are high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, they often do not return, &quot;said Mr. Box. </seg>
<seg id="670"> So the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Director of the Institute of ECONOMICS Banking Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of a looming banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit institutions, not having access to low-cost resources, which have state-owned banks were forced to raise funds of high-interest. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response, State banks went on the warpath and began lowering interest rates, the Economist continued. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit institutions may not grant loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative margin percentage. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If the banks do not desist from dumping, Russia may face a full-fledged banking crisis, said Vasily Solodkov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Disbarment of some banks in recent weeks, the Economist believes the harbinger of mass collapse. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;The State banks not cope with such a situation: deposit insurance system originally was not designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; warned the head of the Institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But increases in consumption slows and the crisis of non-payments, believed to be in the investbanke, due to the non-indexation of salaries of civil servants and the military, embedded in the current version of the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partial impact on consumption would be reduced by freezing tariffs of natural monopolies (and, consequently, the reduction of inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partially: If the investment does not grow (a prerequisite to that yet-see Help), consumption growth will still slow, sure Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantûšin from Barclays Capital sees no conditions for the worst case scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk is the continued drop in oil prices,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="683"> According to him, Russia&apos;s economy will shrink if oil prices below $ 90/bbl. </seg>
<seg id="684"> At Goldman Sachs also noted that the CENTRAL BANK has not cut interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Paradoxical painting: inflation has fallen, and banks are raising rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank has advertised the transition to inflation targeting, &quot;said Clemens graph. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The Central Bank&apos;s interest rate policy is not affected by the market rates, affects only the interbank lending rates. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;For the CENTRAL BANK&apos;s collapse all hopes,&quot; praised Clemens graph. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Money earned at auctions of SECURITIES, banks use not for lending to the economy, and to manage their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> As soon as the reduced rate, immediately change the exchange rate, it means, that means trying to get away from speculation against the ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;Sooner or later the CENTRAL BANK understands that this strategy does not work,&quot; said Mr Graph and recalled that let the rouble in &quot;free floating&quot; State plans by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But you will have to either do it before, either to raise the key rate of the CENTRAL BANK (5.5%), he said. </seg>
<seg id="693"> In his assessment, the ruble now artificially overvalued by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Only one road-ruble weakening, the expert concluded. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if the CENTRAL BANK zaronit in finansistah at least a shadow of doubt that the Elimination of foreign exchange corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it may bring down the dollar much stronger. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snowden has agreed to give evidence of Merkel </seg>
<seg id="697"> Member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Štrebele, met in Moscow with Edward Snoudenom. </seg>
<seg id="698"> During the meeting, there was discussion whether Snowden to be interrogated as a witness in the case of GERMANY, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office on possible wiretapping of phone German Chancellor specslcužbami United States. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Snowden has expressed readiness to provide the necessary evidence. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> He made it clear, &quot;said Hans-Christian Štrebele-that knows very much. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And despite the fact that the national security agency headed by Keith Alexander has blocked all his movement, Snowden was prepared to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> However, you must first clearly define all terms and conditions of his arrival. . </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, US Lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding spyware United States. </seg>

<seg id="706"> FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not calls from a mobile phone) &quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but don&apos;t talk on cell phones, according to a long-awaited new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers should not expect immediate changes will occur. </seg>
<seg id="709"> How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, the FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Airlines will have to show the FÃO, as their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their textbooks for members of the flight crew and the rules for the installation of devices to meet the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The FAA stated that it had already received from certain airlines plans to increase the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;Depending on the State of the plan we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Currently, passengers are required to turn off its smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the aircraft door is closed. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10000 ft and Captain will not give the go-ahead. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers must turn off their equipment again when the aircraft is reduced for landing, and not include them until the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="717"> In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference could allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Most new airliners and other planes, modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Glejding, President of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;The new policy will be safely implemented (and we&apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option&quot;, said Glejding. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We frankly tired of feel the duty to school &quot;when it comes to this matter. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But the connection to the Internet to surf, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at altitudes of less than 10000 feet, the Agency reported. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="724"> So, still no &quot;Words with friends&quot;-intellectual Internet games, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your Smartphone in 2011, when there was the sensational case: the actor was removed from an American Airlines for refusing to turn the device off at the time when the aircraft was at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="725"> And heavier devices such as laptops, you&apos;ll still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment, since they could injure someone if it will fly around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Calls from a mobile phone in flight also will continue to be banned. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The regulatory authority for phone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The FAA might lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing </seg>
<seg id="729"> Last month, Mark Rozenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national expert on the safety of the transport of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risky. </seg>
<seg id="730"> &quot;Phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with the navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers, when the plane is in the air,&quot; said Rozenker. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Industry Advisory Committee, established by the FAA to study the issue, recommended last month that the Government allowed greater use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Pressure mounted in recent years on FAA to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Critics such as Democratic Senator from Missouri, Claire Makkaskil, argue that there is no compelling reasons for bans related to security. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The restrictions also becomes more difficult to achieve, because applying the devices became ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions turn off your device. </seg>
<seg id="736"> The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966, in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets. </seg>
<seg id="737"> New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Airlines offer passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Aircraft, modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The vast majority of ships adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said worth. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices generally emit radio signals much lower power than previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when the pages. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But the signals become stronger when the device downloaded or send data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those who sought to easing restrictions on use of electronic devices by passengers, was the company Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011, the company loaded up a airliner device for reading electronic books Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices of any risk. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of air passengers stated that he considers the interference from devices, real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Other members of the Committee said that there are only isolated reports of pilots, confirming what devices can cause interference to aircraft systems, and most of these are very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allowed pilots to require passengers to turn off the device during instrument landings under conditions of limited visibility. </seg>
<seg id="750"> A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO United States Tourist Association. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Vilnius suspects Moscow of attempting to defame the Lithuanian President </seg>
<seg id="753"> Russia intends to implement informational provocation against the dignitaries of Lithuania and the Eastern partnership countries-such a statement the agency BNS did in the Department of State Security Directorate (VSD). </seg>
<seg id="754"> This information is published on the portal DELFI. </seg>

<seg id="757"> The structure is headed by Eugene Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and took part in the Congress of the people&apos;s Party. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Also part of the operation is a member of the Department v. Smirnov. </seg>
<seg id="759"> According to the secret service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work of until the end of 2012, regularly travelled to Lithuania and was in contact with local politicians, political scientists and media representatives. </seg>

<seg id="769"> New antinikotinovaâ vaccine can prevent the process of smoking pleasure </seg>
<seg id="770"> Scientists have developed a antinikotinovuû vaccine, which could deprive the cigarette smoking pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="771"> One dose of vaccine to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further tests before the start of the trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal City from the Medical College of Cornell in New York said that the first results are encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We very much hope that such a strategy is the use of vaccines might finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, having tried all of the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern tools,&quot; said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="774"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information for the production of antinikotinovyh antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Virus selectively infects cells of the liver, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Antibodies are hunted down any molecules of nicotine in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker a nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="777"> The vaccinated mice, then gave nicotine to continue their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="778"> And mouse, which did not give the vaccine, &quot;relaxed&quot;, and it is a sign that nicotine was up to their brains, the researchers said. </seg>
<seg id="779"> These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Previous tobacco vaccine have failed because they contained the antibody. </seg>
<seg id="781"> To maintain a high level of antibodies, shots have to do so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it makes the cells of the liver in the factory of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the urge to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking. </seg>
<seg id="785"> &quot;They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get the pleasure of nicotine vaccine, and this may help them to get rid of this habit,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="786"> British scientists said that the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed. </seg>

<seg id="791"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for what they carry hand baggage on board your flight. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for carry-on luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda, although their ad on Wednesday that passengers will be able to leave the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="793"> The new fee for carry-on luggage apply to bags in the overhead luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat remain free. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Frontier said it will charge $ 25, if the fee is paid in advance, and $ 100 if the travelling will be paid only once at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&apos;malley said that charge $ 100 to get passengers to take care about paying in advance. </seg>
<seg id="796"> &quot;We do not want to charge you for it,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Airlines have begun to charge a fee for the first and second bag, being turned into baggage, in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Passengers trying to avoid these fees, fill as many as can, in your carry-on luggage, placed in the upper baggage compartments, which in these compartments are often not enough space. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Taxes is one way to get passengers to take less on board. </seg>
<seg id="800"> O&apos;Malley said that this new collection is really not for the sake of making money. </seg>
<seg id="801"> The fact of the matter is that the most loyal customers Frontier state that find a place in the upper baggage compartment becomes harder. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Passengers who bought tickets on the website of the airline, will not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="803"> This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag for free, while a passenger in a queue can pay $ 100 for the same bag. </seg>

<seg id="807"> They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many on Wall Street believe adding luggage fees a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> However, most of them not related to fees for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first fee for carry-on luggage, three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with such a Hungarian Wizz Air airline consultant, said Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors supplemental fees. </seg>
<seg id="812"> In his assessment report of December 2011, fee for carry-on luggage brings Spirit $ 50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the flight of Spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where the passengers would face with an unusual collection of Spirit for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> &quot;The landing was the most smooth of the ones that I&apos;ve seen in my career in airlines, he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and fights at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, &quot;he said,&quot; and the landing took place rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Frontier also follows the Spirit of the $ 2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier said that passengers who get soda or juice may leave the Bank and refill the coffee will be provided free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It will still be free to hand out water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in the 2008 year, but abandoned this after seven months, when the passengers began to complain and no other major airline has not followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Frontier initiative on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers buy tickets directly from the airline, is the latest measure to attract customers to your Web site. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airlines pay online-ticket sellers such as Orbitz, from $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, and does not apply to the online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> However, the Frontier has gone further in this area. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September, she began giving two times less frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday she srezala premium number of miles to 25 percent of the miles traveled. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, a trip to 1000 miles from the Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would get 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> In addition, passengers can choose in advance only if they buy the tickets directly at the site of the Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="829"> The Frontier has a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business contracts and becomes unprofitable. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Revenues fell by 9 per cent, and flight capacity declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic tries to fix the finances of the Frontier as part of the sale of the airline. </seg>

<seg id="833"> And now, news from across the ocean, namely Syria, where, as we know today, Israel attacked the Russian-made missiles, which reportedly were aimed at Hezbollah. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Today, Syria has fulfilled the essential condition-1 November to destroy their chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="835"> This was done within the framework of the agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and the United States are not allowed to conduct military operations to which they have come close this summer. </seg>

<seg id="837"> Washington said that the Assad regime will be punished for it. </seg>
<seg id="838"> More than 1400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas. </seg>
<seg id="839"> And the punishment has come. </seg>
<seg id="840"> But not in the form of u.s. bombing, and in the form of a transaction that a friend of Assad-President Vladimir Putin. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Syria abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year. </seg>
<seg id="842"> And today is an important milestone. </seg>
<seg id="843"> A team of international experts reported that Syria has withdrawn from the alleged chemical weapons factory. </seg>
<seg id="844"> The longer-term task is heavy and the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components. </seg>
<seg id="845"> We understand that this is about a thousand tons. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Earlier, Washington said that Assad&apos;s days are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="847"> I believe Assad has to go. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="849"> It is no longer legitimate and must go. </seg>
<seg id="850"> But Assad remains. </seg>
<seg id="851"> And feels more confident. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Its troops continue to use artillery, rockets, and napalm. </seg>
<seg id="853"> His opponents divided and poorly armed. </seg>
<seg id="854"> His people were forced to flee their homes, many starving. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Some have to eat leaves and cats. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Many believe that Bashar Al-Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The chemical weapons agreement called the success of diplomacy, inspectors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Asad himself was impressed by a person ready to cooperate. </seg>
<seg id="858"> In Washington today, the Ambassador of United States in Syria had to answer tough questions. </seg>
<seg id="859"> When a child dies of hunger, his mother is hardly easier from the fact that it was not killed by chemical weapons. </seg>

<seg id="863"> Leninsky City District Court sentenced him to 240 hours of required works residents, who posted a video on the social network of extremist orientation, reported RIA Novosti News Agency on Friday, the spokesman of the regional court. </seg>
<seg id="864"> According to the Court, in March 2013, the man put on his page on the popular social network video recording, which added to the federal list of extremist materials. </seg>
<seg id="865"> He was prosecuted under the CRIMINAL CODE of the RUSSIAN FEDERATION &quot;acts intended to incite hatred and enmity, and the humiliation of the dignity of the human person committed publicly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="866"> &quot;Lenin District Court heard the case in a specific order and found the man guilty of the above offence, punishment in the form of 240 hours of compulsory labour,&quot; said the Agency&apos;s interlocutor. </seg>
<seg id="867"> She added that the man has pleaded guilty. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate gender&quot; </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender in children born with external sexual organs of intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="870"> The newborn will no longer be required to attribute the male or female gender. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law does not require parents to call a floor, allowing parents to specify gender as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; in their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The purpose of the Act was to remove pressure from the parents, who may take hasty decisions on operations for assigned sex, and oppose discrimination intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One interseksual′nyj people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I&apos;m not a man and not a woman. </seg>
<seg id="874"> I&apos;ll stay created by patchy product with bruises and scars. </seg>
<seg id="875"> About one in 2,000 children born each year, is neither a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="876"> They and one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sex development &quot;is a collective term for people with abnormal chromosomes, gonadami (ovaries or semennikami) or unusually developed outer sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Wallis Simpson was probably interseksualom. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identification is still poorly understood, most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it, than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before performing the operation, if it happens. </seg>
<seg id="879"> A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identity, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Interseksual′nye kids create ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most children do not have them,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how evolving identity. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science of how a child will develop a gender identity that is not too accurate. </seg>
<seg id="884"> No one can answer questions about why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It&apos;s like a mystery about why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes the intersex people as distinguished from transsexual or transgender, as their status is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively a male or female and typical for both at the same time or not typical for any of them. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These characteristics may occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, distribution of hair, breasts and physique; primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by interseksual′nye and transgender people in employment, as well as on the level of harassment, brutality and crimes motivated by prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Boys with gender problems now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal have allowed adults to male, female, or &quot;third gender&quot; in its official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, the 52-year-old Australian resident Norrie may-Welby became the first man in the world, recognized the &quot;genderless&quot;, defended in court the right to maintain &quot;an unspecified&quot; sexual status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the Ministry of the Interior, in German passports will be the third designation in addition to M and F-X, that is, interseksual′nyj. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In neighbouring France, gender issues still cause controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this marked the Catholic countries, have signed a petition of &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> American Web site Catholic Online also expressed his disagreement with German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is drawn to a new State where sex is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we turn the two pillars of civilization. </seg>
<seg id="896"> One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also said the Web site Baby Zone, that she would prefer that children have sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Hard enough to raise a child and without additional restrictions, especially if you don&apos;t know the sex of their child,&quot; she said the Web site for parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Children need stability and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs, called hermaphroditic — named the beautiful Greek God who possessed characteristics of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And even just ten years ago, the medical community reacted gender as a worksheet where you can all erase, and then again to draw. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many have challenged the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to take the floor when she grows up. </seg>
<seg id="902"> &quot;In the middle of the 20th century it was called&quot; urgent psychiatric case &quot;, said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When such children were born, you were not a psychiatrist — you call the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The dominant theory about how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and claimed that the environmental signals, including social-how parents raise their children, interact with genes and hormones of the child when determining whether a person is male or female. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one case, 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan&quot;, his theories have come under question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He advised parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during circumcision, negligent completely neutered the child by removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case, &quot;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When he was about 15 years old, he became again a boy and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But in the 38 years he had committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Drescher said that some doctors still use this model. </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990 &apos;s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of the sex-change operation, have declared themselves &quot;dissatisfied with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="913"> Such was the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but this intermediate type. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Doctors could not determine precisely whether a large clitoris or small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a full life &quot;men. </seg>
<seg id="915"> So shortly after its birth in 1976, external genitals and testes of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He began giving female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I knew that I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But being in a depression, and realizing that something is wrong, he requested medical documentation. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he learned was devastating. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born with impaired sexual development, which did not allow his body to produce sufficient testosterone for normal development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="924"> After learning the truth, he again became a man, getting injections of testosterone and removing their breasts. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The operation made him sterile. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring back to normal the perception of people with interseksual′nost′û. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Ann Tèmar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California-based legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, concerned that German law induces to navešivaniû labels and stigma. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="928"> Many activists are concerned that German law would encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give your child an indeterminate sex &quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are afraid that it will promote the intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we haven&apos;t seen how it will manifest itself, so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Tèmar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of a third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions regarding formal sex, she says. </seg>
<seg id="934"> German law requires its assignment at birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> This battle, in which young children should not at this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow up, they can make decisions about your own body. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist mammologist from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with sexual development and to help hundreds of other people in a support group, said that German law would support &quot;of both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Daughter of Abraham Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but it is a violation of sexual development, entitled &quot;complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Because of its androgen receptors do not work correctly, Kathy developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="940"> She has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, at 29 years old, Katie is married and runs a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy. </seg>
<seg id="943"> &quot;The law gives parents time to not to take hasty decisions themselves,&quot; said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="944"> He gives them the time to do some research and understand the situation, as well as the amount of time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="945"> In this case you order — grow the child like a child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a wonderful child, and you feel the joy. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We don&apos;t need to rush to do the operation, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;It allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel are right, she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> In the end, the child decides to floor him or her more comfortable — and that&apos;s great. </seg>
<seg id="950"> It gives children the opportunity to decide on their own. </seg>
<seg id="951"> State Secretary of the United States secret service: sometimes &quot;went too far&quot; in data collection </seg>
<seg id="952"> United States Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that data collection and 2nd American intelligence services sometimes &quot;went too far&quot;, however, the politician noted that appeared in the media information of 70 million people. </seg>
<seg id="953"> I assure you that innocent people in the process, were not injured, but an attempt to gather information. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Yes, in some cases, this setting too far and was illegal. </seg>

<seg id="956"> Experts of equestrian events, s″ezžaûŝiesâ in Cardiff, to fight for the Horse of the year award, knew that the competition will be very high. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Young. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Still, not even just a few months before making their first steps, this babe with her pet pony šetlandskim Toffee trotted raced through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adults rivals far behind. </seg>

<seg id="986"> On Thursday, the United States Court of appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed the execution of a court order requiring changes in stop-and-search &quot;of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case. </seg>
<seg id="987"> The second circuit United States Court of Appeals stated that the decisions of the judges Širy Scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city. </seg>

<seg id="1000"> Opponents argue that the changes will lower the morale of the police, not the crime rate will lead to an unnecessary waste of money and will not solve a global problem demanding conditions in police custody due to reducing the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade. </seg>

<seg id="1004"> He said this in the course of communication with readers of its page on Facebook &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> I can definitely say that the prices are determined by many factors, which include, among others, and customs charges. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the free trade area, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will suffer significantly. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> And this would mean that prices have to fall. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;It is with respect to the goods that come from the EU countries,&quot; wrote the Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> As regards the other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it is indirect. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> However, there should not be a price increase. </seg>

<seg id="1025"> However, he praised the Government for its response to his request for immediate assistance with which he first wrote to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> &quot;I hope that a package of federal aid will contribute significantly to the conclusion that the State health care system from critical condition,&quot; said Mr. Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the State Government, the additional sampling procedure substantially offset recent reductions. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s announcement is &quot;a decision similar to lejkoplastyrû. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the Labor Government of throwing up $ 430 million from the health care system,&quot; he told ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> When the State Government raises nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek guarantee that every dollar of the rescue package will not be spent on more bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Scream voter Obama </seg>
<seg id="1033"> I voted for President Obama, twice sharing the hope for change </seg>
<seg id="1034"> He said that Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to nullify the commendable efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Obstructionism cannot justify the problems with the Web site of the reformed health care system, Obama&apos;s drone attack </seg>
<seg id="1036"> A memoir of the 2008 Obama campaign, are a painful reminder of what might be </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Nathaniel p. Morris, a second-year student at Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I read terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I thought that this book will inspire me in times of discouragement in the second year of medical school and will renew in me a sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It&apos;s called &quot;the audacity to win&quot;, and it is a memoir of Barack Obama&apos;s 2008 presidential campaign year. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> The evening when I finish writing reports for my patients and lie down in bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and could capture the spirit of the speech. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Electoral victory was impressive, and the leading news programs did pause to reflect on this historical moment. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates were weeping with joy, and my parents were saving all of the newspapers that they could find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> The White House had come a young team strategists, and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> At the time of Obama&apos;s inauguration in 2008, his level of support was 82%. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Back in the present is a rude awakening, as pulling out of the dream. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> It&apos;s hard to remember the days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> In the years since I first dropped his ballot, change indeed occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> This was something I could not even imagine. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the enactment of the affordable care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, repeal of the rule &quot;don&apos;t ask, don&apos;t tell,&quot; the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism is blocking too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, a choice of public health and the closure of the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting her in front of colleagues and peers, I have run out explanations that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I reached a point of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> The obstructionism of the Republicans could not explain the permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drones strikes on innocent children in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> He could not explain the data collection about the private lives of Americans by the national security agency or prosecution of whistleblowers reveal the misdeeds of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> He could not explain the murder of u.s. citizen Anwar al-awlaki, without charge or trial, or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> He could not justify the conclusions of the report, which stated that ongoing White House effort to silence the MEDIA, are &quot;the most aggressive ... Since the Nixon administration. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And lately he cannot justify the fact that you cannot develop a simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on medical care available. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I don&apos;t know that I expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Whether was 18 years of age, I understand that it may run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It is obvious that the work of elective office is not a predictable action programme, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and such random events like the battle in Newtown. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> However, all of the examples above I see that they have largely been a choice of the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> And that is what worries me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney was a clear and tough alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to decide on their own policies or views. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, live up to the expectations that we have for such a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> However, when this week, Obama&apos;s rating dropped below 45%, to return in the year 2008 by the book became much more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It makes me yearn for the many promises that evaporated. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton dealt Obama a high-profile defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At a meeting to review the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain true to their purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> &quot;I want us to return to our appeal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> &quot;We have to remember who we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1074"> Five years on, Mr President, and I completely agree with you. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Opinions expressed in this commentary are solely the views of Natanièlû Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> In Egypt accept the oath of the first freely elected President </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of Office, but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of political struggle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsi promised &quot;new Egypt&quot;, when brought to the oath of Office, becoming the first freely elected President, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court President also became the first freely elected Islamist President in the Arab world and the fifth head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy in Egypt for about 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> He took the oath before 18 judges in black cloaks in the courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian Temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> &quot;We aspire to a better future, new Egypt and the second Republic,&quot; Morsi said during the ceremony, shown live on State television. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life is absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said 60-year-old morsi, an engineer with the American education of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was a proscribed organization, serving as a target for hard action of successive Governments. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police, when the motorcade arrived to Russia shortly after 11 a.m. local time. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the Court building to welcome the new President, and, in contrast to the presidential pomp of Mubarak, traffic was stopped for only a short time to skip his convoy on the normally busy road linking the city center with its southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Although the Mursi were ridiculed as the &quot;spare tire&quot; neharizmatičnoe &quot;Brothers&quot;, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since its victory and Friday&apos;s speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists but also to all those who want to bring to fruition the uprising 2011 year against authoritarian Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> &quot;Today Egypt is civil, national, constitutional and modern State,&quot; said morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, the judges in obšitom wood-panelled Hall, where he took the oath of Office. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to pronounce his inaugural speech. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> An official reception was provided him with an army Orchestra, to perform the national anthem, in which he stood on the stand &quot;at attention&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Attended military commander field marshal Hussein Tantawi. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> His arrival was greeted by the slogan &quot;army and people — one arm&quot;, chanted hundreds of people gathered in the main Lecture Hall of the University. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secularism, the University of Cairo in the 1970 &apos;s became the stronghold of the Islamist student groups. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Mursi took a symbolic oath of Office Friday in Tahrir square, where the revolt ends Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian rule last year, and promised to return the power of the President, which his title was stripped by the military Council that took the case of the ousted leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But by agreeing to take the official oath of Office before the Court, and not in front of the Parliament, as is usual, it is the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> It Occurred at Tahrir square was filled with theatrical populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> The school called for more focus on math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> School English literature courses will require that students study at least one play by Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> On the exam will also feature &quot;extracurricular texts&quot;, to encourage more extensive reading. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> Combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> From 2015 onwards, students will be required to pass a language exam, with the insistent recommendations of choice of English literature as a separate exam. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The Education Department should tomorrow to release new curricula for English and mathematics — the first subjects, subjected to a radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> He will make changes in the other majors the following year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Separately, the regulator OFQUAL exams will submit the revised structure for the high school exams, with the new system of ratings and less coursework. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Speaking of summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was &quot;broad consensus that we need to reform our system of examinations to return public confidence, insisting that school exams will be&quot; more complex, more ambitious and more stringent. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Studies show that English schools are giving less time math (116 hours per year, or three hours per week during the quarter) than in most countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> For comparison-the Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore are approximately 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> While the formal requirement to devote more time in the calendar math will not, Coalition sources said large-scale school-leaving examination in mathematics, combined with an increased factor of rankings likely will serve as an incentive for giving schools additional training on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> The curriculum more attention will be paid to the real-life challenges, including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football-the cause of discord? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma under the &quot;Open Platform&quot; politicians and experts have talked about how to maintain national peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals made and such: ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game are some scandals and discord. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The speaker of the Russian State Duma Chairman reminded about recent events in Birûleve and said that to reduce the &quot;degrees of tension in society&quot; policy and media should be correct in the statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is one of the TV shows threatened to encircle the Caucasus barbed wire, if there do not want to limit the birth rate. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All the speakers talked about measures to regulate migration in CIS countries and on measures to harmonize the relations between the peoples of Russia, that the attached discussion &apos; confusion. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birûleve-&quot;modeling conflict, which could have been predicted,&quot; but &quot;with these questions we have meet too many people and institutions&quot;, and seven childminding babe without eye. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time against migrants was Europe, according to obŝestvennika, failed, and we must find a way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Historian Linda placed great hope in the new unified history textbook. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> &quot;Still it is necessary to create a guide to the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, to schoolchildren in Tatarstan, knew that the people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennady Zyuganov has proposed to criminalise &quot;calling for the dismemberment of Russia:&quot; If the United States said on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, then you would be arrested and 20 years in prison! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to incite &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, in all he accused journalists who make patients and acute national problems on the public discussion: &quot;in the heat of the controversy knows what to say!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The leader of the &quot;United Russia&quot; Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised reporters to &quot;Charter&quot; and agree to keep conversations on this topic gently, and then the same commitment can take over and policy. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> We have about 30 laws governing migration, and the procedure in General, said Mr. Vasiliev. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> As an example, he cited a law that holds regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace within their territories. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Lyudmila Andričenko of delight over this law is not divided: there is no &quot;clear ideas about the adaptation of migrants on its mechanisms and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Therefore, actors will interpret differently the scope of these powers. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> In addition, the municipalities have no expertise required to deal with such complex issues, no tools and methodological recommendations, which they could use, the Center does not give ... </seg>
<seg id="1127"> The head of the Duma Committee for nationalities Gadžimet Safaraliev proposed the creation of a special agency with the formidable name of &quot;homeland security&quot; dealing with issues of national policy. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valery Tishkov, who in 90-th years headed a similar Office, subsequently removed, objected. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> At the federal level is enough to have a special person, &quot;Minister without portfolio&quot;, that could be, if that. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> &quot;We go over the edge, shells exploded nearby, it is very important to members of different ethnic groups and religions together to oppose provocations, and should get a decent support,&quot; said the representative of the ROC relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> No neutrality of the State with respect to dangerous ideologies, religious including be, in his opinion, should not. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Here Oleg Nilov led off the discussion in an unexpected direction: &quot;more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, another check for you, but their push did not in that way, the wrong way,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;Not that way&quot; is the development of football, &quot;The soccer player beat the crowds, the flags burned, the stones throw each other comrades. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe we need a football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Is there another sport-Rugby is called ... </seg>
<seg id="1136"> &quot;They will not be Equal in the world in the sport!&quot;-ardently talked spravoross. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Rugby in the Caucasus no play! -immediately intervened, Mr Zhirinovsky. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You&apos;re still curling them offer! </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Be aware of national features, this is like Georgian &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; offer &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands of the distinguished representatives of the Moscow Club-while playing for his local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Football will have to ban throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Recognition of the national security agency increased the paranoia of corporations with respect to the State of surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1143"> On a warm afternoon in late August, the German police helicopter flew low over the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> On the instructions of the Federal service for protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&apos;s internal intelligence service, his task was to take a picture of the roof of the building mission of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> German media say that the BfV was hoping to detect listening devices, antennas and those actions have led to negotiations between the United States and the German Foreign Office in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Clapper, the Director of national intelligence, United States, in September again pledged that the United States does not use foreign intelligence &quot;for theft of trade secrets by foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to boost their international competitiveness or to increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But since Edward Snowden was a contract employee, razoblačitelem, began publishing its trove of secret intelligence, United States, European Governments and business leaders no longer unsure of whether to trust the Director. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Reports that the national security agency United States followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has access to the data stored in cloud services United States suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the corporate paranoia caused by the surveillance state to new heights. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The last straw was the news that telephone was bugged by Chancellor Angela Merkel, perhaps about ten years. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If the most influential person in Europe may become a target, then, of course, are potential targets and business leaders. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snowden made it obvious the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> I think it is likely that these data are used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> &quot;Germany should wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grûn, President of Association BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> German companies are convinced that the United States now are almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July the consulting agency EY. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> All documents disclosed by Mr. Snoudenom, however, so far, there has been no evidence that the United States passed on trade secrets foreign companies with their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain features in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Businessmen skeptical of this. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in the German Parliament says that we must create the German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again ... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> &quot;This is not an option,&quot; said Plattner, President Gassot German company-business software provider SAP. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it was not worth allowing it to die more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> All are subsidized in Germany: from coal to automobiles and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> All but the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> However, the scope and the technical development of United States espionage agencies gained thanks to the revelations that the Snoudena were a shock to some companies that used to be thought that the biggest risk of surveillance is China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> A big shift taking place in the cloud, where the heads of European companies better understand that the data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> According to a study conducted by the Trade Association of the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-u.s. Parties have abandoned plans to use the facilities in the United States after the revelations about the American provider of cloud-based software for data mining Prism. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Jim Snejb, one of the Executive Directors of SAP, said: &quot;we see that consumers are asking a new question, which arose a year ago, namely: where are my data and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Many German executives contend that the final allegations-this is just a confirmation of what they already knew: the powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore, this information must be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> What is economic espionage, is not surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> He always had been. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> &quot;It was a subject of debate for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,&quot; says Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Officer of BASF chemical company. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> Americans spy on us commercial and industrial level, and we are also spies on them, because it&apos;s in our national interest to protect our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Corporate leaders generally don&apos;t like to brag about those responses that they have taken, as this may give an advantage to the enemy. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In large companies has long been understood that take the free USB flash drive at the show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least imprudent. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Directors of auto company Volkswagen, said that for many years the standard practice is to collect mobile phones before the meetings of the Board, so they could not be used as a listening device. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The Federal Office for the protection of the German Constitution encourages managers to consider the use of simple prepaid cell phones during a trip abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> Prepaid cell phones are released later. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> &quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,&quot; warns the report BfV. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> United States warn their own companies on economic espionage from other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> National Intelligence summary of the United States in February moved to France, along with Russia and Israel in the second number of offenders involved in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French have the worst of all. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Bernard Skarsini, the former head of the French Agency DCRI domestic intelligence, reportedly said in an interview this month: the services are well aware that all countries, even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, to spy on its allies. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated because of a fire in one of the terminals. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> An unidentified man opened fire in the third Terminal at 9.30 am local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 GMT). </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Protection of staff and passengers evacuated the second and third Terminal. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> According to preliminary data, the man led high power rifle shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Several people, including a member of the United States transportation security administration, were injured. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Police opened fire and arrested the attacker. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> He slightly injured. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Tripodi denies that influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="1193"> Former New South Wales labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be involved in the investigation, anti-corruption oversight body of that State. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denies making changes to the lease coastal sites at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, secretly owned shares in three properties on public land. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The independent Commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation of whether lobbied Mr. Obeid from several Ministers of the renewal of leases on Serk′ûlar, where the Obejdov family owns two restaurants and a café, without going to tender after they expire in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of secret involvement of Mr. Obeid in real property, after testimony by the former Deputy Head of administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Èšpoul on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Within a few years of discussions, which started in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent was exhibited at an open call. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Tenants were against it, and wanted a more long term lease. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> In 2009 year leases of enterprises to Serk′ûlar Ki Obejdov family, which brought about $ 2.5 million a year, were extended without putting on an open competition. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of infrastructure and transport in February 2006 to November 2009, originally stood for open competitions. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who recognized Mr. Tripodi, strongly advised to make changes in government policy. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> The ICAC decoding telephone conversations are conversations in August and September 2007, between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve This, senior officer, Ministry of ports that came in after work, under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Department of fisheries. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> &quot;Whether the issue discussed during these telephone conversations, the issue of development policy a commercial lease?&quot; asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley Mr. Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> &quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Tripodi. — </seg>
<seg id="1205"> I can&apos;t recall what was discussed, but it was definitely not that. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> UN announces new targets to overcome poverty </seg>
<seg id="1208"> The United Nations should immediately begin work on a new set of targets for the replacement of the Millennium development goals which were set 12 years ago for overcoming poverty in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the goals of sustainable development the MDGS due to expire in 2015, before the UN Summit on sustainable development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the previous evening. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the Summit. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the night before the Summit that &quot;now is the time to rise above national interests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1212"> &quot;I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to start and take control of the process of creating a universal goals of sustainable development-LRC,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1645"> Scientists have found that family members had disrupted the gene Foxp2, but how it performs its function remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> In the new study, biologists have shown that at least some of their functions of Foxp2 does as a stimulant of the formation of new synapses in a brain region associated with the formation of the speech. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> He does this by another gene, SRPX2. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The last was found in a search of factors that stimulate the formation of synapses. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes, the authors found, with only his activity viâet Foxp2. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> What really affects the SRPX2 vokalizaciû, scientists have confirmed in an experiment at myšatah. </seg>

<seg id="1674"> Protein that we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> So when your mouth is warm protein, this will increase the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow. </seg>

<seg id="1884"> Published on Wednesday, data showed that the jobless now 12.5% of the population. </seg>

<seg id="1893"> Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, recognized the Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This first stage of disarmament Damascus completed the day before the deadline. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Up to 1 November, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary installations designed for the production of chemical warfare agents, reports the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> The destruction of stocks of chemical warfare agents or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> According to the OPCW, the poisons are in sealed vaults. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> International inspectors went to Syria after being on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 in the chemical attack died, according to the United States, more than 1400 people. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> The main task of the inspectors, it was not time to lose-so as not to let the Syrian authorities to make more chemical weapons and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munition. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> These manufacturing facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their fixes. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Next milestone-mid November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> There are a lot of issues. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where they will be destroyed? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will provide the equipment? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All Syrian statements will be scrutinized by Western intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They will readily recommend new sites to the inspectors to check if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully candid. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> United States believe that the attack was carried out by regular troops. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia have insisted that it is the work of Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership-in accordance with the agreement reached under the mediation of Russia, destroy or make inoperable the capability to produce bombs, poisonous gases and liquids and to fill the shells. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now that this stage is passed, the next step would be to destroy existing chemical weapons by the Syrian army. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is expected that the arsenal might be more than 1000 tons of toxic nerve agents, mustard gas blister and other illicit chemicals stored in several different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> For its destruction, OPCW and the Syrian authorities have agreed on a schedule to start action-this has biweekly. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Head of the OPCW field operations Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally oversaw the destruction of equipment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;They have no possibility to further manufacturing or mixing of chemical weapons,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In a statement, the OPCW said that inspectors visited 21 out of 23 sites in Syria and have seen that plants bombs and Poisons either destroyed or destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The remaining two objects too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, it says, but the equipment was transported from and retrieved by the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> According to Smith, the destruction of infrastructure for production of chemical weapons was a &quot;particularly difficult&quot; because the work had to be in a situation of continuing conflict. </seg>

<seg id="1919"> George Kerevan: gap with Europe gives Scotland a selection </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Another day, another to intimidate people: on independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> This time we have warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the Pan-European area of free movement, as a condition of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Preform stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s wall. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> However, the newspaper pointed to the Strathclyde possible economic benefits from more free movement to the rest of Europe, though — that is predictable does not appear in the headers. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> No one also not pointed out that EU countries spend a lot of time trying to rotate its formal rules as they are convenient. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Since Scotland is not included in the Schengen area, continued non-compliance will be a cheap concession to Brussels instead of what he really wanted from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So it&apos;s not a worthy story. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And so old, that it has turned into a fossil: the first time I heard &quot;Duck&quot; that &quot;independence is passport control, at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> And yet there is an interesting point, lost in the retelling of old tales. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why an independent Scotland should execute orders in Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why change the yoke of London Jarmo Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Here&apos;s the real news: the great European postwar plan to unite Europe finally stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With the evrokrizisom project &quot;Europe&quot; is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Throughout the European Union parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as the single currency gaining strength. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany, the party of evroskeptikov &quot;alternative for Germany is founded only this year — appeared out of nowhere and got nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thereby effectively cutting free Democrats (similar to our&quot; Liberal Democrats &quot;) of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Always there was internal opposition plan create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the fetters imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the project &quot;Europe&quot; has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The euro crisis a little due to the fact that national Governments operate at excessive budget deficits, this was true only for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Actually evrosistema has blocked its members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, is that German politicians are determined to preserve. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the South Europe turns out to be a disadvantage on production capabilities compared to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only thing saving tool is salary and cut back on government spending that is actively supported. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Current problems of budget and currency worth a deeper problem of productive abilities. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of a set of measures to &quot;green&quot; energy, embedded Brussels, is a cipher, which means subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, is a European industry pays twice as much electricity and is four times more for gas than in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> The paralizuûŝe adverse price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No freezing wages in the world will not stop the crushing victory of cheap shale gas United States over the European petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result of the riot is brewing, especially in France, once the most fervent supporter of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war the French political elite consider the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin no longer needs in Paris as in the receipt of political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy of Europe, leaving behind a devastated economy in distress. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> The result is right, the EU opposed marine Le Pen&apos;s Party &quot;national front&quot; had just won a critical by-election, dropping the ruling party the Socialists into third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The &quot;front&quot; is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning British laborers that you cannot assume that the split among right-wing automatically would be in favor of the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What does Le Pen with his newfound popularity among the French of the white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If — and it is very likely-minded party against the EU will receive support in these elections, such a block would be able to dominate for the first time in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The EU will not disappear, but it is something of a vague &quot;(sovereign) Nations, which like General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and several dependent economies can preserve the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I assume that the United Kingdom therefore dissociated itself from the project, hoping to get closer to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that the United Kingdom will remain out in the cold Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Where this leaves Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to become a region (in effect) a small England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can defend their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send to Berlin and Brussels to the dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland could succeed within a free European Agreement, provided that we will keep its currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in nefederal′noj Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The Scottish National Party in Scotland is — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, with an impressive majority in the 2011 year due to objections to proposed spending cuts (and implemented), the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darlingom and subsequently by the Tories and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Scotland it would be ludicrous to now vote for independence, only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2043"> Early puberty: aging before </seg>
<seg id="2044"> An African-American and Latina girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white contemporaries, studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Physical changes do not mean that puberty close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the triggers of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> The trend to early sexual maturity is not as pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Whether the mother scared if her daughter begin to form the rudiments of breast and pubic hair grow in 7 or 8 years old? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual Conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, children&apos;s endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitc explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and are the new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — typically does not mean fast full sexual maturity,&quot; said Kaplovitc. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But it was only a small shift in age at menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and decreased compared to 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;After the breast begins to develop, is at least two to three years before the menarche, said Kaplovitc, who is also author of the book&quot; early puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Discussion on what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered &quot;premature&quot;, where breast augmentation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the growth of up to 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process slows down or stops, the pediatrician can monitor carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> More rapid progression may be used as a basis for analyses by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent a further consequence: premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth into adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations on drug or hormone therapy are based on the child&apos;s age, level of development, growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplovitc careful with medications, but acknowledges that &quot;suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings, that they differed from contemporaries. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Another big problem is clear: parents just don&apos;t want to have their very young daughters were menstruating. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They are worried about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they will cope with questions of hygiene,&quot; said Kaplovitc. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman daughters which menstruation started in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there have been signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> She came home from school upset and frightened that it first among their friends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are many theories about the causes of early-publicized sexual maturation. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> However, there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> Boys like girls-puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplovitc claims that premise, which has the greatest weight, is the obesity epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, that relates the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country of African American and Latin American girls generally reach puberty earlier than their white contemporaries. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Around the world in early puberty, apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Still a mystery: while the boys have facial hair and pubic hair appear at younger ages, the trend towards early sexual maturation full not so expressed, as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other doctors participating in Conference, affirmed AAP complexity of the topic. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The appearance of pimples and pubic hair can be found even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> &quot;We have to be careful about how we define true puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a children&apos;s endocrinologist at children&apos;s Hospital Gorieb in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk with your child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;This could mean earlier than expected, the conversation,&quot; explained Kaplovitc. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you keep calm, your child usually will respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Girls blossom early, need confirmation that even when it occurs too early, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2447"> Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is rising is that ValueMax, where it holds its deal this week was the third by the pawnshop, registered on the stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Loan against jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S $ 1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga), and almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Typically, pawn shops in Singapore are an effective annual interest rate at 17%, just above the 15.4% offered at United Overseas Bank, the local lender with a branch in the same shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> But pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> That&apos;s why millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawn shops as families feel pressure because of the rising cost of living and rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap credit, were aggravated by the propensity of free monetary policy in developed economies, families with low and middle income countries are turning to pawnbrokers to compensate for the reduction in earnings as slowing the growth of their economies. </seg>

<seg id="2459"> Record high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the rush with which people put their personal belongings, because they use the opportunity to get the money for their family. </seg>

<seg id="2466"> The customers provide the items they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households, she says. </seg>

<seg id="2493"> Russian law enforcement officers knew nothing about grouping &quot;Fraternal&quot; circle-new news </seg>
<seg id="2494"> INTERFAX.RU writes with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> &quot;After the MEDIA reported the Ministry of Finance of the United States make Leps in checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate &apos; Fraternal circle &apos;, we viewed all database, but this group is not found,&quot; the spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> In his view, the distribution of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which claims to act abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> As wrote before &quot;or&quot; yesterday the Ministry of Finance of the United States published on its website a list of alleged members of a criminal group &quot;Fraternal circle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Among them was named Russian singer Grigoriy Leps. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> It appears in the list as &quot;Grisha&quot;, laid out the night before. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The popular Russian performer they are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The exact name of Grigory Lepsevridze, nickname, date and place of birth. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In addition to the Leps, there are five others. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former Soviet Union, whose nationality was not specified. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the United States are confident that Grigory LEPs, who lives on the island of Phuket was carrying money to thugs. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> This post is a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to the reality. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Moreover, recently bought a House really Leps in Phuket. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> The Office noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Recording in black lists of the American Ministry of finance entails the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with persons residing in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Assistant Leps Maya Serikova stated that no notification to the singer were reported: &quot;it is difficult to answer the question that whether it is Gregory, of which everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the United States.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2511"> Formally to him personally, there have been no notifications, although I do not know, whether they happen in such cases. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> &quot;And, of course, it&apos;s all on the one hand, funny and surprising and unexpected,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> According to her, in Phuket, Grigoriy LEPs does not live, but, according to the United States Treasury, the Thai Island House he really is. </seg>

<seg id="2515"> Black box you have in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> While American designers roads trying to find money to repair a scattering system, highway, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box, neatly presented on the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> These devices that keep track of every motorist proezžaemuû mile and transmitting this information to officials, are at the center of controversial attempts to modernize the outdated system of financing America&apos;s highways by planners in Washington and the State. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Usually a boring motorway planning arena suddenly sparked intense debate and alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government the right to use the small boxes to keep track of how many miles you&apos;ve travelled and even, perhaps, of where you pass them, and then use this information when writing tax bills. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The tea party movement in shock. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned about and raises a number of questions about privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And while Congress has so far failed to agree to continue or not, several States are not going to wait. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They ponder how over the next decade, you can go to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists have already taken on testing these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Is it really necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;This is not an issue on which we could be the right choice,&quot; said Hasan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of Southern California, which is preparing plans to start tracking State authorities, travelled in every California motorist, by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The technology is already there. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> This need is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government&apos;s Fund for the construction of highways financed by taxes that Americans pay at the gas station. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Cars drive more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, not increased already 20 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politicians do not want to raise the tax even one cent at high prices for gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;A tax on gasoline just can&apos;t save,&quot; said Lee Mannič, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In his State of recently installed 500 surveillance devices on cars for testing mileage payment system. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;This is the best alternative in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Zanudy call it the mileage custom Board. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Not surprisingly, this idea has attracted urban Liberals, because taxes would change the nature of the trips to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Planning authorities in California are looking at the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious targets set by the laws of the State to combat global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> However, Rep. Bill Shuster (r-PA), Chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he, too, sees this as the most viable long-term alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Supporters of free-market Reason Foundation is also delighted by the fact that will make the drivers pay for every mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;It&apos;s not just a tax that would go into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, Vice President of political affairs Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People just pay for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of transport of the United States, which in 2011, called for Congress to move toward a mileage payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> United States Senate approved last year a pilot project worth 90 million dollars, which would have involved approximately 10000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> However, leaders of the House of representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns of rural legislators, representing voters who in everyday life often had to travel many miles to get to work or to the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Several States and cities, however, go down that path alone. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The greatest enthusiasm evident in Oregon, where for the biggest experiment in the country shall be 5000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will soon be paying staff for the miles mileage instead of gasoline tax. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada the pilot project has been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York, he is seen. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Il try it on a limited basis involving the trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> And I-95 Coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 States of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), exploring how they can make these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept has not received universal acceptance. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where approximately 50 cars of volunteers have been recently equipped with these devices, drivers were worried that the Government could track every their step. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;Concern about the&quot; big brother &quot;and things like this is a big problem,&quot; said Khan Gave, head of strategy and performance management in the Department of transportation of the State of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> This was not what people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When the tests were going full speed, the American Civil Liberties Union Office in Nevada warned on its website: &quot;it is not difficult to turn this device into the devices fully tracking&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technology infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to store records of daily movements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada is one of the few States where are the difficult quest for low-cost technology that would have allowed State authorities to post the car travelled in miles, but no information about the place and the time. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you can do it, said Khan, society will feel more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Search for this technology have led some agency staff to a small young company in California called the True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Originally this company was not engaged in assisting in the collection of taxes in the State. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> She sought to enter the growing market of auto insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the devices, which they test, attract designers, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded using a modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more likely to do this if you do not track their speed and track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of the True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It was some big errors in some of the pilot programs in the State. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There are far less expensive and less intrusive ways of doing it. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with providing drivers with various options. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can choose the device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they might just give up, having decided instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, which are all residents of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places, hoping to sell the idea cautious public, causing the device to do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> New York transport officials sought to develop a nalogooblagaûŝee device that will also accept payment for parking meters, pay as &quot;Sparks&quot; insurance and collect data on the rate of pool in real-time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> &quot;Motorists will involve benefits that they offer,&quot; said urban design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers of transport systems, however, think about whether all the talk of mileage payment just a distracting factor. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In urban transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay area officials say Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the construction of Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, so they pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgery, when all you have to do is to take aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentšler, Director of the Commission on legislation and public relations. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> The Pope will announce the first Cardinals Francis in February </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Father Francis will place a new Cardinals in the Catholic Church for the first time in his life on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> The Cardinals are the higher clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they elect popes, so that Francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will be involved in selecting his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There are currently 201 Cardinal. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> However, after reaching the age of 80 a cardinal he can no longer take part in the election of the Pope is the prerogative of the 120 Cardinal electors. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman father Federico Lombardi said that prior to the ceremony, the Sun will be a collection of all the current Cardinals, known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> &quot;Dad Francis decided to inform his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with Cardinals from around the world,&quot; said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Jack Valero, of the &quot;Catholic vote&quot; said that by February, the number of Cardinal electors may decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> He said he usually dad calling as many Cardinals, as necessary, to bring the number of Cardinal electors to 120, as well as many Cardinals over age 80 years, how much he likes. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Consistory in next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the moment there is a bias in favour of Europe and particularly in favor of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope appointed Cardinals from other regions of the world in order to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> In South America live forty percent of Catholics, but they represented a negligible number of Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> It will also be the first selected the Cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals Francis — a group of eight Cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the Church. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> In the past, Dad decided independently. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;Now, Francis chose the eight Cardinals to help him,&quot; said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> He said that &quot;it is possible&quot; that Francis would turn to the Cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> But we have not been in this situation before-all this for us for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Valero said the Pope usually erected in the post of Cardinal bishops of large parishes, but Francis &apos; full of surprises — so we don&apos;t know whom he will name. </seg>

<seg id="2696"> According to political observer, The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of attempts by high-ranking officials of the electoral staff and the White House, the former White House Chief of staff, Bill Daley, to assess what effect the vote will have on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Possible replacement was secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Only six of the President&apos;s closest advisers — including Daly, the former head of the Obama campaign headquarters of Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluffa — knew that replacement is discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> The book &quot;Rates doubled asserts that Daley was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their&quot; close personal relationship &quot;, but ultimately rejected that step, when data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list is not a&quot; will improve significantly the chances of Obama. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2700"> In an interview with Martin Daly confirmed that the Administration really had considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;I am actively advocated the consideration of a variety of things, and this was one of them,&quot; said the Daily newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> You must remember that at the time the President was in terrible shape, so we thought: &quot;Oh my God, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Although Daley has described the study as &quot;the necessary checks,&quot; Martin told CNN&apos;S Anderson Cooper, representative of the campaign headquarters a lot invested in the study of whether this move will bring dividends on voting. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> «Campaign headquarters not to spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups, if they do not take something seriously, &quot;said Martin in the AK 360. </seg>

<seg id="2716"> Legislative bans forced the Russians to drink less beer </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Russian Brewers bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> According to their estimates, consumption of beer in the country next year will stay at the same level, and this is the best. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Although originally expected growth of business. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> After all, this year is shaping up for them failed: sales fell 7 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> All told, the head of one of the largest breweries in the country, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Scheps at the III annual Conference of Adam Smith Institute &quot;FMCG in Russia&quot;, which has just concluded in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> It discussed the State regulation of the market. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> From 2008 to 2012 years the Russian beer market has declined by 18 per cent, because in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in the production and sale of beer-drink with a little alcohol, told listeners Scheps. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> No country in the world has such a hard limit of the beer market, the unexpected introduction of more and more illogical bans, which are supposedly fighting alcohol abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> Brewer complained that many legislative bans to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, had special effects, however, are all the new initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> All the more painful by producers of beer injected this year slapped a ban on selling alcohol at kiosks. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We lost 35 million consumers,&quot; said Isaac Scheps. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> The next year the Brewers two predictions. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Optimistic-the one mentioned by Scheps: the sale of drink will remain at the same level. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Pessimistic-drop even at 2-3 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> To maintain their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from the varieties, designed for the mass market, in the &quot;premium&quot; class: beers will be less, but it will cost more. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Meanwhile, the radical implications of declining sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;According to my observation, the level of the disease alcoholism remains at about the same level, said physician-narcologist Abdullah. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> However, increased the proportion of patients who use surrogates of spirits, as well as those who are &quot;hooked&quot; on spirit-based tonics like &quot;Jaguar&quot;, whereas ten years ago dominated the &quot;pub&quot; alcoholism. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> What will the construction of TCU in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Every year city authorities promised to arrange more transport hubs (TPU). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Until 2020, to be introduced in build 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The project has, in fact, was our correspondent. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; Metro Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line began building the fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The inscription read, that is a transfer site transportation installation. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> It was all very strange, as the &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport stops and therefore you cannot change. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> To reach the nearest trolley stop on the garden ring, one must overcome some 130 meters, including ground moving through Karmanickij pereulok. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> We now have the &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost all finished. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Faded flower stall, dismantled the stand for newspapers, and asphalt pavement was replaced before the entrance. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> That&apos;s the whole hub. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Freight interchange sites are planar and capital, explains in the press-service of the Department of transportation. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Capital of TCU. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> A planar construction of car parks, suggest withdrawal of trade objects, preventing the movement of passengers, creating small structures and landscaping. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Actually, not even TPU Planar transport workers, and professional blagoustroiteli from the Department of master of the city of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Transport hub is not necessarily a complicated design, explains the Director of the Institute of transport economics and transport policy at the higher school of Economics Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes a roof over their heads and boards, automate break bells about arrival time. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Here, for example, yasenevo Metro have recently opened a completely full plane hub. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Let without canopies, but with &quot;sniffing&quot; parking and signage indicating when the bus. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in the race for the number of officials write in TPU whatever you don&apos;t really need. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> In 2011, the city had planned to build all in all 151 site, 59 of them with capital project. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now the plans are up to the year 2020 up to 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> One hundred and fifty of them promise to pass this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although the city has a program of development of TPU, not designated any qualitative criteria,-said Alexander Morozov, co-Chairman of the public association &quot;the city and transport&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplants in each of them often deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Criteria, the expert believes that there should be two: first-time reduction, secondly-convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all the possibility to change the mode of transport, under the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow in the regeneration of TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> A striking example of the underground &quot;VDNKH&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Before suburban buses with the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the ALL-RUSSIA EXHIBITION CENTRE. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now they stop was moved to the opposite side of the street-astronauts. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Further, much further from the monorail, but closer to homes. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The gift that the residents did not like the bus terminal under Windows and complained to all possible agencies. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With capital of TCU in Moscow somehow does not immediately need. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them began to build five years ago at Metro &quot;Planernaya&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The project was supposed to be a model. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And really is an example of how the hub, given to investors, turning into a hackneyed Emporium. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, there are platforms for buses, carport, to avoid going on the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> However, himkinskim No. 202 and no. trolley 203 in Moscow have not fundamentally TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> As others moved away from Metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> But trade more space left. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Only one clothing store, 32 and in general have almost everything from pet supplies to a car dealership. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well in fact, suddenly the bus passengers will need to buy a new car in the driveway? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> When are building major TPU, somehow always turns out shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of the car park decided to give away the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor of the TPU &quot;Planernaya&quot; marked on the floor of the parking spaces is brisk trade. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, nerusskaâ speech and the guards, viciously poglâdyvaûŝie to our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Hub finally turned into a bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The thing that used to have a Metro &quot;Planernaya&quot; was, but it was demolished. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> And in the Prefecture of merchants donated and allowed to that site has parking. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Anyway because of the high prices there are always empty. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place. a new Planar TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> This castling. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At Metro &quot;Kaluga&quot; distance approach from lobby Metro bus was 50 metres,-says Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After the construction of the shopping center, supposedly TPU, the distance was increased to 170 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> To board the bus, you must go through the entire Mall. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> After 10:0 pm, when it is closed to avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> However, construction on &quot;Planernaya&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; will soon be flowers. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> In mid-September, town-planning-land Commission City Council approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two or three underground storeys. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> The main Monster will rise from underground &quot;Tushino&quot;, there will be thousands of 418.7. meters square. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Representatives of the Directorate of the RUSSIAN RAILWAYS, railway stations are responsible for the construction of the subway, already have TPU told reporters: in the future-there will be shops, hotels and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> The officials insist that the multilevel parking Zai-MUT between one third and one half of the square. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Take for example the &quot;folk&quot; garages. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Say, a garage for 258 cars, which recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 sq.ft. meters. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> Means for parking for thousands of cars from 2.6 &quot;Petrovsko-Her&quot; will need about 80 thousand &quot;squares&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> It&apos;s less than a third of the huge things that you are going to build there. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Let one or two floors will go on all sorts of platforms for buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Remains at least 150 thousand square meters. feet of commercial real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> And this, for just a moment, almost two gum. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> If the capital of TCU at stations and stations built by railway workers, the remaining area will master builders were. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> They also promised that there will be a lot of &quot;functional purpose of objects,&quot; including hotels, offices and even gyms. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> By the way, in the Department of property of the city of Moscow, recently told reporters that developed a draft decree, according to which investors can apply for a plot for TCU officials directly. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Without any contests. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> Because, they say, that the transportation issues for the city is the priority. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> TPU is ideal, for example, &quot;Harvard&quot; in Boston or &quot;Spadajna&quot; in Toronto, said Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> There&apos;s trolleys and trams go underground to the subway and distance approach from the car to the tram is just 50 metres away, without going outside. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Around no ugly trade. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> But Moscow officials throws in the extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Either nothing will build or too otgrohaem 25 floors with offices and apartments. </seg>

<seg id="2864"> Bombardier Inc., a Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported Thursday a net profit of 15 per cent under the influence of reduced the number of orders and delivery of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail Division. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> Located in Montreal, the company Bombardier also has not published any data on flight tests of its new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information on whether implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of aircraft into commercial operation by next September. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> After the first flight of the prototype aircraft took place about a month and a half ago, he was still only three times, raising questions about whether stage of testing on schedule. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> The results fell short of expectations and led to the fall of shares by more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday its assessment from &quot;higher than market average&quot; to &quot;than market average because of the belief that the growth of shares is restricted in the next quarter or two. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> &quot;Although the decline in the supply of aircraft was in generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the profit figures of the Transport Department,&quot; said Doerksen in the stock market. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> We believe that Bombardier will have new orders to the CSeries as the flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> However, if in the coming months will not be announced new orders, we assume that the market will become more sceptical about the program. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where it is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> However, solid orders for the CSeries has so far not too much is 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify claims about fuel efficiency and potential profitability of the new liner. </seg>

<seg id="2878"> The Test model of the aircraft does not remain on Earth longer than expected, &quot;said Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that the aircraft were planned downtime ground testing, and software updates. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> All manufacturers plan to test in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> We decided to conduct the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> This will happen during the flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> The second of five test samples must take flight in the coming weeks and the rest would soon follow him, as reported by the company. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Still, analysts are skeptical about the announcement that the first client will be able to proceed with the CSeries aircraft operation through the 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bombardier said that it estimates the launch date and will provide an update in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> &quot;The slow pace of flight tests-although, apparently, and matches the internal graphics Bombardier-reinforces our view that commissioning would be moved to the first quarter of the year 2015,&quot; said Doerksen. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> Aerospace Division order backlog amounted to USD 32.9 billion at 30 September, not losing since December 31. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> &quot;In the aerospace field results correspond to our objectives, but a small number of orders and general market conditions have become an embarrassment factor,&quot; said Beaudoin. </seg>

<seg id="2978"> Ben Grinmen: tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: the New Yorker </seg>
<seg id="2979"> It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America almost a century ago: entertainer Frank Fay, who was master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the public in the conversational manner. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Innovation Fay eventually was picked up by other, more recently, the New York Comedy Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Created and sponsored by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of stand-up comedy Club Carolines, the Festival celebrates this year its tenth anniversary, with over sixty shows in small clubs and theaters. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;Most of these started at headliners of the Carolines, and then achieved more success, reaching the point where they are too famous to be in the Club,&quot; said Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> We have created this festival as a way to continue to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> This year&apos;s event includes performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Stand-up for Heroes &quot;is an annual musical-comedy benefit concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where there will be, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger waters, and Bill Cosby. </seg>

<seg id="2989"> And Kroll, and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Džeselnik, crafty, focused on racial topics Kamau Bell), is the result of a decentralized world of American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> One of the highlights of the Festival will be an interview with David Steinberg with Larry David. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful Director in television and film, as well as the unofficial historian of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> From 2005 to 2007 he was the host of the show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The meeting will be held in the Hall of the Town Hall in Midtown Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;This city is certainly a central element of the work of Larry,&quot; said Steinberg. </seg>
