<seg id="570"> The scientists and light on this subject between the antics and his mood in the tail of dogs that are concerned. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Previous research showed that happy dog right are more shake your tail (dog), while from the point of view of uneasy dog more shake your tail to the left. </seg>
<seg id="572"> But scientists now say the companion dog can identify the tail of this subtle distinction and can express their reaction on that. </seg>
<seg id="573"> This study the Journal Krnrt Baeyloji has been published in. </seg>
<seg id="574"> The professor from the University of Trento neuroscientist Georgia Welllrtigra said: &quot;this is all well know in humans that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in a different manner in which the excitement generated the positive or negative feelings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> Here we attempted to see it in other species. </seg>
<seg id="576"> He also said that like humans, dogs in the right part of the brain the antics of the left hand and was responsible for the opposite order, and played two different roles in the Golarrddhon feelings. </seg>
<seg id="577"> For this to learn more about how dogs by other dogs unilateral the tail on the reaction, the researchers tracked the films of the other dogs look on animals. </seg>
<seg id="578"> He measured the throbbing in the heart of pet dogs and the analysis of their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="579"> We would it not perhaps more time to understand why one side so that his tail sometimes on the other hand is shaken. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Prof Welllrtigra said: &quot;we have the dogs with the films presented for the deal with other issues in the realistic version or in the shadow -were in the picture, and we see the HuA of tail and tail can submit more left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="581"> When the animals a stolid dog the right side (seen from the point of view of dogs) shake their tail, they are completely freely. </seg>
<seg id="582"> But when he tailed to change direction on the left side (seen from the point of view of) the dog again, the beating of his heart increased and restless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="583"> According to Prof Welllrtigra they not think through the dog these antics were deliberately to communicate with each other. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Instead, they think that dogs that he has learned from his experience on what action should be worried about and what not. </seg>
<seg id="585"> He said: &quot;if you have many other dogs get time, and if they are to continue a shake on their tail, it is more related to the practice, and at the right part presents behavior, you do the same reaction on the basis of the experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="586"> Researchers say that the conclusion of the owners, animal trainers and doctors can provide better information about the feelings of animals. </seg>
<seg id="587"> School of the University of Bristol Wetrneri Va. Fzelo, the dog behavior specialist John Bbredshoh told the guest that this is not the first study to check it is important that dogs left or right for the part or not. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Last year an aggressive dog to see the team of the University of Lincoln found that when dogs are around his head, left side and are happy to see his head on the right dog. </seg>
<seg id="589"> In other research, he said: &quot;Italian Studies of the University of Victoria in Canada, when the robot left than the right tail the dog was ilae, but instead of being regurgitated the dog was more likely to close.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="590"> He said that this was because the difference in various studies in animals or robot dog films completely dog the dogs were not understood. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He explained that this is the way the study can help to the reaction of real dogs by dogs. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;While there is enough evidence from different mammals are found that the two parts of the brain used for different purposes, to receive more detailed information is still remaining and dog are no exception in this case,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, the is easily their behavior can be recorded, we think that this may not take more time to understand that he never on one side, sometimes on the other hand, why is his tail. </seg>
<seg id="594"> New research, it turns out that we all work with honesty and dedication during the morning. </seg>

<seg id="1401"> To direct the development of symptoms like the blades of the breasts, hair and physical smell of female and Kaonkh girls in the time before. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> But in the last four decades has been very little change in the age of the first monthly Rjodrrshn (religion). </seg>
<seg id="1403"> In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, 12X75 in the year 1970. </seg>

<seg id="1405"> The development of youth is the most accurate test time. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> What is the start of the youth, this debate is about, but when growth with breast growth before the age of 8 years is two called it &quot;adult&quot; hair. </seg>

<seg id="1414"> Kaplovitqj said, &quot;how they worry about the risk of pregnancy, or that he has come from hygiene.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1415"> One woman, whose daughter was in the 10 years the Oomre menstrual cycle started, remember, &quot;the shock.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1685"> Yet Dlreshr said that some doctors are trying to &quot;follow&quot; the same model. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the year 1990 started, the people who come in through these gender Shalya medical &quot;not happy&quot; with the result. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> This was the case with the 36-year-old author of Mkntana Jim Bruce Aksxwaee., who was born with male chromosomes, but her vagina was unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> The doctors clearly didn&apos;t understand that his penis was small, or the Bhgshef large, but they were sure that he was never in the form of man can live life &quot;not satisfied.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> So the external part of the year, some time after his birth in 1976, Bruce and his testicle Shalya uprooted by medical and Parvarish the kind of girl. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The woman Haormoan in her 12 years of age. </seg>

<seg id="1760"> So, then, a story. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> And that is trapped, he was frozen so long time. I first heard of &quot;freedom means&quot; think like passport control news about 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> However, this interesting point has been lost in interesting to the old story again. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> Why should independent Scotland from Europe than to the Bidiamg anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Why should be buying sales, especially for the yauk Bbrsels of London now? </seg>
<seg id="1765"> The real European news here: Europe organised to the great post-war planning finally stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> With the euro crisis, Europe has been officially dead project. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> Compliance with the Berlin and the tough rules imposed by the European Central Bank, the common currency to the national economy has been through the project because many people have to consider the obstacles that Europe went too far. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> The very role of the national governments of the excessive budget deficit in the euro crisis was not only true in the case of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> But the euro system has its members in favour of the German exporters currency-something that German politicians want to keep the exchange rate stable. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Without the possibility of domestic currency Avmoolyan, southern Europe gets himself in the position than the underlying loss of productivity in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> That is the only way to reduce public expenditure and wage has been encouraged by Berlin. </seg>

<seg id="1788"> My view is this: soon the confluence of the anti-EU and anti-intersection currency in Europe will kill the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The euro, will not end completely, but it will reach back in Europe &quot;like a form of retail&quot; (arena), which will have the support of General de Gaulle. </seg>

<seg id="1794"> We can choose to create from the area of Little England (as required). </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Or we can protect their own economic interests -including Berlin and Bbrsels to tell the right time for being different. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> I think that Scotland is loose in the European system can better work performance, provided that we keep its own currency. </seg>
