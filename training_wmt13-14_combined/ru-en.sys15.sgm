<seg id="1"> ﻿The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> The leaders of the Republicans justified policies need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Centre will read out the last a myth, arguing that cases of electoral fraud in the United States are less than the deaths from lightning stroke. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In addition, lawyers for republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative effect on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada American states responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is why most state governments since 2009 pass laws complicating registration, or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has new scope after the election in November 2010, which led to the Republicans of 675 new places in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result only in one 2011 it was adopted 180 bills restricting the vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New election laws require a voter to show photo identification and proof of American citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of will and take a vote of citizens having a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> To the 2006 elections any American party did not require voters to show photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state that introduced a similar requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice and other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years they initiated the bills requiring voters to show identification cards with the images in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens have no such universal ID card, as a health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Indeed, 11% of American citizens, that is 21 million people who have reached the age to vote, do not have photo identification, their staff issued by the government body. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds 100 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions disproportionally affect young people, minorities and people with low levels of income. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% voters from 18 to 29 lack the required photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But there is more to come. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters who believed to vote for the Democratic nominee in several states are not authorized to use the photo identification issued by their school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for republicans, to use the evidence produced by the clubs to vote. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Until 2004, any state did not require proof of American citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> A similar requirement was introduced in Arizona for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011 more than a dozen states had enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures, clearly aimed at limiting vote of Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, republican legislators initiated laws by abolishing the registration of voters on Election Day in eight states in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction didn&apos;t take place without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 election campaign to voter registration helped impose about 10 million people in the lists. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to the fall 17% levels of registering new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, republican legislators passed laws aimed at reducing the time for early voting in five other states. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So, in the general election of 2008 in Florida of 33% voters voting ahead of schedule, were the Americans, although the latter made only 13 percent of the total number of voters of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same happened to Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of voters, they made 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike white which, forming 76% of voters, among voting field-commissioned only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Some draft laws were vetoed by Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The most controversial law that was suspended for the intervention of the United States attorney general. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This allowed to limit the negative impacts partially. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states passed laws requiring the presentation of the photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules that took effect, of course, would make it more difficult suffrage on the 2012 election. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics on democrats condemn bias of laws adopted as if this is a clear focus on affecting the election results 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Brennan Center report of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws, the current to 171 270 votes necessary to electoral college to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative effect on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening prostate cancer: to pass a test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the test of the DOG gives sometimes wrong results, pseudo-negative and sometimes pseudo-positive that lead to useless medical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="55"> For men, and so reluctant to passing a medical examination from how to begin to doubt even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To pass a test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> A study in the United States, numerous cases of infection among groups investigated so it is difficult to interpret the findings and difficult to develop any clear recommendations were observed. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Other research, this time European, found a different death rate in those patients who received the screening, and those who did not miss it. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also showed, after 12 years of observation that the odds of generating a actually is 30-40% higher for those who did not pass the screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to pass a test since 50 years, or 40 if one of direct relatives had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Men of African-American descent are subject to an increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key thing is the right decision as soon as the cancer is found. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The cancer can be both aggressive, and slow. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer treatment, offering it options, without necessarily cancer of the prostate, which does not pose a threat to life in the long term, and choosing, in these cases, in favour of robust monitoring the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men at whom the cancer is found, will not get treatment as their cancer is not aggressively and does not pose a threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer them active surveillance and if the disease is progressing, we will start treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly we with precision specify the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive medical treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Thus, I would recommend to pass the test after all. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is important to cope with the doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International association of urology, Movember created a tool to assess all the pros and cons passing of the test for the DOG. </seg>
<seg id="72"> The document (while in English translation will be available soon) you can download at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, respect for a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all people beautiful ate and moved enough 30% of cancer cases are preventable. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one did not smoke, this figure would be at least to 50%&quot; - andrè Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian association of cancer said. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, an estimated 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Some types of cancer utterly inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is associated with 85% cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It did massive harm to human health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today in Quebec 1.5 million smokers are&quot; - andrè Beaulieu&apos;s spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="85"> The encouraging fact: 10 years after smoking to die the risk of cancer is declining half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to CT data, overweight and obesity and encourage the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> It increases the risk of developing breast cancer, thick and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular exercise during the life guards from colon cancer&quot;, added to the Association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Food </seg>
<seg id="91"> The association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> At the same number it increases the risk of developing cancer of the large intestine. </seg>
<seg id="93"> It is necessary to avoid the sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Meat maintained by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can damage cells of the body and lead to cancer development&quot;, explains for Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists were researching the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment it&apos;s impossible to call the results of these studies unambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E produced conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed lower risk of developing prostate cancer, the other was the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In assessing the impact on the development of cancer of vitamin D and there is no clarity. </seg>
<seg id="102"> But Mr. Bolyyo stresses that it is important to discuss the anxiety and family history with a doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Delivery of the analysis does not lead to cancer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs&apos; boson in detail </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer, the message that he may have been able to find the Higgs&apos; boson caused a big boom - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that the boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, no less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, it is the latest particle whose existence has predicted for the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, the &quot;least imperfect&quot; description of nature and behavior of matter, but that failed to find practical consideration before. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physicists is not yet sure that we are talking about the Higgs&apos; boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know, without any doubt that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it poses to Higgs&apos;s predicted by the Standard Model of the boson greatly resembles. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, it seems to confirm, although for the full confidence in some data doesn&apos;t get. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Let&apos;s imagine, however, that he is a matter of Higgs&apos; boson as likely to be wrong seem minimal, and we&apos;ll see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Is, in this world one law absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To circumvent the rule there is no way, don&apos;t even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But while the physics of elementary particles is quite strange world, it turns out that it too, there is one law of this nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paulie which posits that two particles can inhabit the same space in the same time if they stay in same &quot;a quantum state&quot; is &quot;state&quot; is, in general, in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Accordingly, physics shared particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find a respectable citizens called fermions who sensibly submit to Paulie&apos;s principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In other bosons, mean gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means fuss that they can be a very peaceful in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> According to the site (by the way, extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Laboratory of Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn into two groups: мезоны of which we are not going to say, and &quot;force particles&quot; by which the main force of nature extend that Higgs&apos; boson in some way concerns. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this record, it is for one regions banal boson: to photon, or &quot;light particle&quot; that is &quot;courier&quot; of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Indeed, when a piece by electrical charge is accelerated or changes direction, we &quot;breaks&quot; electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a stone thrown into the pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;violations&quot; the electromagnetic wave (light, or the infrared radiation, or the package, etc.) is born, and this wave is than other, as the photon - and therefore one of bosons of &quot;force carriers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> So it is with Higgs&apos; boson, the only difference that in order that the boson turned out, other field, Higgs&apos;s sex should be &quot;broken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="125"> But Higgs&apos;s sex are much, much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field; to improve it, there should be very, very high-energy as if it was a question of a frozen pond surface very big stone to shake. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why the huge particle accelerator, as what is exploited at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km is necessary! To achieve such huge force-matter. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with electromagnetic field is useful as well to the balance explanation between Higgs&apos; boson and weight. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all particles and not all material interact with an electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, interact, others are not: A sheet of paper, for example, he will never keep on the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> In the same way, not all particles interact with Higgs&apos;s field: what interact, have mass while others (as a photon, by the way) don&apos;t have that. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So, what &quot;can bring&quot; all of these studies, Ms. Plamondon asked? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science they are used for testing the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM) and it also allows physicists to explore the divergence between the results of monitoring and forecasts See. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Moreover, some of them fervently wish that this divergence has been found since the slightest gap could open the door for &quot;The New Physics&quot; and stop up a few holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The last, needless to say, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (oh! ) or for the dark matter that forms around 80 per cent of the Universe (very oh! ). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while at CERN such differences have not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Consequences </seg>
<seg id="137"> For the daily lives of average person is more difficult to predict the advantage of these studies, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Look: at the very early 60-ies pioneers of studies of the laser in laboratories Bell could not imagine that revolution will be caused by their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They expected their applications in science, but no more than that. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Indeed, too late physicist Willard Boyle who worked in Laboratories Bella where in 1960, a laser and who he developed the first permanent laser (previous was invented were pulse) in 1962, said that initially, the laser was seen as &quot;The laboratory gadget&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And in addition, the application can be for instruments accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Uilliard Boyle in the optical research in 1969, developed a small sensor of light. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it was not at all its original mission, is now serving as &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics of 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> It certainly does not imply that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care is the best way to die... &quot;debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> In the Commission for worthy death in Quebec the sensitive issue of the end of life was recently discussed. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must soon be resumed, and Bill prepares at this time. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this critical area much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Debt&quot; tried to look closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Eshche living alone in an apartment in Monterezhi. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer destroying it from within, granted him a reprieve for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years, I lived seven&quot;, he says, between life and death, lying in bed in a shelter of palliative care Victor-Gadbua in Grow white where he is the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But he always shock, it is impossible to be prepared for it&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does work: incredible weakness that does not allow to go independently to the toilet and even self to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at a table on which there is a delicious meal, he is given and agrees that it helped to accept food. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He is invigorated, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around them, bring it drugs, lead him in the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage over the regular death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My biggest desire that I cured of diarrhea, it is degrading&quot;, he admits. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found medicine for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;During their lifetime us teach that the man must urinate standing&quot;, Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in Victor-Gadbua shelter said. </seg>
<seg id="162"> To recovery from the child&apos;s condition for some unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Everything depends on the human capacity&quot; to accept decline, he said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to many people who are engaged in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of that decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who arrive in the palliative priut Victor-Gadbua, everything had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts make them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide more help called &quot;medical&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Ms. 89 years, are most afraid to die &quot;in the minds of asthma&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease allowed me to recognize the children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good guys&quot;, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I want nothing to life&quot;, she says before allowing to deliver a mask to facilitate breathing. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit to a son who came from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> In a shelter Victor-Gadbua via group of volunteers give body care and help from food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is also palliative care, which remains when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make the death of more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec one place is the share of each 11 700 residents in the institutions of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is not enough, given that sooner or later we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here life goes on in the best conditions that are possible, Dr. Christian Martel is one of the doctors refuge explains. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether comfort physical, emotional or mental. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we will agree to provide oral rinsings from brandy or Pepsi, looking that he would ask. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics we no longer force to control sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday existence. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought beer to Mr. h.-p., who died tonight. </seg>
<seg id="184"> In the morning his son drank the beer in the legs at the dead. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help relatives as patients&quot;, says Natalie Savart, director of care for patients. </seg>
<seg id="186"> In a shelter Victor-Gadbua any day is similar to past. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Near the 93-year-old old man who enjoyed the last meeting with a family in the court, and settled down on the pillows in a toast in his honor, the young man for 36 years, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovashiya everything tragically dies to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In the past six months from three to five beds, are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years&quot;, said Dr. Christian Martel anxiously says. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients admitted to shelter Victor-Gadbua, come from the house and 47% from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is believed that 77% Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to care that is given to alleviate the suffering of the patients who had entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as Shelter Victor-Gadbua and Society of palliative care at home of Big Montreal, specialize more or less only on care for cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This big gap in public health system of Quebec forces many doctors, specialists in palliative care to be afraid of the adoption of the law legitimizing the euthanasia and assistance in suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, the manifesto signed by stars in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfur mount and doctor Bernard Lyapuant and proving their disagreement with a similar initiative is circulating. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr Kristian Martel, health care system Quebec is inadequate to ensure the right to quality palliative care before the transition would be permitted for euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, &quot;she says,&quot; I saw the patient who spent 14 days in an office in terrible pain, and nobody has the necessary measures to facilitate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I am afraid that patients want to die because they don&apos;t get cariage. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists till the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes of survival elein Richard were minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said regrets that I give up the fight, she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me that my days are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="202"> All-powerful care is not </seg>
<seg id="203"> Doctor Martel believes that 90 percent of patients who ask about death, thank the medical staff, that they did not meet their request after the team of palliative care takes their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it should be noted that palliative care is not entirely omnipotent to combat pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the society of palliative care at home of Big Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a partial sedation in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or permanent. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is impossible to pretend to be more that we do not know about these suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> More and more often, patients who fail to relieve pain, will be able to have access to a partial sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="210"> But it is meant not necessarily &quot;I wish that I performed euthanasia&quot; it&apos;s understood &quot;I want it became easier for me&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The creation of this story was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Studies of health Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> The officials responsible for building roads, construction contractors, collectors of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia say day after day that they know about the huge &quot;system&quot; beset the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry&quot; that is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is interesting as this system is scattered after all means have been put to use, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and former police chief of Montreal&quot; jokes. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Thanks to him in 2011 scandal as a by-product of the investigation of the malfeasance connected with road construction contracts in Quebec on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest agreed very reluctant to burst. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Dyusheno&apos;s report&quot; established direct connection between the industry, secret financing political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the investigation began in 2010, he stressed, only the Ministry of Transportation would save billions of dollars on contracts&quot; if some tempered his instincts to take a share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Charbonneau&apos;s commission &quot;already displaced two mayors&quot; he adds, hoping that it will cost &quot;to open the schemas behind individuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Permanent divisions on the fight against corruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> A permanent division that was created in 2011 was connected to business to fight corruption, which includes the vast state of government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, members of the special unit &quot;Hammer&quot; who in 2009, forced &quot;waste cartel&quot; Montreal to stop inflating the value of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, a series of searches, and some municipal officials, such as Frank website and Richar Marcotte, the mayor of a small town had been made, the charges of fraud and corruption have been submitted. </seg>
<seg id="224"> In turn is Gilles Wayankur who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third biggest city in the Province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> I suspect many receiving bribes at the time of the state orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, formal accusation was brought to a few engineers of the Ministry of Communications of Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The last blew up a real bomb, saying the investigation at about &quot;system&quot; of securing government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For several years Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts in Montreal, to some intermediary related to the mafia, who in turn, money transfer of the party of the mayor Géralde Tramble &quot;United Montreal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000s Zambito squandered money to the right and left. He had handed over more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) the various parties of the province, mostly to the liberals who were then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also admitted that illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from Natalie Normando&apos;s Liberal party. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts where inflated value </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Suerprenan, a former construction engineer, described in detail it before the commission: Ten years, he received from construction firms of gifts, invitations to travel to tournaments in golf, in restaurants, and bribes in total for 736 thousand dollars in exchange for a sewer contracts, which cost is overstated by hockey teams. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials responsible for building roads, admitted he received on his paw, overestimating accounts by 30-40% through false additions. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then one organizer from the party of the mayor, Marten Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble that it is deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget nabivaya party ticket counter with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in deep crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Roulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, rang alarm bells. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of the district of Rivyer-de-Preri in the east of the island, it faces from 2010 to the sale of municipal site bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers at the height of construction boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money to campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She said that in the investigation that will eventually be started, she &quot;will pull on the balance, allowing us to understand the system operates, thrive with ants to stop the gangrene and determine guilty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="241"> She describes the process as &quot;painful, but positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but its own investigation team and the observer will be needed to Montreal to avoid return questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we are moved away homes. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Dyusheno notes that in his &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; but especially he is concerned about the role of &quot;elected officials, aware of this scheme&quot; but not involved in fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec hits 70%, he joked: &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 a donation to parties but said it will not change the situation: &quot;While we are not strictly limit election spending, in politics there will be dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete overhaul of the system of state contracts and financing of the parties: &quot;We cannot fall below; having safely crossed into the heart of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger base, with the best control and the rule of law &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story also casts a shadow over international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno encourages those who laughs or to look into their own yard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG for - not FC Barcelona.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season you in PSG for achieved unusual application. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by individual consciousness, but can - and a new dimension of PSG for. </seg>
<seg id="254"> There were great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them I grow every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technicians also put a lot of things. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me to raise the level of my game day. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I don&apos;t burn. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the beginning of the center of advance preparation in NIF in Klerfontena and before I came to Saint-Etienne I always went forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Thus, you benefit from competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> To supplement this summer not to play matches on a very high level a novelty. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> It leads to such a player as I am eager to be up to standard and to give his best effort. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti support my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is helped by the deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Anchelotti is a master of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Anchelotti inspires respect in all techniques. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the Premier League it&apos;s hard to beat and it is among the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a great experience, and he won many titles with high quality clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think it will bring new titles to Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had an encouraging conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I moved from a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that it has to me, also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think of the first part of the season of PSG for? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the First League Lyon took us a place of the leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we still on call. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main goal is the Champions League: we were effectively qualified in the one fifty-eighth final. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to pass as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything can be. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to say the word face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First we want to finish first in our group, before Porto to be able to accept the return match in one eighth final. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Whether there will be able to be a PSG for top European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has a budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become major European club, Paris needs to win titles and to consolidate positions in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it&apos;s not so. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially the PSG for have the means to make the project real. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Not to take the title in the First League how last season, will be a big mistake? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we really earnestly hope to catch this crown. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close to it. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Typically, 79 points being taken by the title of the champion. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think we&apos;ll be okay. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that the fight for the title was introduced by such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media wait too much from PSG for? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we are expected to much, given how much was invested and what players at us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully are ready. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we win homes 4-0 against Troyes and we still find what scarify, of course, it frustrates a bit. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We wonder what waited first of all of us human. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not FC Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We try to bring the game project. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team was formed over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We proved in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which already has two seasons fail to be held in one eighth final although they also spent a great money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the attached amounts, we show you on 15 points ahead to the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It would be disregard for our opponents and the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not on the ball last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; in this new PSG for. </seg>
<seg id="317"> It shows, the First League is how exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG for seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic&apos;s exploits. </seg>
<seg id="320"> And that if say that there is some &quot;Zlatanozavisimost&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="321"> It just means that Ibrahimovic is a very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came for this purpose and it proves a star of the First League. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he played, he had shown that he is a great player and a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He, too, respects people who surround it. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he did, it is only valid. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It encourages others to improve the game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Competing alongside Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, and motivates all to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How do you experienced Euro-2012 from French team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I earnestly wanted to take part in the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab a little playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw there a lot of things, and I left it stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I manage to play good elimination games. </seg>
<seg id="335"> That what I hoped for from the moment of my baptism at Blue. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now have to behave is exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think of the first months of Didier Decham at the head of Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They are productive. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well positioned in the selection panel to the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He is a strict coach, close with players and inspires on victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blan. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I wouldn&apos;t want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blan achieved his goal, he qualified us in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Decham will bring Blue into Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> A deserved draw (1-1) that has been pulled on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone fought for all. </seg>
<seg id="348"> To this shock in Spain, in my career there were no similar matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> To pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered deals between receiving parties with fees on their processing. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as there is often to these technologies, explicitly political vision: belief that the current monetary system consisting of bank monopoly, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, a fictional Satoshi Nakamoto (nickname) but at the same time is virtual currency (but converted to dollars, euros... ) and secure protocol of exchange as BitTorrent which allows file-swapping between members of the same level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> About 200,000 operations were already registered from 15,000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites take bitcoins for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Bitcoin course, having peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2 before coming back today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in his report on the virtual currency, published in October became interested in the system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It describes the bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as used to advance in the video game that are made in the game or who are possible to buy (and sometimes to exchange &quot;loans&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But foreign exchange transactions always controls and processes any central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In the Bitcoin all hosts are at the same time, the holders of the book, auditors, issuers of currency, pokupately and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How the network functions? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two people is going on between the two e-mail addresses, like email. </seg>
<seg id="365"> For each new payment you can choose a different address, thus providing anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A lot of information related to the deal is signed elektronno, using a system of encryption with a double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can also verify the authenticity of the deal. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to file content, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the deal, really exist in the public accounts book sent across the Web. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Key stage is registration of new deal in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It runs through the decision of the mathematical challenge sent to computers, decided that if the temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Rather, it is a phase of the mixture of the file, that is the transformation of a large file to the electronic signature short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take&quot; new deal and add it number before &quot;the mixture&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> As soon as this number is found other nodes easily test that is right. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Deal is thus nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any amendments will change the electronic signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If for the purpose of cheating the user quickly (in less than ten minutes) wants to pay twice a year and to the topic, the money, only one of the two deals would be confirmed by the network - and another would remain non-validated as they have different digital signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> A computer that has solved the problem, receives 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the award is regularly halved perhaps until the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in the address so is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one millionth that leaves a reserve... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The complexity of the task also increases with increases in computing capacity. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Network life has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Their webspots services Bitcoin, have been attacked and bitcoins were stolen from reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The used defect does not concern the protocol&quot;, Pierre Noiza who has recently launched Paymium - the company making payments by real money with Bitcoin network use says. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The European Central Bank also reported the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash also has this deficiency. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Major players like Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, like WordPress blogging platform, fix them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizmann&apos;s Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounts book and found that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not occur in turnover. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Huge sales&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged&quot;, Jon Holmkvist working in Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins in gold being happy. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noiza, another author of a grant for the country&apos;s currency, a firm believer in the potential of this technology as an operational network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in the real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it is using Bitcoin to verify transactions that leaves cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner controls personal data better and can be anonymous way. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Suffice it to report only address that can be &quot;photographed and distiuguished&quot; the phone, Pierre Noiza indicates, asserting that it already has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend of revising hierarchical systems in favour of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before Bitcoin would be adopted, will be some time, but 2013 could be a turning point&quot;, he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The European Central Bank in the report suggests to review, by the way, the various risks that are seen as the raised, in the case of the success of this system. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> What&apos;s next? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops left the area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans have to follow them at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> For the Afghan army it is time to regain control of territory, and for Afghans to choose the future, without looking only for us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The Afghan villagers whom we considered terrorists suffered from us in general. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers and wounded and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The taliban be foreign extremists, the former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign army as it did at the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajik join them. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Them suffer, they are aided sometimes by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West will start to behave more delicately. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from base Nidzhrab I saw from the hills set with almond trees thanks to the French loans made in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armor, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Since the end of 2014, of the invasion of the Taliban into Kabul will not be. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since their overwhelming advance from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> At that time Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The arresting country control then was perceived as a kind of release, return to security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women paid for rear-guardism of these farmers in which they were surpassed by Al-Qaeda, but the situation has not improved today. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The former mojahideen, the Afghan government and present the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have become entrepreneurs using public lands to resell them for the building to immigrants who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, with the vast American contracts for a contract manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are discredited; Most of them, by the way, even were not at war. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People as I heard in rural areas, want a government that would be not of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave as those who managed the American generosity will leave: Capital outflows is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They lived in the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Some 65 per cent of the population is below the age of 25 years; in Kabul 5 million, a fifth of the general population is now. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is necessary to provide jobs of these young people who will not want to return to either rear-guardism of old parties or corruption of some heads. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everything, including armed militias, love mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap operas, which are the modern world and kind everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> At the moment the army. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities to order, will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The old commanders leading anti-Soviet fight, already take measures to restore provincial teams would not submit to the central authorities. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, highland, with strong local differences should be decentralized to some extent, based on the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that has existed since the Constitution of 1964. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the election scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> The industry was not put on its feet, any dam does not function, any irrigation system is not fixed. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing is done, except fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In the country was on 30 years of war, the state control over infrastructure should be. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Rumors circulated that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> It only strengthened the impression that Western countries were present there, only to take them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy for processing of iron ore and copper on the ground, out-of-pocket transportation to export them through the mountains, no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Chinese almost left the field of copper of the month Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded World bank) dig out a huge Buddhist complex and to be major employers of the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> It is also essential that one day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of import and export depend, restored normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The conclusion of the French combat troops ended on November 20. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation agreement provides the preservation of traditional assistance: School for girls, for boys, French department at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the support of archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009 in an effort &quot;to win the hearts and minds&quot; and to carry out an impossible task of combination of aid offensive operations, maintenance &quot;military and civilian activities&quot; at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) Abolish in 2012, with little French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, with an intense attraction of local labor, could help to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protect soils and increase in the area of arable land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What are we going to leave for the memory of, having spent two billion euros on military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> Much more modest budget would help improve local livelihoods, very hard in these valleys located often at the height more than 2,000 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of a small agricultural work based on local communities in the province of Kapis. </seg>
<seg id="450"> To get rid of the riots directed by foreign groups that wanted by farmers as they told me, it is necessary to give them little not military support that could well be controlled and would come to them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> Difficult confinement of the Constitution of Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is a new risky step of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily places it emergency powers, it decided to go for broke. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Having taken everyone by surprise, he said Wednesday that the Constituent assembly will vote in the final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> It was a week ago, the head of state, provided to the meeting two additional months to finish the job. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Soon two years as Egypt is guided by the provisional text to the proposed amendments were a few times that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> According to his opponents, the President persists in the &quot;autocratic nonsense&quot;, continuing &quot;breaking the word&quot; and &quot;to violate the right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Of the camp of his followers are confident that it is a way to complete institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> The referendum should be held within 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time that forces Brothers to give up the intention to explain to Egyptians text, article after article. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For President it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent storms across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohamed Morsi, seems convinced that Egyptians would vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American Time weekly. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Especially as the call for an expedited vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Or you vote for my text, or I give myself emergency powers&quot; that is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>

<seg id="601"> The initiative regarding the introduction of testing supported both the State Duma and FMS. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But human rights defenders before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the question in the press: and what it would actually give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What will change commitment of language skills, both for Russians, and for visitors? </seg>
<seg id="604"> Above all, representatives of the immigration service answer, would reduce the number of people who suffer from &quot;labor slavery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="605"> So many now talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, the head of the representation of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan viktar Sebelev explains. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of their rights should start to their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organized kit will allow us to solve the problems of foreign workers for 90%. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Problems appear at migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not with physical exam. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding of language, &quot;Sebelev is confident,&quot; future migrant is bound to face unfair people under the guise of a bailout would put to them &quot;permit&quot; in a spooky close barracks where she and dozens like it for months will languish without food and documents, pointing to 12-14 hours a day. </seg>

<seg id="613"> Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics gathering for work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country sought, but also on His Own write yourself. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, it is not so much their wine, how much trouble: the few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even a robust primary education. </seg>

<seg id="617"> It is difficult if it is wrong with knowledge of the language, they confess. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel small and immiserizing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, on the law on language human rights defenders note one important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Testing will be carried out only for migrants who have the legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If the status is not - will be neither examination nor the subsequent official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, most of the gastarbeiter still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome, and stranger entry is prohibited&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors claim that it is not easy to be granted official status in our country. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and the same language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> And here false registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Members of the Russian police knows that we have mostly false documents, there is no registration, hence extortion cases. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Asked one hundred, two on cigarettes, tea&quot;, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Hushkadamov shared with journalists. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Travel, do not be stingy with, buy painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> In the first date of the law on language it became clear that false are not only migrant documents for registration. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Some &quot;fraudulent&quot; evidence of the passing of language tests have already been seized by officers of the FMS. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Counterfeit papers are published in the common colour printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, the new owners had bought them not for nothing: each of the migrants hoping to make it easier for the challenge of taking tests paid 7,000 rubbles for the document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is more than two times more expensive than procedure of official testing: It will cost a migrant three thousand. </seg>
<seg id="636"> That the main challenge in the near future, in order to defend the system of corruption that &quot;crusts&quot; could not be bought just meet, and authorities, and human rights defenders. </seg>
<seg id="637"> While the authorities may promise to the guest workers who have not managed to successfully test the first time, time to study the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, the visitors who do not know the Russian, work in areas that are not that actively communicate with people will be offered. </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Interior Ministry does not pick up the illegal market of weapons </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crime using a legal weapon is smallest </seg>
<seg id="641"> The Ministry of Interior of Russia proposes to tighten the law against owners of the civil weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is a reaction by the authorities to recent incidents: To press shots at weddings when no victims, and the massacres committed by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which hit seven people were killed. </seg>
<seg id="643"> Police want to ban for травматики in public places and to raise the age from which it is possible to obtain a license for weapons ranging from 18 to 21. </seg>
<seg id="644"> The idea was supported by the head of the State Duma Committee on Security and anti-corruption efforts Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the law on the weapons would make the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities try to address the problem by &quot;pulling the plug&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Online there was an open letter, which sponsors, representatives of the different public shooting organizations - demand to give up &quot;pointless tightening&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The hooliganism percent with a registered weapons is minimal, lawyer-criminalist vassiliy Lesnikov told the Russian BBC service. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the US workers of fast food and supermarkets strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Through working at the box office &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; switching to a quarter of all American teenagers </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days across America, the wave of protests against low wages in department stores Walmart corporation and restaurants of popular networks of fast food, such as &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, &quot;A burger King&quot;, &quot;Tako Bell&quot;, &quot;Uendis&quot; and &quot;Kentucky фрайд чикен&quot; a ride. </seg>
<seg id="725"> While no one is to predict whether this wave will become the highest surge or it is destined to exhaust in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Actions support unions and a number of the left public organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Except raise modest salaries that are received by ordinary workers of Walmart and system of fast food, the goal of the organizers of protests is the creation of union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="728"> While the economy is not covered by almost trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Action began last week after Thanksgiving, known as &quot;Black Friday&quot; when the orgy of cheap sales, which took million inhabitants and sometimes accompanied battles hit America. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some employees of Walmart Corporation where 2.2 million people around the world work, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and leftist activists corporation stores, whose products are designed for people of modest and middle prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything from nappies, hunting guns and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores are from an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> So many low-wage workers of Walmart come only at themselves at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Availability and the range of goods produced Walmart of one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell to the podeshevka partly because pays its employees a bit. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of harsh conditions of work, for example, on the shortage of trucks or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The action on &quot;Black Friday&quot; required to raise wages and complained that the cost of health insurance offered by the company, jumped from 30 to $100 a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> It is too expensive for the typical worker of Walmart receiving 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will raise the srednuy salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost companies $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> It&apos;s about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart entirely shifts growth in wages to the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store would cost them on only 46 cents more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="743"> In the year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note enough that protests occurred in just nine states and did not put corporation any damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued in its shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items in the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> A total of its cash registers at nearly 100 million transactions on &quot;Black Friday&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The representative of the corporation Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left site Huffington Post that jobs have been left behind by a &quot;less than five&quot; employees of Walmart, and that the protest was only &quot;the next public-relations stunt&quot; labor union organized it. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free cash registers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where not Walmart department stores (in this progressive city were their facility, do not favor and so they don&apos;t) and &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The McDonald&apos;s said that it sells billion portions and after that it does not give you sick leave and does not pay you for honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dzhumeyn Williams, member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At present the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast food restaurants increase over time, but not much, and their average ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Less they in this expensive city are not earned by anyone. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As you can exist in New York on the money, for me it is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; missed almost a quarter of the American teenagers who have earned money behind their chips after school, living at parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw it as a major source of their food or planned to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I constantly come interview to staff &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; who complain that have to live for this salary and sometimes even feed on children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, at a forum of the Wall Street Journal a comment that author notices hangs that irresponsibly kids if you don&apos;t know what you will feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The challengers who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that at least $15 an hour began paying cashiers and chefs of the system of fast food, more than doubled their current minimum wages. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the field of fast food trade union organizations were created. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.S. law prohibits the administration to intervene and to punish defenders of the trade union movement by exploitation and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely eases their lives. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But it is difficult to reach a labor union fast food and for obvious reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the main - unusual turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The holdouts </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place in this day and some other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day meeting &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; near Times Square, where some local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who has declared did: &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; said that it sells billion portions and after that it does not give you sick leave and does not pay you for honest work! &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blassio, who said &quot;we must start simultaneously support workers of fast food they achieved fair pay and economic prosperity, which is due to every New Yorker. &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> As described New York Times event, it was the largest such event in the history of American field of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But several hundred people took part in it, and not all of them were employees of a quick catering in New York tens of thousands of people employed. </seg>
<seg id="772"> While it is unclear whether that spark will generate the flames of a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;While to deceive the brain it turns out, the medium&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology the augmented reality subject can be seen recently, mainly through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First in the summer at the annual conference, Google showed a working model, and then in November, it became known that an application for relevant patent was filed by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from talking to the head of group interactive 3D Technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharamom Izadi suggests that for scientists from the company points - a passing phase. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They accept the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Please tell us in general than your research group is concerned? </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are engaged in the interaction of a man with cars, but we try to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> While the humanity in weight is stuck at work stage with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes sticking in them the finger. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look for five to 10 years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the prefix Xbox and sensors of Kinect is a step forward, and almost no Xbox with Kinect is not for sale today, everything interesting sign management. </seg>
<seg id="783"> What is expected ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Despite the fact that Kinect transferred interaction with the physical level, much still occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Input information improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not yet very much. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We try to change it, we are working on right 3D systems of display on the basis of various technologies, including projection. </seg>
<seg id="787"> It is necessary to release the computer world in our own physical, to make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And above all to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> What do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> Popular piece, but will overestimate it? </seg>
<seg id="793"> Certainly it is impossible to call it a panacea - there is a privacy issue, because not there is always want to inform the people around the actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Virtually all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in the niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought over gestures, but not over wide, and with a stingy, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> Thus gestures were removed no device camera, and wrist bracelet fixed movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> While it big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the watch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general the future behind the type of mixed management, for example, жест+голос. </seg>
<seg id="799"> It how? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how do you ask me to give you this to mineral water bank? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say and at the same time will tell. </seg>
<seg id="802"> I usually just say. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Oh, it would be very difficult to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - That is you want to force users to adapt under what may or the car can right now? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Not necessary, but this mutual convergence. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think soon we basically have to work on developing new types of sensors that would allow more precisely than human responses. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This may be, for example, laser sensors, they give good permission for depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> If we are talking about your work with sensors of the Xbox Kinect that claims at you to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is no permission, depth or something? </seg>
<seg id="810"> In principle the present generation is from what can make a start in our work on 3D recognition. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it&apos;s good to get pictures 8 at a speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But it is not megapixels, and as The Matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> From the last point of view, all current technologies for us are not good enough is adds works to designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> That is, it should be remembered not only about permission on axes X and Y and Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed, frames per second is very important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Movements of people are very dynamic, and current 30 fps is fairly small, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betishes made contact sensor of our Redmondsky laboratory with an adjustable slower processing - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern sequental sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between human and cars. </seg>
<seg id="819"> In my work the equivalent of such a device that does not require contacts that frames per second was more really would be useful to me. </seg>
<seg id="820"> And the number of cameras does not need to be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> In Kinect there are now three &quot;chambers&quot; one of which actually - an infrared heatsink, and second, the receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And here is the third chamber is actually normal sensor of visible spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create flexible analogue of Kinect, to be played with the curvature of the location of cameras and to see how this will help with 3D definition of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="827"> As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not submit to the public points. </seg>
<seg id="828"> It doesn&apos;t seem to you that in terms of daily use of technology of augmented reality glasses are one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, all the time to walk about maintaining the smartphone in raised hand, not very comfortable, but here&apos;s what I think: the &quot;passing&quot; augmented reality when on the basis of a cloudy platform you could switch from points to a smartphone, the projection display and further everywhere would be the coolest option. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points is a very personal device, their strength (private things you see only) and, at the same time, weakness, the augmented reality on the basis of items will not allow you to work on virtual objects with others. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Let&apos;s imagine for a moment that manipulation virtual holographic objects in the air may not be available only to Tony Stark from &quot;Iron Man&quot; but also to a mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem that critics of such an idea often point: there is no tactile response. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands don&apos;t feel anything! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group prepares to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In the lectures I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh break of interaction between human and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the admixture of tactile sensations may well be the eighth. </seg>
<seg id="837"> While some interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a kind of a base for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It perfectly registers URGENT! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving here to these &quot;to pictures in the air&quot; to personal - for example, the interference of several focused ultrasound beams in a certain point where there is a finger, gives a sense, but it very weak, as if you blew the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also rings on the wrists that affect nerve endings in fingers is also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> And you tried to cheat the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> To make him think he feels that, it seems, should feel while he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> There&apos;s a good idea, we have not yet try to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here&apos;s another problem that must be resisted for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in confined spaces is to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite is worked and over concepts of treadmills (not so such as in clubs), moving platforms as well as huge areas. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While to deceive the brain it turns out, the medium, is still very much for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Here&apos;s what makes working on so attractive virtual reality for the researcher is many things in a very rudimentary. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Vkusovshchina instead of culture - Rosbalt.R </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Росбалт&quot; continues the Petersburg avangarde project on the Nationals ahead, at the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Brilliant figures of the art scene in St Petersburg already entered the top list, whose achievements are outside the city, often finding recognition in Europe, held the All-Russia Popular. </seg>
<seg id="850"> &quot;Rosbalt&apos;s&quot; new hero is a controversial artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man, dressed all in red, which is found in the Russian Museum, at a summer garden, on fashion parties and the opening days. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Kirill Miller&apos;s paintings always collect crowds of the audience where they would not be exposed. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one particularly Petersburg social and philosophical narrators, founders of new mythology. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a brilliant man of the Petersburg the vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> He is the face of the city, the appearance on the streets raising a smile at the citizens, lightening the mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently took a street organ in hand and became the Petersburg organ-grinder as ripe for this complex role in all the bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Cyril and why you still go to the city in all red, not in yellow or turquois, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I  chose red as a fashion designer who is dealing with the look and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although society everything slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations were designed to ensure that the conversation began. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The history of my agiationary reserves - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> And when did you realize you should be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> At an exhibition in the DC nevskaya where my drawings were exposed. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I knew it was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then the wave of old free informal artists has passed, and new, free like me were unclear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I began to be friendly with artists of a new wave, with a postgazonevshchina that brought &quot;Pushkin-10&quot; and more wave was not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I get into the theater, clothing, music, in all genres, except the word. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And that united in your Art clinic... It was important for me to go to the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative power should gather. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied on Pushkin-10, and there, when there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born: NOMY, Tequila jazz, I remember Cord brought to the Van Gogh&apos;s Ear project. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends lip-synched easy songs, they were in tight body stockings, among them was fashionable now a composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the band played live, it became &quot;leningradskaya&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg was the host many programs to hali-galivsky times. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trakhtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and he we was received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The D 137 gallery, club &quot;Griboyedov is echoes from Art clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> There our employees and frequent visitors left. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I&apos;m a hero of yesterday&apos;s century when the culture something meant. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, the inquiry was in the press, the prize was &quot;people in our city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the nomination &quot;Artist of the year&quot; I was called, my climax came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In modern times by the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years it&apos;s easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are shared, it is possible to be popular, but not a cultural. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The easily-recognizable  manner is inherent in your work. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Many of my pictures are hits, they imposed relevance and sharpness. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have the program exhibition &quot;The Russian Museum in clowns&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I social was before, is this is sick and scary. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But in the clowns everything is loose, the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the world rescue by totalitarian mask by order. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now on clothes meet, guided by external mechanics rather than on the inner man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> And maybe he could not offer a hand and Roger should spit. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And fraud will be removed by mask. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - And recently we saw you as a city organ-grinder. The cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> And who, as not me, be it. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Well can and commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Now commercial art should be clear, considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> There is a collapse of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before people got off in packs, bohemia loved one, gawks another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now all broke into microcommunities, now difficult it will be good for all. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to be pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we need to think it&apos;s nice to whom. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now every cult hero for 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - And Stas Mikhailov comes into thousands! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - Broshenka come to him, there the sekso-social sphere works. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And on the cultural soil of 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result there is less than the office, money, all wither. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive, not to spoil the cash. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote these pictures to young people that one collector has them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov pisgs. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with pictures that usually finish. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse concepts. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Say: culture spiritual, a culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture at consumption, that&apos;s quite another thing. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the culture of yesterday, grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Cyril that lacks to St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a notion: An official from culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can be engaged in culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> At the correct tzars everything wrong was the Kings, maybe, not really knew in culture, but they knew it was necessary to have the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here in Moscow is now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We in Petersburg have people that could be experts, but they are pushed as higher experts who correctly assess these experts are necessary and will let them pass. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now the vkusovshchinka flourish. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but recognizes them that they honestly say that not we accept all modern art, there are artists who have to find myself other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> What is for you - Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow cultures is much more, there the ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our rocks to art raise complex. </seg>
<seg id="927"> The cultural ground we want, and we now have more than writers than readers, it is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Here in Europe, there are a lot of people curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to be fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project has been implemented through a grant of st.-petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> To give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The ground in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or a collision with an asteroid killer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans spacecraft with earthmen aboard set off in search of spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, there is a key question how to continue its kind in the context of weightlessness or on the same extra planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think the choice is limited. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Real planets only two that can be managed at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It is Venus and Mars&quot; - a senior fellow at the State ubai the name of P. K. Shternberg (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin said. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if Mars conditions more liveable, on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> It is possible to live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Started coming to reproduction questions in space from flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century more done experiments on plants back. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from the Earth&apos;s species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then the removal in the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 to space sent eggs from quail to find out how the embryo in the context of weightlessness develops. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We arrive at the release of a normal baby birds. </seg>
<seg id="948"> And here&apos;s the problem starts further. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem that this baby bird must find a support, he has to get up on the legs and start moving&quot;, the head of the laboratory of the Institute for Biomedical problems (IMP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev explains. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Not finding support, chicks arbitrarily somersaulted. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And in 10 hours newborns had a full atrophy instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Chicks did not respond to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there the trouble was that in four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And twice we вылупляли chicks after he refused because it is impossible to work there with them&quot; - state an experiment failure with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With animals the last time biological &quot;miniark&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But the Bion biosatellite there is only gay individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats who were sent to the space already with the fruit. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there have not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It has just been on biosatellites, but again is a separate experiment, and such research should be done&quot;, Vladimir Sychev notes. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing space rats had offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But to approach the playback problem directly in space will not turn out yet. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, familiar habitat, simply cannot understand sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, unlike animals could potentially. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and be able to create the right emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons such experiments are not done. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women travel to space 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Tereshkova had the biggest risk. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious that humanity has is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our Gull has departed, and nobody on Earth couldn&apos;t say: whether it will remain after flying in space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;No one answered the question&quot; - a veteran of rocket and space industry vahtang Vachnadze says. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after flying in space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child Andriyan nicolaevsky was also an astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 at the second female astronaut Svetlana Savitskaya who twice visited orbit and even worked in open space, the son was born. </seg>
<seg id="977"> But the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We don&apos;t have enough, the units has astronauts who after long flights all cost, and a healthy generation grows. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if it is more, this is dangerous, even with orbital flights&quot; - space pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov concludes. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Still, humanity needs to look for any new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> TsPK hydrolaboratory - a necessary preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in the face of zero held test-cosmonaut meet skills in outer space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water mimics weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If adults water, let and comfortable, and the alien environment for babies - native elements. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small ихтиандры as if confirm that life on land left the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a link between what the baby is about nine months at his mother in okoplodny liquid, it is easier for him to get used then water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle it is logical because of the moment of birth, since that first air goes only two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is not enough that something to forget&quot;, the instructor of baby swimming Marina Aksenova says. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the born child weightlessness more natural state, is necessary for a woman gravity, gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quickly in weightlessness the abdomen, the pelvis grow decrepit, the ability to fruit pushing falls. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, we will also reduce it, relying on stimulants generic activities. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can go, of course, in a special camera for delivery, it will push it out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what? &quot;says Valery Polyakov requests unconventional questions. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, artificial gravity too should the child. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without feeling Earth&apos;s gravity, the body will not create a skeleton and muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The newborn in orbit, it is impossible as adult, to dress in a special download outfit for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It is just denied that he would be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment for which we will go, allowing the birth of a baby in an alien environment, will lead to that we will lead to a land of a disabled person, fully deadapted man&quot;, the head of the bioethics committee of IMBP Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov expects. </seg>
<seg id="999"> While the birth of children in space - the theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, later time, it will be reality when earthmen on ships will go on a far-out planet that is home to their descendants born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Head of the Head audit division: Check shvarts-system failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the branches of government procurement the Czech Republic has a good control authorities and, despite a good law lags behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> Miroslav Kal&apos;s this statement, vice president of the Supreme Audit Office in an interview for the site Aktuáln ě. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, that, in my view, we don&apos;t have enough&quot;, commented on Kal&apos;s situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The same conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of bad practices give Jane Q Nechas&apos;s approach to the so-called shvarts-system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the prime minister stated that CDP (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - there is this is prohibited or zvierata? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;The law should somehow be established, and if it prohibits something, and the prime minister cannot resist the work of the institutions to which he had a responsibility to try and achieve obligations&quot;, Callas states. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties within the laws on public procurement of both countries was compared. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly has been discussed? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Parallel check that we began perhaps two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In other words, the speech that the European legislation claims how must pass government procurement, follows the national legislation and then its use in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All information is collected and, even while still unfinished check interesting differences in other words were found, we can have the law &quot;precise and perfect&quot; but in practice we in some settings yield to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows that it is not enough to create more and more following rules, we need to focus on the application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Indeed, as this project can help you, what it means for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> The joint control can make a contribution to a stop to clarify the law, reduction and improved restrictions because it does not lead to a positive result. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The economy means obtaining thing for reasonable (but not always low) the price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But not the fact that we can get there, having reduced limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system will be filled with &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find holes in the system, will find them much easier than if restrictions did not decline. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about domestic issues of practical application of the legislation on government procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> And how the monitoring system in Germany work? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there an organization such as our CAM (audit office) and it works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> As for institutions, there Bundesrechnungshof arranged by our principle acts as our Kru, there is also the board working a little differently, but mostly both institutions function similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the authority to some extent is similar, but as Germany has federal structure, there are parts of the audit and at the level of federal lands in their system is different from our little. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH can manage the federal money, we have public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal Audit Chambers. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As for the local laws, there it is easier than those of us? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general, I wouldn&apos;t want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany may be imitated, but it is impossible to say that it is better in all. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> So, because they cope with greater control over? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but I repeat, such comparisons are not pleased. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But it is necessary to say that even the model countries face many problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not get any benefit from working with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Speaking about the domestic law how were reflected in your establishment of an amendment to the law on government procurement, the consequences are somehow manifest itself? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the validity of these amendments is quite short, this was not shown in any way in our work on control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we implement controls on, it must be some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> We take that into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we began to use our new tool &quot;The discovery of the risk of not the economy&quot; through which we sent nearly 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be shown because restrictions change terms of certain types of tenders and so on change. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden of bureaucracy system? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Problem that can occur, such is that the rules &quot;will be increasingly strict&quot; and they cannot be observed. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> When functioning the previous rules controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (for example, regional operational-level programs - with regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement would constitute a breach of budget discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Is it worth tightening in that case, the law in such a way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I think that not the way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to take and abuse, but not to punish those who make a formal mistake that leaving the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> This system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And while to leave this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us know that this path will lead you to nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the prime minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs checks of the so-called shvarts-system. What does it mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;Schwartz system&quot; is prohibited or resolved? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should somehow be established, and if it prohibits something, and the prime minister cannot resist the work of the bodies to which he had a responsibility to check and make implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It is possible to say: &quot;We will change the law and we will solve it&quot; but it is impossible to say that we will pretend as if nothing happens. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules like that should be made formally, and rightly so. It would protect government procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, that, in my view, there isn&apos;t enough. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Roads in places slippery, but are mostly traveled. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> In some places, Czech Republic Road frozen and snowy. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to save up positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think that in less than a month there must come the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> It is only one of the many disturbing news on which humans so easily come across. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Together with The Tap Tap group we constantly joke on the subject and we say that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect relatively positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, in December, you are going to give a unique three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> You could have more to say about it to readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a matter of national fund-raising activities that we plan for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential that the calendar Maya that end it is announced on December 21 at 11:10 has. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> A day before the event, on December 20th at 21:00 parallelly start three concerts in Prague, the exhibition in Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will end, roughly speaking, while on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean that time zone to 12 hours earlier than we will come to the end of the May calendar. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who did this idea come to mind? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially it was my idea, then we all thought out together with our artist Gonza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Besides the fact that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public over the state in which we will take once the world to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> To mark the end of the May calendar we created a unique collection of objects from shoes and T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the site www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time to give us support. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The Tap Tap group along with other musicians also completed the anthem at the end of the world that the end of the world is called &quot;canceled&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Whether YouTube has already fallen in love to the audience the anthem at these benefit performance concerts will sound? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, right at the end, if as a result, it turns out, and the world would not come. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be started singing by all artists at all concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Anthems at the same time, will begin to sound also on the air of the Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Words to this song tomá Ganak wrote and played Jesus&apos; role in the clip, is carried out by Xindl X... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you start cooperating with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also work with other people of the Czech cultural life as we have a lot of charity events and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try to connect them to these projects actively. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that much like to work with us, it is interesting for them. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> That comes from a concert at the end of the world will go? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> On the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year, we so work with civil association Tap at Edlichki&apos;s institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers regularly students of schools of the Institute of Edlichki and hold with them fun and interesting events. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Students have no way to go to teachers, and we try to give them the opportunity in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> The project of additional construction of the Institute of Edlichki in the future will occur separately the building to which we will move with the project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At each concert will speak some bands and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> That selection criteria were? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We tried to make the program that will interest all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague Chinaski as Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jerzy Sukhi will act. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> About all the details you can learn on the site www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Do you any such plan &quot;grandiouse action&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we would love to perform representation in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, really want to act in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About abroad you serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics? ? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not so terrible as it may seem at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their carriages have to travel in the cargo hold, plus all the large number of goods and containers of tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, while handled it, without problems. The Czech airlines Č SA and the British airlines British Airways always perfectly for us were prepared to me how many times surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of availability, a relationship of the public towards disabled people and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What do you faced by now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than ours, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared to Prague in Moscow there are a lot of barriers, and here in surprise Independent Travel, a man on an electric wheelchair in the city centre is still. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> And there not during such basic things how to give way to a disabled person in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, and there were already public organizations who try to draw the attention of people to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And what, on the contrary, we always have to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things that level of performance far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to point out that improvement always depends on the efforts of those people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid it is normal that people with severe disabilities independently move on the streets, can go to the toilet, in a museum and elsewhere... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> What a large number of people with disabilities, we are actively engaged in public life, it them with The Tap Tap a bit is not very common we promote! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public or accessibility is one thing, but at the moment when among us there will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then things really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> While it is isolated cases, strong-willed individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap group is very popular now, but we will return for two years ago that in 1998 you caused him to arrange? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I entered Edlichki&apos;s institute as a mentor, around me, there were many young people who wanted to do something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am a musician, and I play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, and over time, as our leader Ladya Angelovich says, it gets out of control (laughs) a little. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Popularity came only in recent years, or I confuse something? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true, we were helped by that we began embracing the famous singers and actively working on group propaganda. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We concluded that the work that no one can estimate, in fact it doesn&apos;t exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Whether it was you a goal so well to promote their Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt like their potential in the ability to do something unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In the entertainment industry is full of things, imitating one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It is logical, all new is taken with caution, and it lasts long. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression at the man who sees us, of course, sorry, it is natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is completely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not any suffering and all abandoned persons for whom we have to feel sorry. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are people who can live a life and develop, of course, only on condition that they have the resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities something turns out, it is a shift not only for them, but for society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> If given the success you strict head that you are considered by many? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the work properly, we have to be uncompromising in many things and hold a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it is normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic representation and fly in the clouds and to learn that twice a week, they must go to rehearsal, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the way, very quickly losing enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it is happening in any group that wants to work and something to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Now as part of a Tap Tap group twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How much they were at the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one entering Angelovich. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We open group, people come and go, it cannot be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who desire and will power, our doors are open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba stadium, in Brno in Fléda club and Ostrava in the Plynojem centre involving 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> In concert end all three cities connect a teleconference at the time of the performance of the song of The Tap Tap &quot;the world Is Cancelled&quot; the group. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The purpose of this project is to raise funds of 25 million kroons to buy a multifunctional barrier-free equipment for an educational center STUDEO at Edlichki&apos;s institute in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> A ticket to the concert costs 400 czk for children under 12 years admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at the ministerial meeting of the European space agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ECA on September 12, 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland started close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and in subsequent years, took an active part in a number of projects of agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But space Poland started your career much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before World War II Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, lecture of A. Shternfeld who presented on 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from the innovative work &quot;The introduction to outer space&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The idea of a young engineer (1905) left audiences indifferent, after several years Shternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, in France Shternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and andrè Luis Hirsh&apos;s award for &quot;The introduction in outer space&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899, 1966) about whom mentioned above, has become a great promoter of astronomy and space later. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He published in the Polish magazines, hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomsky became a well-known advocate for outer space, and his contribution was estimated including that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925 in Poland, the railway section car equipped with a rocket engine was built. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as well as project details. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear even to disperse or to stall who the rocket had to be used. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information on this section car is known only from the press of that era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933 the Polish artillery started thinking about the missile arrows. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The study was conducted by Section of the equipment of arms in cooperation with professors Mieczyslaw Volfke and Gustav Mokzhizki. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the remaining material you can see that studies have reached a stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of the German armies of work were interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937 in the specialized press there was an idea of the photovoltaic missile fighter, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, and next year there was a work &quot;The air missile torpedo- and aviation rocket bomb&quot; the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotsky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects have been developed for military use rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war by all the projects of military use of rocket technology the Interim Scientific Advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that agreed on the work was doing. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> The next scientific work dedicated to outer space, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of Polish society space (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time society mentioned in the November issue of 1954 of the Problemy magazine in which four volume articles on space are published. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, a professor of M. Subotovich offered to organize society that are in space science. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time already projects of artificial satellites grew, and it was clear that space exploration is promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 Polish society space (PSA) tried to enter the international federation of outer space (established in 1951) and in the fall of POA become a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And next year the first president of the POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 a 1959) became the deputy head of the International federation of outer space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> At this position, it was the most death, which came in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956 of POA made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological RM missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) that became the first Polish rocket, which has made a scientific study. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957, and the first going-live was on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was at length about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Subsequently, the advanced RM-1A version was built, and in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovsky wasteland tests of a two-tier RM-2 missile is carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This missile was at length about 1.4 metres, and its weight was about 11,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the rocket was able to deal in the real scientific work - RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 kilometers, and the supervision of the high-rise wind was his task. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962, the further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965 became the successor of the first RM missiles. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a two-tier, its overall length made 5-10 cm, and initial weight - 32,5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three types (described as the Meteor-1А, 1B and 1C) that was different with the chamber size for the scientific equipment were developed. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor-1А rocket had space of 0,4 l, Meteor-1В - 0,34 l and Meteor-1С - 0,62л. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range of flight all three types had 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Between 1965 and 1968 in Aviation institute hosted the development of Meteor-2 rocket and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The Meteor-2 missile with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring the payload weighing 10 kilograms to altitude of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then Meteor-2Н versions and Meteor-3 were built. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is worth mentioning also Poland&apos;s accession to KOSPAR (the Committee on Space Exploration) in 1960 and KOSPAR national committee created in two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second Vladimir Remek&apos;s interkosmonavty ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Repeal the law on public works is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the constitutional court overturned the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> The resolution has created lively discussion in society. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Of course, it will be interesting to look at these issues from a broader view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal focused economies in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In fact this means that separate economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> It is related to the principle of free trade and free, unfettered private capital flows with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> A significant difference in labor costs (wages) has caused a price tension. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is necessary to understand the state where a producer by giving cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition that &quot;pushing&quot; the cost of a competitor in order to take up a large part of the market and thus increase their own income as the concept. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> On a massive scale it means for most entrepreneurs or production transfer abroad, or cheap purchases, or extinction. As a result, unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared with others, a high increases. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> As a private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including unemployment making inevitable costs of the state for the social needs grow. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> As a whole, the situation reinforces the reluctance of gentlemen businessmen to pay taxes and thereby to compensate for the public economic and social damage caused by them in pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well-known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Off-hand methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states at a time when governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially lower social level of the population to bring to the country of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments give their own population of abuses to the private capital, despite the social decline. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected primarily in current law changes. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is economically to force the ​ ​ people to obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It works as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time, serves as a tool to reduce the rights of workers in the field of labor laws. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result, the poverty rate, at the same time, and the difference between rich and poor increasing. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany some years, there is a public distribution of products poor who are unable to support his own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people already approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In improving the competitiveness of German economy constantly there are cases when hired people receive such pay that the state must pay extra to them that they receive a living wage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Similar scandal became known the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures almost certainly bring in all southern EU states in addition to the state in which the people who are under pressure from catastrophic collapse of the social status, need either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist for pitiful salaries margins of society in the hope that someday the private investment capital will come to the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But it is requested, from where it will take? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty to move from one country to another, or it will not come in general since the Chinese, Indian, the Brazilian, Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still works for a share of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its economy that the controlled economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> The private capital has persisted that the state should stay current promotions to the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> It should be further answer the question of whether private capital, which is now almost the policy and the entire state, in their own selfish purposes work? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> A particular answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The evidence is the existence of nearly omnipotent and ubiquitous true-hands in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have a hopeless situation that is showing in corruption, achieve mutual benefits, the law, almost all deserves punishment, but it is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries because of lack of funds charge the development of the bill to private law firms that are closely linked industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then the bills approved by the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people as the constitution of the western type said, and from the financial and powerful groups that favor their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that liberal oriented democracy now quickly appears in such ​ ​ situations as described by Appian in their work &quot;Crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar and Pompey&apos;s Days&quot;: &quot;The state breaks up for a long time, and agencies are involved in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal gain favor with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The bribery and corruption flourished without any ban and люд went to the election with in advance sold voice &quot;&quot;... decent people did not stand at all to the position of the governor ultimately once the state for eight months without consul &quot;. . &quot;Seriously started saying that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need for the choice of energetic person&quot;. Appian thought it would be Pompeii, but Caesar who ultimately replaced democracy with autocracy was him. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in modern society own reckless interests without public interests prevail. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private equity already essentially is not intended for use in a public purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> This result does not differ from the past: unprecedented decline of the elite without any efforts to reform of deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause of fascist and Communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of economies of 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Today, lack of these regimes and the availability of democracy of liberal type can be seen as a pause after which the next round is expected. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First of all that the current elite ignores effects in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social ills that we now see, along with crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and modern history is tragic. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Repeal the law on public works is not the solution or at least not forever. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure of competition, at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further cuts in social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is systemic in nature. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The decision is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen individual share of the state&apos;s economy will strengthen the role of citizens in government and will weaken monopolies of private capital in society in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: Chaos laboratory. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Violence fails, and may never leave&quot; - Sting, the song &quot;Fragile&quot; where the main verse chorus are words: &quot;We don&apos;t forget that we fragile&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons didn&apos;t want war, they would not be&quot; dying Gutel Shnaper, Meer Amshel Rothschild wife. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza Strip, as always, caused a lot of feedback. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> One play for Israel, arguing its position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing it is racism of the Jewish state, the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel, the role of a terrorist state is. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I don&apos;t want to reflect on who in these recurring waves of murder is a criminal and who the victim, after all, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and violence beginning did not witness. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain to see the one who first 95 years that has lasted tension (including from signing the Declaration of Balfur in November, 1917) on a small ground of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my reasoning are buttressed up historical by facts, some of them are made on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a power struggle history. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> We can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon in every era. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> That is not clear whether always these people completely independently took the steps, or behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to promote goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We should assume that we live in a time when the global wealth is concentrated among a few persons, and that this concentration of money and power emanating from them could not happen for a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> One that could be considered as head of the octopus (I don&apos;t know if there is someone above them, but it&apos;s possible) is distinguished from astronomically wealthy families - Rotshilda. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Of them don&apos;t write a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Рейтерс) they bought in the 1990s, the 19th century to stop the rumors linking them with criminal action in higher areas in which shadow they were and which has always led to strengthen their power, accumulation of wealth or both that and another. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have significant equity stakes in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they have a share, they were fighting or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were five countries, after Qaddafi&apos;s ouster has only four, but at the same time the Russian government has taken the country&apos;s central bank in hand). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for Rotshildovsky of Bank of America, during the civil war he started producing its own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. The deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Federal Reserve for setting of the Great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for a world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan of three world wars created by the great mason of the 33-th level by Albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The destruction of monarchical states in Europe was a problem of the first war, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third is to reduce the world&apos;s population to about 0,5-1 billion (so many slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume many resources), creating a single universal religion (the ecumenism cannot be anything other than as a precondition for the project) and eventual capture of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Method by means of which the group of the richest families led by Rotshildami works, the call of crisis and the subsequent offer of decisions (order ab chao - an order from chaos) is. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these decisions are false and always lead to the deteriorating situation (see the basis of FED, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> So, after they managed to launch World War I through the murder of Habsburg successor of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, inaugurating the bolshevic revolyutsiiya. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> World War I ended a sudden, unreasonable in the military and economic relations with the surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need to fight for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a collapse of the Central European authority, Austria-Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate unleashing the World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, having imposed on Germany huge war reparations than created a prerequisite to radicalization of impoverished masses, then it was necessary to throw only to the Germans strong enough, exposing guilty and a leader in offering simple solutions, further to create multinational czeckoslovakia with strong German minority that was to play, and indeed played function of the fifth column, when fuel fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century Rotshilda provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, which one branch sought to create the Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour above declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with local Arab population started happening. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler from chains in which he was initially by bankers, or all escaped that he did was planned, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps set the stage for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as Germany was triggered by war reparations to the second world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to establish a center of the War of the third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, become a victim of operations on the front lines, now with Arab or in other words, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is as if huge laboratory, a strife and chaos source not only in the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who are guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the offence causes offence in the endless chain of violence if it all started with greed of individuals and their desire for a world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Here we need to distinguish between ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we, the international bankers palm off on people to vote in elections exclusively their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu&apos;s hawk is a typical example fascist, loyal to the international bankers a politician, doing everything to go to war with Iran, which, thanks to membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan... ) would threaten to develop into the world conflict, and given the containment of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz contained 20% of all the world&apos;s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - will also lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In that light the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 are revealed: &quot;What we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The new world order in their view is the world of Lord and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world where each born body at birth implant the chip with which it is a creature in total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to be on the right hand or on the forehead brand, so that the person who is not marked by the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could not buy sell. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here&apos;s the wisdom: Anyone who has a reason, can calculate the number of an animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it corresponds to the name human, and the number six hundred and sixty six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Film &quot;Operation&quot; jargon &quot;: When worse than ever, cause Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, the crowd of Islamic students demonstrators stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and taken hostage 52 diplomats. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They had to be released in exchange for deposed the shah Mohammed Reza Pekhlevi running after the revolution in the United States that have been a protector of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the US administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not assumed she could not afford to throw the shah overboard because it fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> But to reach the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it could not. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free hostages force later. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The put diplomats were eventually released 444 days later, after talks mediated by the government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate caused houses a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran contributed mightily to Jimmy Carter&apos;s defeat on the presidential election in 1980, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film directed by the actor Ben Affleck &quot;the Operation&quot; jargon &quot;describes one of episodes of the story brought to America small victories. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After a difficult peripetias they finished the way to residences of the Canadian embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, the extravagant legend of cover, according to which they left according to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew who were looking for in the country a place to shoot a science-fiction epic thus helped. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Mix of genres </seg>

<seg id="1350"> That the legend was reliable, in trade magazines have been written about the draft of the film, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company had real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Operation details have long been kept secret, the film is based on Tony Mendes&apos;s memories. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck&apos;s movie is a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called &quot;film, the film opus&quot;, the history of the successful invention, cheating is an example can be a number of films about Ouchene&apos;s friends. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film sentiment - on the one hand, documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in loans sign historic photographs of events are shown and how the same situations were shown in the film, big differences in it are not present) constantly changing. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood fragments that cross with irony and moderate exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating table, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck wonderful managed to make career restart. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From the mocked actor became a respected director, and his game has become the object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;The operation&quot; jargon &quot;his third feature film, after the dark detective&quot; Farewell, Child, Farewell &quot;(2007) and thriller&quot; City &quot;(2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is the first film Affleck not shot in the hometown of the director at Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place so belongs to the qualities that exalted earlier movies of the director of the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And Affleck shows it in &quot;jargon&quot; where Tehran is &quot;played&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film happen on the streets, on the reconstruction of real events - opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with the clarity that also conveys emotions of confusion and emergencies arising when somewhere history suddenly changes. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his colleagues reached a similar effect in scenes fictional (fake staff on the Tehran market). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> There are too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with that story does not take lots of exciting scenes of cinema value. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> It has successfully work with the little, sometimes something cums thinking - there&apos;s all this is not as elegant (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, the pursuit on a runway look enough artificially). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The lack of &quot;jargon&quot; is the distraction caused by the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Gudman as Hollywood colleagues are very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they in the film is not the only. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Affleck&apos;s movie lacks a little dramatism, this is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, estimating statement and retrostyle recreate thrillers Seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But is hardly. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense, living history, as well as a testament to how the ideas of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> The rules of inflation of balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com annually leading survey about the most absurd bank fees, decided to announce now competition &quot;the most absurd resolution or the project from the EU workshop&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;We were moved by the latest development in which the EU plans to admit a 40 per cent quota for women to the administrations of major European companies&quot;, the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager told &quot;Right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the book has already put forward for the nomination is the recent decision by the European Court of the Association of the amount of insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Yet women have benefits for life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively less at risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;From the EU workshop people can make further unlikely ideas to competition until the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The vote will take place until the end of February 2013 &quot;, Nager said. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Controversial orders of the EU is, for example, and binding adding biocomponents in fuel that as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the directive on the cell size for chickens, which this year eggs significantly rose in price. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The de facto ban on using the term &quot;sandwich-type oil&quot; or seized from the sale of classical bulbs had been criticized. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The pan-European device often makes the decision under pressure of this or that trade or industrial lobby positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic now even threatened veto defends the requirements of the banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of the margins are as follows: for example, bananas are of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach length 14 cm and did not dare show &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission has come true that only harmonizes existing separate national rules that complicated trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The EU, despite resistance from some states, but softened its standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that the existing guidelines will lead to waste products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the prize in the survey can be and the last year&apos;s resolution of the EU, according to which sold air-balloons should be provided with a warning that children younger than eight years cannot inflate them without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU turned to the American research, according to which air-balloons at games are a potential cause of death among children with asthma. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> This restriction now extends to children under 14, which are forbidden to hit in the exhibition horns. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Funny ideas are born at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Quite absurd and rules on European officials: Anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should say, not &quot;FYROM&quot; (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists &quot;Principle of non-interference&quot; (Laissez Faire) offered to vote, and several above this absurd rules, for example, the rule of the EU on the amount of food in the territory of the member state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU imposed the maximum amount of food supplies that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of her accession to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, a set amount of canned mushrooms, for which he had been threatened by a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Organizers of the questionnaire asked also by the idea to pay some countries that they have no sea, and the idea of grants for approval to receive subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas originated in Prague, rather than in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Let&apos;s ask the European Union for compensation &quot;, Agriculture Minister Jaroslaw Palas (CHSDP) that time stated in the fall of 2004. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument he pointed out that there was a big grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interference purchases, the state should have full warehouses of shares that had to be removed. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the palace had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> As a result, the European commission has moved into the Czech Republic, granting the bidding for grain purchase from the countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for receiving subsidies were offered villages by the Ministry of regional development, directed by the minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU) in particular such subsidies had to go for filing an application for grants of Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU: bizarre orders are an exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although resolutions in member states easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU on regulation and more effective functioning and European Union development, according to many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Serious problem, according to experts, the cherpaniye EU subsidies on projects that have no hint of something in common with deeper European integration, but which member states achieved by budget debate. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Causes emotions among the Czechs and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to the specific identity of the traditional products, she was not always wins in this competition. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> While the Czechs after six years of fighting, with Germans and the Austrians retained the name &quot;Olomoutsky Curd Cakes&quot; but &quot;Tuzemsky Roma&quot; that tradition in our country are rooted in the 19th centuries, our producers had to rename on &quot;Tuzemak&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Products from reed distillate, instead of sugar beets can be called Roma. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous Carlsbad crackers, pogorzhelitskiya and T  ebo  carp and zhatetsky hops appeared &quot;feta&quot; and &quot;gorgondzola&quot; cheeses, marcipan from German lubek or Parma ham, already, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Also Pardubice carrot and gorzhitsky tubes can be proud of the trademark of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want I saved the republic, but I&apos;m a fan, Okamura claims. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. senator how a man comes to mind running for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I don&apos;t think that most to become a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If us in the country all function without problems, I anywhere would not stand. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can&apos;t look any better because over the past 20 years the country is looted as thieves here hustle, people raise taxes and retirement. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I don&apos;t like, I try to find a solution How to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I was 40 years old and I am an independent person than any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You get to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do you turn the back to people who have chosen you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I said all the time that I will join in the fight for the presidential palace, depending on the outcome of elections in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later I pointed out that if I will be selected as a senator, I will run for president. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not a position, the position is a tool through which I can carry out their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need the greatest influence and the largest powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the difficulty not only that we as a nation nagging at ourselves in a bar or at the TV, but they are ready to crush anyone who will try to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> To the media, which demonize the person and confuse freedom of speech to freedom of lies are added. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, about me said I embute journalists, or that I was Jerzy paroubek said&apos;s advisor. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let&apos;s go to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> For the presidential palace you started fighting theses about material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of declarations of assets worth over 20 million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> What to do it, it is necessary to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You as president of such powers not, and only the rest of the senate can offer laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbied that holding a excursions became free enterprise, he managed to be promoted. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is playing politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately obstructing, which discourages citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent non-party person I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage that I have no party unfolding on the shelves, without regard to exercises can take what is best for our country from each party and to apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Are you the person more related to the right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people carry me quite to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it doesn&apos;t matter - a bit to the left or a little to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me it is important that we went forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> This does not mean that someone is right, and someone left, I want to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I will always support any good decision for society, will offer its KPChM or GDP, and I in the same way will be against a bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You are angry when someone says you a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But you prove what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for the company, you have any ideal purposes and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And you try to approach it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all offers that I say, already operate in the world, or prominent experts say about them. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the parliament are you still have only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with it in politics you trainling do not hold. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or did you think when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize Criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other choice. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to win them over what we achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, would not be a problem to organize live television broadcast in which I will address the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they in case of failure, will have to say why they don&apos;t want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality who will sound abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take direct presidential elections are there was pressure credit from the public. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say directly that I am a fan, not a genius, and not the intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I only a newie in politics and for the program will try to gain majority support. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I put I try to promote yourself; If it does not work well, in six years I&apos;ve finished and I will return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> That&apos;s part sounds as if Okamura must save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I not saviour. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one I will do nothing, so I went around a number of famous people with an offer to stand up for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> And I at least supported the journalist Ian Lorentsova leading the investigation who opened fraud with light fuel oil products. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I proposed a candidate because people really are not satisfied, but now I feel at stake. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not go to elections, and most of those who went elected representatives of establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Us independent in the Senate only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for his views, for example, for direct election of mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the basis of his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I didn&apos;t think of it because I have no time to check the purity of the last each potential supporter, and I have no money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money and for presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about declarations of assets and how your own affairs with it? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a site in Prague, worth about 25 million, an apartment on 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art around 10 million, Aston Martin by 3.5 million and Shkoda Superb per million, and some of millions more on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way Aston Martin I came because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who went by the car, was brave with women and at the same time have attemptd pettiness and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You go by Aston-Martin, proanimatedy 60 million and you have no money to campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want to change the republic, but their own money in particular I don&apos;t want to invest. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have no 15 million on campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I have to go into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I invested already 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not so interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign from the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Spending on campaign to me in fact will be covered by the Senate salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But on this money I would not live, for example, could pay to his son for English school, which costs 30,000 monthly. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to make money, so anywhere would not stand. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Means, then you will carry on business that it was possible to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Did you not say that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the wages. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partly reduced their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy becomes managing director of travel agents in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I was an unselfish person who will keep the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to do something for a living. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How many how the businessman, you are used to receive monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From two hundred and four hundred thousand that I get on. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I became president, the business would finish. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find the full interview on Saturday issue of the newspaper &quot;Right&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only in the imagination on the example of Spijkenisse and its newly built Book Hill - 2 Pictures </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;The building seems to me fun, it looks futuristic, finally we again, you can see something interesting&quot;, Lizette Verkhayg, pedestrians on the edge of the road says. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, information technology specialist in a large company located in the area, said this: &quot;No, this building is indeed beautiful&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder: Why us today another library? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, the iPad and electronic books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Has anyone voluntary does not go to such old-fashioned libraries, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, low-remarkable sleeping town near Rotterdam, is an unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest levels of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat this unfortunate fact it was a few years ago decided to make a contribution to the general education and to build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro notes, in the form of picturesquely painted thumbnail of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then fathers of the city knew that they have only able to overcome statistics: to build here library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Blame the Meuse in Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold column charts and the author witty, sometimes even cynical structures, to the task with his usual calm and appeared on competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while judges perplexedly looked back and shrugged, audacious Meuse put from the original souvenirs/gift the illuminated by the size and finished his speech in the name of the project by the following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here is my proposal: &quot;The book mountain&quot; in Spijkenisse, so-called Bukenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, this mountain worth 30 million euros grew. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a project of revitalization, which includes underground garage, the supermarket, mail and houses some adjoining to them and apartments for a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November &quot;The book mountain&quot; was noted by the second prize of the competition &quot;The Best Library of the Netherlands of 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The plan also participates in national Dutch competition of wooden buildings of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless suburb that could not offer at nothing but a postmodern pedestrian area and surprisingly ugly town hall, which white facades suggested the milk factory, got richer in a modern work of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But the most important In Spijkenisse was the public building of cultural first in the history of this small town. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> Long road to the book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: book Eldorado under the cap for cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Just one elevator held in the center of the store, because the true worshippers of architecture and reading will prefer to explore the area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The room glazed from all sides - light and easily foreseeable, floors from bricks and elegant street lights umistakably create a sense of public city square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is recreated perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The look consiously seeks benches, dogs and boys playing football and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere, books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually bookcases stand along facades, and in the middle of this large dark room, usually uncomfortable and impersonal&quot; is located, says Blame the Meuse. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We put a classic configuration of space upside down and pulled the zone to read from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The inner space of the book mountain is used wisely: In the centre offices, Internet library, chess Club, an environmental center and technical rooms located. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Especially please black bookcases that serve as decoration of walls, parapets and a staircase railing. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their look, texture and smell are extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even experienced architects and civil engineers know it is for an unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We have to work with secondary materials&quot; - Jop Trauborst, project manager of the community of Spijkenisse, according to regulatory requirements explains. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Once at one agricultural enterprise in Frislandiya we met a suitable byproduct of agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Already there are many years in greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots artificial fiber material of millimeter thick attached. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It cheaply and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The delicate textiles serve out a couple of seasons after that, it might be thrown out. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For library this painting - for the first time in such amounts - was pressed into panel four inches thick. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into a dark, single, strong material on a smell a little like new car and a bit sneaker. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> On top conduct 105 steps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> The one who will overcome the way almost 500 meters long, will be rewarded in literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquets and wood ficuses in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere, and above all the right humidity on the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> The costs of the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It is hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology&quot;, says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For its heating and cooling warmth of the earth is used. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> While the book mountain standing under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a while. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Wide farms from the glued wood, located across the glass facade, give a shadow and take most of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Climate indoors the very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Other protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon mentioned above skeptic, from the field, have already visited new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lizette Verkhayg also was already here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And teachers of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg &quot;the soul of Spijkenisse, which lacked long ago&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Reason: A few weeks before the opening each resident received an invitation to offer one book from their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books had to be empty slots on the shelves not yet complete library, at that time there were 70.000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Shelves are crammed up to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than thin library&quot; - the architect Vini says Meuse. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think thanks to our invitation now every resident somewhat related to this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it was intended only for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem in professional jargon is called identity creation. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote a literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And even if they are very young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is just the starting point for the creation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Sabot: &quot;The Germans should play an important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany had abstained from voting on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Sabo, the communications expert between US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic path. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany first clear that it would vote against the application of the Palestinians for observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then Berlin abstained from voting. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support the action of Israelis in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the US position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to show their independence - without speaking too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had abstained from voting on the introduction of a prohibited area for flights. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> As a result of NATO carried out the proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on difficult international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The fact is that it was in the process of transformation of the foreign policy, namely passes from politics, so to speak, that the US, in fact, German foreign policy manageable. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In addition, the situation is compounded by the Europeans have no agreed-upon uniform policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans once again be between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> One is expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that while they just feel my role, but are on their way to &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> To such foreign policy that carried out by France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What the &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German view specifically mean? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is the willingness to take the position that does not depend on the position of the United States and the European partners in the national interest. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, which is on exports and communications with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Economic interests of Germany differs significantly from those of other large states and Germany has to defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> If the economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has major export markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> She therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Either way, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not take it too much, it is not completely one-way communications. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But either way, it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Whether Germany to a relationship with the US has much harm, refrain from making important decisions, such as vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I don&apos;t think it was the same dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Maybe Germany will even gain some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that will have to reckon with its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States, by contrast, clearly supported the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there a divergence of views between the United States and many European states? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of the American domestic politics these differences was always there. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration at the heart has sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But in connection with the local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly take this position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that significant differences of opinion are not so great at all, as it is always represented. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you believe the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu will notice that Obama Netanyahu not so enthusiastic about politics. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy for Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think it makes the situation is difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans it would be a bit easier if there was a single, coherent European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot act in a broader approach and are forced to work instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That&apos;s how they deal with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in the development of the European Common position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that for Germany it is difficult, if only because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This subject has always been sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think the Germans is clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - whether it will take a lead role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or the leading role hard is given to Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany has not yet accustomed to it, it is always bad to him and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard is allowed to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time Germany suggests an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings are shown. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It is not easy to Germans to deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is an old problem: You don&apos;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this perspective, Germany is a much worse situation than the US. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinion, and it is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> So, America&apos;s influence in European politics constantly weakens, but at the moment the EU does not fill the vacuum, who then remains? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans would just have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you don&apos;t like it, unpleasant or increases nelyubov for you, such is life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Sabo, the deputy director of Transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute at which academics and experts-political scientists from Europe and North America jointly investigate the problems of transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, the Sabot is a member of the German Marshall Fund, which specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and the transatlantic relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protect trademarks&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what is the Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> The name entirely legally registered in China, which has nothing to do with companies from which names is formed. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names will not make the claim. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But then it is unclear whether he will be able to defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners has become more difficult to protect the trademarks in China&quot;, Thomas Pattlokh, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing company specializing in violations of the rights to trademarks in the Far East says. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week appears on new business. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Suffice it to simulators to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So, from Gucci Lu-Gucci turns out, rather than Prada Prada-Kny can register. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way the German companies, such as the producer of sporting goods of Puma are legally copied. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattlokh opens the folder with records of the Department of trademark registrations in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered there Zegna DF Puma trademark, artificial name in which the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna is also used. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That Chinese - world champions in copying and violation of intellectual property rights, is known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In big cities have multistorey department stores selling almost exclusively fakes. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> But put Pattlokh not so. At the request of the principals he acts against Chinese enterprises absolutely officially gained the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere from the Department of trademark registration. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Chinese call it &quot;Banna минпай&quot; brand passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is associated with &quot;Banna дакуань&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> What they call women who hunt for the rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The Chinese authorities do not recognize guilt </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It affects business it is necessary to fight it&quot; - Pattlokh is convinced. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The trademark is washed away, a unique position is lost, image suffered tremendously&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in affected areas are priced in millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the company at CLSA market research, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third in size and the fastest growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But it is hard to achieve removal of questionable entries in the register of trademarks, and it is costly. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattlokh tells of cases in which the court rejected claims as after a long time, the protested name became &quot;the reality of the market&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If a claimant does not carry, he even they will have to pay the plagiarist as damage to his trademark in China, Pattlokh says. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes it corrects the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There are also well known cases of graphical elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, the Daimler company lost litigation with the manufacturer of construction Sany cars, a company that shortly before that got the manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo similar to a star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> A Geely company, which has bought Volvo initially used the blue-white logo recalling BMW; The process has been successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The manufacturer of fashion products of Lacoste lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, in which the famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities would not read pleaded guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Department of the registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 due to a lack of staff and premises to be so there was difficulty place. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But last year &quot;The return of the emergency situation in workflow to normalcy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of raw cases of objections fell by 22 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57.000 such cases were closed, is 75 per cent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> It is worth fighting is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As it is very often in China, are impressive figures. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year in CTMO more than 1.4 million statements to protect trademarks arrived, roughly one-third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> It is a record and means that China in the tenth consecutive time led the list of new design around the world, reports the department. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 it was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If you simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> It is worth protesters it many times as many shows business of the German family business Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the concern is fighting against the Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans have managed to ensure that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts by was eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But the simulator secured Chinese rights to Freudenberg brand. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was their own omission as the names in Germany are not protected, Hanno Venttsler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich said. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And the Department of trademark registrations of CTMO rejected the claim of Munichites. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both following instances of Freudenberg won, but the other side continues the fight so far. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> It is necessary to be on the alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The question now is examined by the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Venttsler hopes to carry it on good end and praise the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and away from us a lot of time, money, and nerves&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Domestic spending is unlikely to give in to the account, the archive of the company had to see even acts of a century ago to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago Freudenberg without results suggested the other side &quot;a large six-digit access amount in euros&quot; for a settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;This makes it clear as it to us is expensive&quot; - Venttsler says. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten to be thrown even Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If imitators register there themselves. un-championed trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The concern long stopped production in these areas, but despite that could prevent registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;It is necessary to be on the alert&quot; - Venttsler says. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> As it, and his lawyer Pattlokh recommend German companies to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international laws to protect trademarks, relatively foreigners are followed &quot;by all that somehow it is worth protecting, recording in China&quot; - Venttsler says. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it could cost much more expensive than registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the brand will have to pay for the other side license fees for their own name, Venttsler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise we will force out of the market in the disputed segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day: to foot tap, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In Heidelberg preparing chorus of Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> History of the relationship distance over 8733 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First the pritopyvaniye is distributed: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies&apos; boats and male papuce select a step on the parquet floor and quickly find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> Raz-dva-tri-chetyre. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Only after that the voices of singers, viola, Bass slowly increase, tenor and soprano - they come, charm and follow each other. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost does not jump out of the shoes made of canvas when leads them flexible and expressive gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The evening of Monday, in the music hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg chorus of Imbongi preparing a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty parties to the choir has come to rehearsal from 23 to 69, from an expert on the genetics of a person to Porter. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> Obani&apos;s &quot;min-amen-kamutef&quot; &quot;is a complicated thing, every voice of the choir has the text, in addition to a foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Help for their self-help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations programme to Fight AIDS, in the world about 34 million people living with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland lives 245 000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> With more than 40 per cent of the population of HIV-are positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in Esitzheni&apos;s village abcny votes for Africa found chiefs in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend school in preparation for further study. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month it is conceivable patronage. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This ensures the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot meal in the Gogo-center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Имбонги in the Zulu language the story or the eulogist means. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this room don&apos;t speak freely on the bow, but are able to sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Nearly ten years choir learn songs in this foreign soft language and at times even brings them back to where they first emerged: on the South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Esitzheni that depends on the voices of German chorus. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent are infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> There are about 2,000 people some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among people there are a lot of children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died of viral ICh. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The disease of all Swaziland is reflected in Esitzheni in miniature: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest in the world life expectancy according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Male circumcision, which was founded reduces the risk of infection 50%, among the population is not accepted almost. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland carry in a immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth ten is not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The choir opened the village on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005, but before Imbogni&apos;s participants saw a lot of kids in the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but also just a total of food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without schooling a man in a poor country has no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was a private commitment of individuals - for a few euros a year to send your child to school and to allow it once a day to get hot food. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But already a year later chorus based abcny &quot;votes for Africa&quot; that almost professionally concerns since then, of AIDS orphans in Esitzheni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What major sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> To bacterial STD carry syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent virus STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The pubic lice and itching, belong to parasitic STDs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The main struck groups? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea meet mostly by men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Robert Koch&apos;s institute acknowledges that a minimum in four of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transfer results from sex between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> At heterosexual adults the most common sexually transmitted diseases chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in us relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are part of this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people chlamydial infections occur much more often than among other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to the European data, three-quarters of all infections strike young people from 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> We among young people human papilloma virus also popular. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How the cases of infection change? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsory registration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Incidence of syphilis, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections since 2007 is shrinking. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011 there were about 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about on the one tenth is less than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms indicate a venereal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> At the infectious diseases there can be ulcers in the genitals, complaints in the urination, highlights, pain in the bottom of the stomach and bubbles or consolidations. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to be protected? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms are able to reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide absolute protection. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> After all, partially causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can spread by contact infection and in close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> So experts recommend regular monitoring, especially at the frequent changes of sexual partners. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> In the early diagnosis can cure the majority of STIs and avoid the long-term consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Patronat, donations and not least fees for performances of chorus across Germany allowed to collect something. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We sent to Esitzheni already about 200,000 euros&quot; tells Annetta Lennartts, chairman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> In the village from Germany Tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman manages money. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> She also cares that orphans were well organized, such as one of nature. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Гогос as call Zulu old women, it is a village support. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them come to themselves to 14 orphans, give them shelter and care that children in the form of every day in appeared at lessons. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Those who did not go native, arrive at an orphanage to Haniysila, a lonely woman who is paid salaries from the association, as well as two chefs who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Furthermore, the association &quot;votes for Africa&quot; organized sewing school, built two Hyun homes and together with the American Association for Health Care for PSI organized analysis delivery on HIV for many residents of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> It is hard to imagine, but about a disease that is so evident in the country, prefer to be silent deeply. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> The king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is absolute taboo&quot;, said Annetta Lennartts - &quot;because it is associated with sexuality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual in a country where King officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy over democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> In particular, to a lifestyle authorized by the state the fault that virus ICh so spread rapidly in recent years and lies. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But it is also on stray workers who carry the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms are literally at every turn, says Annetta Lennartts, &quot;but they don&apos;t use. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> Other culture, the flesh to flesh &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A little to support cultural exchanges, Ibmogni&apos;s chorus every two to three years is a trip to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, morale, confidence and black consciousness that many in the south country in the black continent know since apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus full white, which is sung by songs in black language - such recognition not only put a good mood and joy, but even, sometimes caused tears in the face of severe border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trip brings into Esitzheni where singers visit sponsored children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although the village can hardly be found on the map in the Valley of the river Etsulveni it is more than known. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> &quot;Go to Esitzheni, light&quot; - local people say. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg when chased singers come back to the rehearsal hall Bergkhaymer Street, you can see that light burns as well here. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that on the planet Mercury is ice. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice sheets can have thick 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Space Department of NASA proved ice availability on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although it is located close to the Sun, there also has a frozen water according to three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe &quot;Messenger&quot; found evidence that region of the planet continually in the shade is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Its thickness is expected to be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Allegedly, water comes from a comet or perhaps the asteroid, faced Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one connects ice discoveries with the existence of life on the planet, the adviser of the probe Sean Solomon said. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> But these findings could help explain how water and other building elements of life has got to other parts of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Enough to inhabitants of Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example &quot;Phoenix&quot; and explore the depths of the universe. </seg>

<seg id="1819"> The picture released by the European Southern observatory shows featuring several thousand light years a nebula Trifid in constellation of a lead. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, growing) as dark strips of dust share a warm heart of the cradle of stars into three parts. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our views in the Universe: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Perhaps the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - before Galileo Galilei began one year watching the stars later. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, mirrors of optical telescopes became increasingly - and spaces available to their look getting deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope to &quot;Hal&quot; it&apos;s Palomar in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror represented here, had a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the US, &quot;The big binocular telescope&quot; is installed. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows to look into space through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> &quot;Gran Telescopio Canarias&quot; has the huge internal device - the diameter of only the mirrors is 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of &quot;A big South African telescope&quot; in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of depreciation. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> However, in diameter, it comes to eleven meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The lack of an inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fastened under a vertical corner is limits his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The telescope &quot;Hobbi-Eberli&quot; in Texas also has a fixed vertical corner. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> The feature: high light gathering ability. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> It reaches - despite a relatively small diameter of a mirror - options of the world&apos;s largest telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>

<seg id="1853"> There is &quot;a very large telescope&quot; fully consistent with the name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> His four mirrors allowed to shine in a telescope even average infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The Chilean astronomico of ESO installation European &quot;a very large telescope&quot; is also planned. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror would have to be lengthened on the whole 42 meters - and will be made of nearly 1,000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> But photographs can be expected not before 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007 both telescopes &quot;Kek&quot; on he Kea&apos;s Hawaiian volcano was considered the world&apos;s largest. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> In two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters are set. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Telescopes &quot;Kek&quot; are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea, which, along with them is looking in the sky also through &quot;Subaru&quot; and IRTTF telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> In addition, Mauna Kea there should be a new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Here they can admire illustrations. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the most important views from space are supplied by the Space Telescope &quot;Hubble&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since April 24, 1990 it oversupplies pictures of the distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the space telescope &quot;Kepler&quot; looking for planets outside the solar system - first of all such where life is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the mission began. </seg>

<seg id="1869"> The main mirror of infrared space telescope has 10-meter-diameter 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the problems of the telescope: It must all over the world the first stars and galaxies to look for the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists think that in the South Pole of Mercury there is an ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> But reliable data on it are not present as &quot;Messenger&quot; moves closer to the North Pole planets. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements for decades, said that on Mercury there is an ice. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the probe began in 2004 &quot;Messenger&quot; - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists are confident now. </seg>

<seg id="1883"> A mini-bus carrying goula slides on the winding road, by the hills, overgrown with thick forests, crude streams and simple villas. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is so green and bright that it is possible to think that you are in black forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But it is the most southern province of Azerbaijan, Iran&apos;s border is just a few kilometers away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Live Here talishs is one of the people of the Caucasus known little, except that they are perfectly speak Farsi and azerbayzhdansky and different longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Destination is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> A small town boasts too heavy architecture of the Soviet era that is not in harmony in any way with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists from Europe do not come almost here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> On 323 kilometers eight hours as the road has only one strip leave. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The legendary wealth through the country is obliged to oil the Caspian Sea, here in the province, did not reach. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is sure to eat than interest tourists in Lerike. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;In May of Baku was famous for the festival song Eurovision - and next year we had the festival of the oldest person in the world&quot; will take place, Fatulayeva says. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is a director of museum of longevity is probably the only thing in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here&apos;s a biography about eight dozen talyshy of these places, which is documented more than 100 years. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, to him here 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years he has given birth to another child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov who 168 years were allegedly carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth certificates, however, are not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given that the oldest man whose age is documented, 122 years old, Myuslyumov&apos;s age seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973&quot; - Fatulayeva explains. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years at his daughter had been born. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Whether the shepherd Myuslyumov so added a couple of decades to the age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Even Rembrandt Sholts, a researcher in the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about long-livers in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;A lot older people can be found in some parts of China, Japan or Hunz&apos;s valley in Pakistan&quot; - Sholts says &quot;in Sardinia and there are so many very old people&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> But due to the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible because there were no lists of the civil status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day glass of drawn butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> There is a fact that people around Lerik Strikingly often achieve biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Now here lives 20 people 100 years older. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here in the south, there are a lot of long-livers? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The azerbaijanian guide Fareed Mugimzade explains it with specific genes talyshy. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> The director of museum Fatulayeva, by contrast, believes that matter in food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talysha love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink on a glass of drawn butter every day. But it is hardly likely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy in nutritional point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or it is a primitive way of life, which has up to people young? In Chengemirana, the tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzoyev. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In 97 years it is still relatively young for this area. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva who claim that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with the oil dulo which tirelessly rolls back and forth. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and Mirzayeva&apos;s daughter, who already have long had grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> The nearby two kids jump. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen for visitors prepare tea, served at typical pot-bellied Armudu glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Mirzayeva has perfectly equal and strong white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long chestnut-colored CEP her son with pride opens before us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always wash hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;And I never used shampoo&quot; - Mirzayeva says. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension enough for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only that grew up in their own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For all my life I never bought products in store. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband who served in the Army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was difficult after World War II. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it was better when &quot;the beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda occurs frequently in a speech on the old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult formed around the figure of Father of the nation that had ruled the country as an autocrat in Azerbaijan is knows no borders. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> It was in power until 2003, then the reins of government were adopted by his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Yet among the azerbaijanian old men there is no poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> (About equally same amount of the euro) Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly as pension, to local conditions is the sum for whom it is possible to live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, long ago Mirzayeva&apos;s grown son right: &quot;Old men in our culture are held in deep respect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a large family, are loved, surrounded by the care and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Than no reason to survive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is missing in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Revolution returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival demonstrations in Cairo show deep divisions of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Future constitution based on Sharia, met with fierce rebuffed. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Egyptian president did not be stingy with pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We must create transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And its success is on my responsibility to the people and before god&quot;, he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all people, but above all Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened mohammedans and secular Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> After all, all of them who still have been hopelessly divided in confused opposition, feel fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of a religious state in the Nile at the mercy of powerful &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi, without apologizing almost, said he temporarily cut off the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence &quot;to save the revolution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But, in fact, the 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. at American University of Southern California wants to rescue, is not entirely clear to Egyptians and the world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Whether the judiciary will be left without power? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact 234 articles have been brought into the night 15-hour gallop with obstacles in the Islamic custom constitutional assembly from 100 participants, and this is partly raises fears. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings rely on &quot;the principles of Islamic law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does it mean &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It has been and remains interpretation business, and it is possible to fear that Islamists would use the vague wording arising in connection with the legal люфт for stricter interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At least one newly introduced article hints at him: in all cases of Sharia, needs to attract Al-Azhar University, the most important Islamic establishment of the country with great authority on all Sunni Islam for the council. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It should not, but may mean that the clergy oversees behind legislation that is de facto would have resulted in limiting the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> In the draft constitution a lot of things are subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to military court should remain. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Those courts during Mubarak&apos;s power to serve the suppression of political opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the ouster of dictator in the military prison have 11.000 civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as indicated in the project, the state should protect &quot;nature of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;to support its morals and values&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally it is formulated imprecisely that public institutions with this article will be able to control even the content of film and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> In clear it means nothing more than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> No article does not create directly equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But another banned to insult and discredit the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But that such an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Doubtful the direction that &quot;the insult people&quot; non-smoking is presented. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> There will be caricatures of the president or joke about his jurisconsult enough? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The matter of interpretation, like a lot of things, he said, will be introduced soon &quot;in this project, which Morsi offers for a signature, and which Egyptians in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;Revolution returned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> A few weeks, the opposition against the superiority of Islamists is formed. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands gathered in unusual unanimity in Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it will be able to enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;Revolution returned, and we will win&quot; - Hamdin Sabbakhi who took third place on the presidential election said. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international department atomicenergy Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution the place &quot;in the dustbin of history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On the service of short news Twitter he accused Morsi&apos;s supporters of desire to head &quot;coup against democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he announced a referendum, we will go to the palace and we will throw it off&quot;, the opposition member Yasser Said said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We were not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not retaliated yuet&quot;, cited the Egyptian media of the opposition politician Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Many judges also said they do not want to see the referendum, which would make it invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Well organized &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot; in turn, called for opposite demonstration, but from precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before Cairo university. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> A large number of women took part in it under coats and advocates of Salafis who shouted: &quot;The people demand God&apos;s application of the law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> They demanded that Morsi: &quot;Clear the country. &quot;also assured: &quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all started, provoked a state of almost civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Morsi&apos;s followers, clearly, didn&apos;t want to take this risk. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot; said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Is now time to allow people to solve time at the ballot box in which direction the country should go. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Most of the project of Islamists, is considered it a done deal. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;The concept&quot; human rights &quot;not mentioned never&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1991"> Not because he shared their outlook, but because human rights for it are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> He was beaten, sentenced, arrested for it. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> And now the words &quot;human rights&quot; never met in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The expansion of the impact of Morsi on all three branches of government disappoints, a lawyer in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are a clear blow to democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;Instead of strengthening civil state, the de facto president cancelled&quot; - Sayeda regrets. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Because without civil society organizations democracy cannot function. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Sayeda feels that all abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with curiosity and Strain mixture. </seg>

<seg id="2006"> Leave them there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> You have the smell of rakfisk vivid sense of smell is one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies will succeed. </seg>

<seg id="2013"> All around us people eat fish cut in small dice and wash her down with significant portions of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Like аквавит than rakfisk more&quot; - Havard says. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> This drink is able to break their smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a couple of slices. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If this can be by a piece near by, it&apos;s not so bad - a little different from a spot of land you long carried with you on the bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the Norwegian product from different times, poverty times when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish presoaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water in the fall. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then in the deep winter when fish now well and thoroughly began to ferment, her took and, having muffled perception alcohol, used in food. </seg>

<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, indispensable if somewhat foul-smelling element of the past of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is one of the most expensive local dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> On the other hand, this is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars). </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most people in the country, it seems, is happy with this. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> People here remain reluctant to mention Anders Breivik&apos;s name, racist and extremist right-wing, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Without mentioning his name, act of terrorism call &quot;happened on July 22&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> At the heart of today&apos;s well-being of Norway growth (since the early Seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world is lying. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity&quot;, Anna, our waitress carrying trays with adult rakfisk, a woman with his long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes says, the embodiment of Nordic well-being. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are people like you call it is reasonable. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Like most Norwegians, she is fluent English. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We don&apos;t like being being displayed, we are not capery. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway very carefully so oil - most of its profits from oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> In the years before the global financial crisis when all squandered money that they did not, Norway is thrifty counted all costs. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;While it is possible to ski in winter and to go camping in the summer, this is enough to happiness&quot;, Anna said. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;There is also a rakfisk&quot;, she adds with the carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I stand in the snow in the queue behind any food - rakfisk I have had enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Here&apos;s a hamburger with losiny meat is exactly exotic, deliciously juicy meat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the evening we wait for more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> In my hotel perform a special dinner on rakfisk during which visitors set by a vote, the best, or perhaps the most fragrant fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a direct air in that show a leader in the tie butterfly, surrounded by plates with rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It&apos;s like a song contest &quot;Eurovision&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;So the Thor Jürgen that mark you have given for the best fish there at yourself in the mountains?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Yes, Havard, here is our assessment&quot;.... </seg>
<seg id="2047"> All laugh and applaud. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Someone falls from his chair, possibly having touched аквавита. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe just breathed the smell of the fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The hard early career is necessary to Mexican President Enrique Peña Ñeto. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Ñeto is going to take office, the BBC correspondent extend invites us to look at the difficulties that would face, and a mixed expectations of the population of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Trafficking in Mexico City now in particularly woeful. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> This city is overloaded with transport and the best time, since Monday steel obstacles cutting some key highways to the capital and causing chaos on roads were built. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But it was not to keep people to get to work from suburban areas and to prevent protesters to get to the parliament building. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Sunday the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Ñeto will put on a presidential line and will take the helm of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> She faces a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has made good economic data from Felipe Calderon&apos;s administration, which now puts the powers, but the country mired in war on drugs, which in six years has already claimed some 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government claims to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence&quot;, Mr. Peña Nieto said earlier this week, US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White house. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to propose new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> To such statements in the US president political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> On his homeland, in a densely populated and extensive staff around the capital of the country, views on the new head were shared. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Straightforward person </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the idyllic small town Valye-de-Bravo, for example, it fondly remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> People put it down to credit tourism revival, the development of the resort area and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> You can reach the city on one of the new roads built by g-ohm of Peña Nieto, which are very different from roads with holes and holes previously on this place. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Plates with his name hang on a modern building of the sports centre and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We take from it the hopes of real and serious changes&quot;, the friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, congressman of the state from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Peña Nieto said. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We expect a real and drastic changes that are so badly needed for our country, particularly in the area of security and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera recognizes that after he was 12 years of absence in the presidential Los-Pinos palace the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Ñeto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> In addition, he dismissed the accusations of triviality that were brought to the new president by the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It is very straightforward and very dedicated to the cause of the embodiment of his vision of the future of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is a great statesman, and, above all, the person able to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But the rest of the state many people had another idea of the former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Belediye Nesaualkoyotl, also known as the name of Syyudad-Nes, is the clearest contrast with cobbled streets of Valye-de-Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden beneath the platforms of highways, in many ways, it&apos;s the outskirts of the Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And problems in the municipality also have severe nature of this metropolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year to suppress the gangs trafficked in drugs in those areas, troops attracted; and the violence against women has here is particularly acuity. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On the wasteland near an extensive dump only dozens of bodies of the murdered women in the past two years have been identified. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto is far higher than the equivalent figure in the city of Ciudad Juárez, which has sadly become famous for violence whose name is nominal when it comes to the killing of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, of him at best we can say that during his time as governor he failed to address the problem of femicide. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, his administration was accused of complete disregard of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> A resident of the concrete house similar to a lot of homes in the stalled area irenaeus Buendiya barely holding back tears, showing me photos of the late daughter Mariana Long. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version Mariana in 2010, committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family will read that she had been murdered by her concubine. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I got her home, was like that, her body before it washed&quot;, Ms. Buendiya recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that he had been beaten, and a body had already frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Mariana&apos;s mother retells the story, and a portrait of his daughter looks at us from the wall where it hangs near the crucifixion on which only one word can be seen: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> This, according to them, this was refused to this family. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot;Officials treated me like the old gossip unhappy with the violator of calm. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want people just took believe everything they say, and kept tight-lipped. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But it is wrong, so it is impossible, especially when there are a lot of violations and defects &quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> By putting on a presidential line Saturday, President Peña Nieto with it will take hard responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico mentioned the crimes of violence, and the new president promised to make the problem, priority during his rule. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that he would be exactly the same president what was the governor&quot; - Olvera, a congressman from Valye-de-Bravo PRI says. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But the family of victims in Syyudad-Nes are most afraid of it. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse, said charge. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors try to refute Bradley Manning&apos;s allegations of poor conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> During the hearing highlighted Manning&apos;s stay in the military prison at Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of the conclusion of Manning were brutal. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The private of the US military accused of stealing thousands of classified documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that the private Bradley Manning accused of the largest leak of secret material in US history, did not use a lot of opportunities to make a complaint of abuse, which he said, he happened to transfer, while in military prison. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During cross-examination in pretrial hearing in Fort Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maryland, the military prosecutor major Eshden feign said records of weekly visits to Manning by representatives of the administration of prison in nine months of his detention at Quantico, Va., do not contain complaints of abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Cross-examination in considering the request of the defence for diversion of Manning that his conditions of confinement were cruel and were themselves in sufficient punishment, was carried out the day after Manning said that while in detention, he intended to commit suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The military specialist in the analysis of intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> They were subsequently published on the Internet site WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> The WikiLeaks website has not confirmed that Manning was the source of information. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During the hearing on Friday, prosecutor feign with Manning saw reports that had filled in after Manning&apos;s visits by the representatives of the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was on the terms of a high security of the conclusion from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> During visits serving prisons asked Manning questions and recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When the prosecutor feign asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that estimates the contact from prison service &quot;excellent&quot; and the general conditions of detention &quot;very professionally organized&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The reports do not contain any complaints of abuse, despite the fact that Manning explicitly asked about the conditions of his detention, feign claims. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he expressed oral concern about these problems and that officials visiting it discussed with him these problems and said that they will do, but did not fix it in writing. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They recorded&quot; problems are missing &quot;(after discussing my complaints) but it does not mean that I didn&apos;t raise the subject in a conversation&quot;, Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> A military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked Manning why that did not complain of illegal treatment in January 2011 during the meeting of the commission considering suicide intentions that it made in writing for a few months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that it removed the regime of &quot;injury prevention&quot; and relaxed conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited mode of concluded-on is one level lower than the supervision regime for the purpose of suicide prevention, was introduced to protect the prisoner, and for the sake of the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to clear administrations that with me all right that they cancelled an injury prevention regime... The level of my life improved, from my point of view &quot;, Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> On Thursday, Manning testified to the arrest in Iraq and moved to Kuwait, where nearly two months before transferred to prison on naval base in Quantico, Va., in July 2010 supported him. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that the thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he fainted because of the intense heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He explained that is psychologically very tough when you don&apos;t clear how your fate is decided, and what is happening in the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot;My world shrank to base Camp-Arifzhan, the size of my prison, Manning said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in this cell &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> In Quantico, Manning, according to him, spent much time in a small cell, at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - all alone. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, bedroom-slippers, some articles of clothing and points. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He said that tried to move, and how to sleep or even simply lie in the afternoon banned rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> According to Manning, during sleep attention to it constantly was arrested by light permeative outside of the camera. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, according to him, he awoke and forced to turn over on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Advocaat Manning gave official objection against illegal treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011 Manning transferred to the military prison in Fort-Livenvort, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning on the statement he made during the testimony on Thursday, that after once at night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to face naked security guards and other prisoners in the morning test. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning said he had no opportunity to be covered with a blanket in check. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> In response to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the guard, which should throw a blanket with which it could be covered, but acknowledged that no one did not directly order him to throw it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning said last night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that it does not threaten. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning reported that said the officer that they could use an elastic band of cowards or bedroom-slippers to hurt himself, but did not do so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, under Manning&apos;s testimony, his underwear, bedroom-slippers and glasses, was taken from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge, at least to consider that he had to worry while in detention, and will significantly reduce the sentence if Manning is convicted by military court, which is expected to begin consideration of its business in the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Protection said that plans to offer Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes, and to challenge other charges as excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The resumption of hearing is scheduled for this weekend, it is anticipated that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon argues that Manning was detained in Quantico under the rules governing the content of those arrested with the highest security. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the charges against Manning, the illegal promotion of publication of data on the Internet, the information on national defense, and kidnappings of state assets or documents are registered relating to aiding the enemy. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If convicted on all counts in the indictment, life imprisonment could threaten it. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the Mexican American. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities to use themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of the country of hard times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> In a recent trip to Mexico City I passed along a corridor for the coming approached the zone of border controls and cold. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two rounds: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), one for Extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I faced a few seconds, without knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and me all my life called Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is just a code name as well as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later I stopped on a design &quot;Mexican American&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here in the land of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex ideas. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just us. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak to ask quite well Spanish questions or to answer them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary is poorer than when native-speakers, and I can&apos;t get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I got the American passport and got in line for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered the story a few days ago, when newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Ñeto visited the White house and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Questions were on the agenda familiar for meetings of the two presidents: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The president Peña Nieto eagerly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, through which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico rather than moving to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign the treaty on partnership with the US and Canada, and to create some North American trade block like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the president Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals did not sound. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico relations with the United States, a subject that was heavy and made of old scores. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never reflected that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun of rifles forced its leaders to give up half of the territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans think centuries rather than minutes and see reminders of what happened in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So any statesman of the US needs to mention, although criticism word toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society complaints that Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbors are immediately distributed. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And Montezuma&apos;s descendants are filled with militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The relationship of Mexico with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the US is the most difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about offenses? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> It is enough of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for itself opportunities, and for whom this opportunity is not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio has a lot of people of Mexican origin for one reason only: At some point, their family history someone - a father or grandfather - was unable to find itself in Mexico and was forced to go to the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Most of them were Mexicans a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from poor rural families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, see differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and got a good job, but we cannot forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination is confused, and is not clear, but we know what country to read. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> We also know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elites and the ruling class don&apos;t like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We answer them with the same. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as people of the second grade as artificial Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We do not adequately speak Spanish, and our ties with Mexico not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our existence for them is explained by failures. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We would not find itself behind the silk curtains, finding in the US full life, but having lost spiritual touches. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US as a kid and it reminds me that between a real Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there are some tensions - Mexicans understand the national identity more clearly, and it is offensive to Mexican Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a U.S. citizen and believes that belongs to both of these countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, my many familiar Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Get the best of both worlds, you must lose roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico we are Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the US, they call us Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I discovered during the trip as if our relationship without that are very confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals, want to restore relations with diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want Mexican Americans worked as a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and presented its interest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell the American friends about what is a beautiful country and it&apos;s great to visit him, and could convince political leaders to forge closer ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> No way. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There are too many offences in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking binge, many of us don&apos;t believe that the country is so perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but deal with it, амигос. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And it is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If the part of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States as they arrived with Mexico a century and a half ago, they should take and the fact that some Mexican Americans still in offence for the way most recently in Mexico managed with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Maybe we have more common than it seemed to me. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles in the new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The Ceasefire Agreement between Israel and Hamas group can be a fragile foundation for further world </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Whether the long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East is possible? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The next round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sound, the increasingly familiar, meaningless disputes on the one who started the first; Many buildings are destroyed; More than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis were killed; for the first time during the conflict, released from the Gaza strip of the rocket fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> While the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in the eternal conflict, changes to the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> It is possible to treat it differently, but the events began to vortex generation &quot;Arab spring&quot; many settled realities in the lawless storm and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay out of the vortex that rocked the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> It is possible, as a result, their struggle even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons, venting hope for from the deadly impasse. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> War without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance the situation does not give reasons for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if a ceasefire, the agreement in which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, the clashes that have occurred this week only strengthened security officers from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Leaders of the Islamic Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will announce that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the losses suffered by them. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents are blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas increases the popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territories currently overseen by the more moderate Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> In the process of increasing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> A resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, acted with Hamas support; Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic Gulf states followed suit. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Triumphant Hamas supporters declare creation around Israel with an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon in the north, in which the militant Hezbollah group, to Syria in which more and more pro-Islamic rebels had vvozdavatvot overthrow Bashar Assad&apos;s power, and further to Jordan, where the authorities of the king threaten allies of Hamas rules. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the regional balance of power has been on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohammed Morsi movement influence the Muslim Brotherhood has become stronger. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator who was not paying special attention to the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is the organization in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic engagement of Hamas can be a significant player, whose voice will not be muted even to Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, supporters of the &quot;tough&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In a military sense of Hamas were crushed. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli anti-missile system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the missiles to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least any time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the US to remain faithful to its permanent position; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the final round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, particularly at the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that, since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by the rockets released from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall that comes through the West Bank - a significant part of the non-recognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements that continue expanding despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the elections scheduled for January 22 - teamed up with even more aggressive-minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What sense to give the Palestinians and give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> When given in their drive all the power in the West Bank, whether it from there will be launching rockets toward Israel as it is done by their counterparts in the Gaza Strip? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps supporters of the &quot;tough&quot; line will win; But their calculations could be challenged in the Arab spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Though Islamists who came to power in Egypt and other countries, not the most warm feelings for Israel, internal problems be their priority. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defensive part of the budget of Israel&apos;s more than in all its Arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments to strengthen their own economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who, together with Barack Obama worked on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, no less so, should consider long-term consequences of the policy. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> As we approach for democratic change in the Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinians in the right to self-determination is a ticking time bomb that will blow up sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus, which has blown up in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Repression has already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is growth of the Arab population is only exacerbate these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> For bloody operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip for Hamas suppression, it is necessary to pay in growing resentment of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need an external momentum </seg>
<seg id="2249"> There is the only solution to that sensible representatives from both sides, and much of the rest of the world and our newspaper continued challenge: The two countries and the concession Israel of territory in return for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, hope that the ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties involved more effectively. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt it is past time for them to make the decision to block arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have more than ever, better position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries also have to seek reconciliation of movements of Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would do more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming vote in the United Nations may result in recognition of virtual Palestinian statehood. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Its role in setting Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> In his first term, he did not submit its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White house it still shows a reluctance to connect to address the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> It is tragically short-sighted position. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States is a vital interest in stability in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> It is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia and the law on standardised packaging for cigarettes came into force. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings about the hazards of smoking and the image of body parts delivered to diseases contrastly are allocated on a sad green boxes apply equally to all the brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The Australian law first world practice on the same packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and colors the registration of different brands by the same box of sad and olive colour with terrible pictures of the body parts struck with the disease and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking their parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Besides different images and inscriptions warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the packs imposed mandatory starting this Saturday is the name of brands that were printed with the same small print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> These are the most severe in the world of a condition for registration of packaging for tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The federal government of Australia announced that the purpose of this measure, to keep young people from smoking, depriving the abuse of a fashionable status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis of the decision was formed by the results of studies that have shown that the people, not start to smoke to 26 years, in 99 out of 100 cases and never have become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is clear that even at the most young children understand the sense that tobacco companies through packaging registration&quot; try to inform, the minister of Health Tanya Plibersek explains, referring to the research that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo associated in children with the idea of the princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the proportion of smokers lowest in the world, so these changes will not particularly affect profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is considered already by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Representatives of the tobacco industry has resisted the new law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and accessible cigarettes will be sold. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The law will lead to serious consequences, other than that reflected his leaders&quot;, Scott Makintayr, a spokesman for British American Tobacco company in Australia said. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will deliver many more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For someone, by contrast, new laws encourage business growth. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that demand for cigarette cases and the silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on packaging, soared (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case before the high court in Australia, where tried to appeal against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra H, Zico company has already sold about six thousand products to businesses of wholesale and expects new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us it is good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, popularity of social networking among the part of the population of these measures are aimed. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the passage in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal advertising of cigarettes and support for sporting events, and which prohibit vendors to expose cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government banned local companies and websites to advertise on the Web, but it cannot limit it foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you trade in tobacco products and you have only a small opening, the idea to promote their goods on the Internet will look to be very tempting&quot;, Becky Friman exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney explains. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman notes the growing number of reviews for trademarks, ordinary users written by a person allegedly on such social networks, as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question is whether the work of the ordinary citizen who love Marlboro cigarettes that he did not regret the time and resources is valid and made the video, or unless there is an advertising company? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian office of British American Tobacco Company says in the industry are now more concerned with adaptation to new rules than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Representatives of the tobacco industry were even such measures as part of Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states made no claims in the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair to restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations to all those countries with Australia are very small. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The decision of the WTO is expected to the middle of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of their acceptance of such laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada, the first introduced mandatory placement of the photos warning about the hazards of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now the rule was adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The possibility of tougher laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> The number of smokers in Australia pointedly do not believe innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures don&apos;t touch me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just don&apos;t pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;You just pulling a cigarette and you hide a pack in your pocket&quot;, Victor El Jeyg buying cigarettes with a photo of a tumor in his mouth on the deck explains. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, the only thing that can make me throw is my little daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu managing a tobacco King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, argues that the same packaging compounded the problem of collusion of goods from shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;Earlier in my discharge of a new party hour, and now four hours left&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should take and totally to prohibit a cigarette, then we would say: what to do, all right, it&apos;s over, we are closing shop &quot;, he says, throwing up his hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Miss in the world of electronic networks and persistent connections so it&apos;s not too bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I suddenly had to spend five hours to this Thanksgiving at the airport because mechanical problems were found in our plane and it replaced by another plane that we and waited. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> So I have had enough time for reflection on boredom nature. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not deceive you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> In the afternoon at the airport waiting for the flight, it&apos;s really boring, and here is not much help neither books nor magazines, iPhone, even duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Recently, however, more and more scientists and experts in child development are in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It forces the brain to distract for interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And how we are constantly in the modern world in front of any screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We need to strive for boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And at the same time is not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We will return to it. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> I used to, like many others, believed that boredom is the invention of relatively recent times when people had more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> It is not is approved by Peter tuia, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University Calgary, author of the book &quot;Fascinating History of Boredom&quot; (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, the boredom can boast of very ancient history&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii Latin inscriptions about boredom, dated found the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> There is open the question of how we understand boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada that the understanding and boredom vision often changed. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having studied studies on the topic and asking a question to the task force in 100 people, the professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to this definition: Boredom is when people &quot;want, but can&apos;t deal with that would put them satisfaction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that the missing man does not do anything that would like to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> At opatija does not want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The basic in experienced boredom, he said, it &quot;violation of attention and the mood associated with this deterioration and a sense that time hangs heavy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> According to the description boredom may seem very similar to a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But the professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these countries, missing people see the problems in the world and circumstances, and the people during the depression, see the problems in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes it seems to us that it&apos;s boring to us when it is difficult for us to focus on anything. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> A study &quot;vacant reason: boredom definition in terms of attention &quot;published in September issue of the problems on Psychological Science journal, the professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the experiment had earlier which participants listened to record the voice reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants had also heard loud sounds of the irrelevant TV program included in the next room, others heard the same sound to lower the volume level, so they could be sorted, and the third group only listened to record the voice without foreign soundtrack. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who heard the TV with low volume, noted that he was bored, more than others, it was difficult for them to focus, but they didn&apos;t know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, Mark J. says. Fensk, associate professor of neurology at the University Gvelfa, Ontario, and a co-author of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we do something not interesting, &quot;for example, peering at the flow of products on the line in search of a marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is considered, he said that when people start rocking on a chair or to draw a churn out on a piece of paper, they do with boredom, however, we now know that actually doing so simply help not cool physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;The study found that children who aren&apos;t prohibit fidget and spin, learn better and more information than children from whom demand to sit quietly&quot; Remember, the professor Fenske claims. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> At some points, all of us test boredom: at a flight delay (as in my case) listening to the monotonous speech, viewing the uninteresting movie. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> However, different people show varying degrees of tendency to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s, researchers have developed to measure such specific features special &quot;The scale of tendency to boredom&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine an assessment on this scale questions and statements, for example, &quot;a lot of it are used that I should do, monotonous and monotonous&quot; or &quot;Too much is interesting to me, so nothing there is no time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The researchers determined by such surveys that boys miss more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of various external stimuli says. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But as a whole adolescents in general often miss. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991 Read Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, launched an experiment in which he had been in contact with the help of the messages with almost 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He received the following results: 32% jailbaits said he is bored at school and in the household chores and 23% said he is bored outside the school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> So only 3% of parents said that he was bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> The professor Larson noted that he had no information on what would be similar data on boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he knows that &quot;this is the share of adolescence, the peak of tendency to boredom&quot;, due mainly to children and adolescents do not address fully than to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Let&apos;s go back to my initial question: Boredom is helpful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in most extreme, this research shows that can push people to absurd and dangerous physical action, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers reflected on the relationship between boredom and creativity, the professor Vodanovich who has devoted to studying the issue of more than two decades, says. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brains tells us that we must do something different; It is also boredom &quot;, Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University said. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain doesn&apos;t always know what it is better to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If it is boring for you and you will direct this energy on playing the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you want to watch TV, it is better for you only for some time, and will pass soon. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is missing and you give him the iPad, it will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom independently or in any way otherwise to manage your time and employment, the professor Fenske says. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;And such skills of independent regulation are involved in a variety of situations&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to occupy themselves himself with something, he also studies self-control in general. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I don&apos;t think the boredom should be praised in some way. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But to read it out something bad is not necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> You have to learn to feel comfortable even out of the constant stream of activities and technology on. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> The professor Eastwood agrees with him. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see it so that we need to test more often boredom, and the boredom is an unpleasant, an unquenchable desire to do something meaningful&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to be disabled somehow of constant worries and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In the modern world we are accustomed to regular excessive stimulating senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when it is silent, we are lost and we don&apos;t know what to do&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is unclear as the new law on marijuana legalization in Colorado would apply </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, nineteen-year-old player of the football team and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado stands accused of committing a criminal offence that would be completely legitimate throughout the state soon: possession of a small amount of marijuana and tube in which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that once in September he with friends in Lamar and went in the car on the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After a police officer found marijuana in the car, to Mr. Orozco subpoena for drug possession and knowledge of adapting for drug use - small offences came, the penalty is due for each of which $100 - and date of the trial is ordered. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;With us are being treated as criminals&quot;, Mr. Orozco said. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But criminal? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of uncertainty that comes weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, addressing hundreds of small litigation depends less on the law, how many on the viewing area. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Allegations of a small offences related to marijuana, are already removed in hundreds of cases, here and in the State of Washington, which took a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have already stopped demonizing those aged 21 and older for possession of small doses that they would be considered legitimate once in a couple of weeks the law will come into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, more conservative areas of Colorado prosecutors decided to regard the current cases related to marijuana, and former hold for storage of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> However, in some cities from the outskirts of Denver to mountain regions of the West vote to allow the in their places in the new stores licensed by any state on marijuana sales. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All this is growing so quickly that I don&apos;t know what to expect further&quot;, Daniel J. says. Оутс, the chief of police in the little town of Aurora in the east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of the authorities in the State of Washington is also puzzled scratch their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They should make rules to determine the order of the licensing of growing, processing, distribution and marijuana sales, and all this must be made until December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, this is good or bad, promotes most other states in the settlement of the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado better market, so they will serve as a good example&quot; - Brian I. Smith, the representative of the council to regulate the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the State of Washington explains. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no one can do more, Mr. Smith recognizes than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent by which we can be guided&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The bill of the State of Washington called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and for the year will cast staff into a state of uncertainty when the system of state licensing yet, and the right of the possession of marijuana is legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between a state law about &quot;adequate access&quot; to the licensed marijuana from a ban on trade in it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It will be particularly difficult to place the licensed facilities for trade in marijuana within the cities, especially in Seattle and its suburbs&quot; - Ben Livingston, the representative of the newly formed research group &quot;Center of the legalization of marijuana&quot; explains. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the police chief of the Outs from Aurora sent to his subordinates by e-mail that the prosecutor&apos;s office of the city would not entail any more people who have reached the age of 21, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops, exposing people of these violations &quot;from this time&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief of the Outs reported that the police will enforce in the city of the rules governing persons, growing marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and distributors of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The prosecutor of the district Ueld in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, a more rigorous approach to this question. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on a bill he said that prosecutors will still be held accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage using her face to get medical treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> At the moment the charges of possession of two and less ounces of marijuana, although many of them charged and other violations are brought to 119 people. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The duty of our institution - to pursue for the actions that are considered criminal at the time of their commission&quot;, Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Reaction was mixed even in places like Mes&apos;s rural district, where voters was rejected the proposal on marijuana legalization. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police grand Dzhankshn, the largest city in the district, no longer hold adults to own a small number of drug. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The district attorney Pete Hauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss the charges on existing cases involving possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it will not change is our duty&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of residents of Colorado, which voted, supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reaction of people in different parts of the state naked ambiguity about local authorities to employees experiment with marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;District attorneys in this issue have a cultural barrier&quot; - Sean McAlister, the Denver attorney who represented the interests of convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National organization to reform laws on marijuana explains. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They long persecuted people for it that now cannot accept that it no longer a crime&quot;, he says so. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first states in which a small amounts of marijuana are in the same as cocaine, is destined to become a pilot field in country scale to verify the idea of legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Supporters of legalisation and officials plan to expand the territory of the legal trade, but at the same time, they cautiously wait for instructions from the federal government still plan to consider selling and marijuana cultivation as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Supporters of legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice department will give in on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite the arrests that have just received a broad resonance of dealers and their patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government in most cases, allowed trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Fight agents of the office on drugs would break it into their homes to seize a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the shops of recreational marijuana governed by the state government which are covered under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on issues of the fight against drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado didn&apos;t wait for the actions of the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The presidential election some local authorities approved a moratorium on opening new stores on marijuana sale and so could not open until a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, the city in the western part of staff, nominated a six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week for consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to be in a position that we will give someone a license and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level&quot;, Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council said. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our city voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now the contradiction is available here between the results of local vote and objects, for which the state voted. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are many other outstanding issues. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Uayett: me survivors from the Oxford that I am a conservative. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Persecution of university students for their views did not start today. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> How many I remember myself, I&apos;ve always wanted to go to Oxford University. </seg>

<seg id="2412"> Friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The Evening Standard newspaper argued that I threw college because it was not pleased that my fellow-members have sex in the next room. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The writer E. Normann Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from stab cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> In fact, it was not so funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, fled because they systematically poisoned and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> At all because of my rather unusual name or that I was in private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Me poisoned for one reason only, and in this glorified cradle of culture it looked a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Uayett, was the famous advisor Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of conservatives. </seg>

<seg id="2422"> This re-institutionalized and rising hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of the rights that is provided to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Conservatives in the student club of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge announce that they &quot;often actively isolate, subject to personal attacks and makes you feel like unwanted guests&quot; because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want to join the committee on equal rights of the College of the additional representative to ensure freedom of expression. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation was exacerbated by a documentary that has left recently on BBC 2 about politics in the student groups &quot;A wonderland: young, smart and right &quot;in that conservatives presented clowns and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Jo Cook, former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University who walk in Rolls-Royce was shown in the film, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> At other universities conservative students complain that they do &quot;scapegoats for raising tuition fees&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luc black, 20 years, vice president of the Association of conservatives of Nottingham university, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said &quot;in the university too great a focus on left increases. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People who don&apos;t even know us, believe us in advance audacious and with impunity violent children of rich parents &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history of Corpus Christi College, whom the application for better protection was submitted, calling such an atmosphere &quot;uncomfortable&quot; and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, said that the attitude of the members of the student club carriers of center-right views dramatically worsened. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;It is a threat to both the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, and it is easy to normal life of club members&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not simply to minorities, I was one. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I arrived in September 1986, a timid and shy 18 year old girl. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Oxford was in the fever with hatred of conservative party. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The year before the university vote stripped the former student, Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of reduced budgets for the higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> In such an atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the week of a first-year student when students meet each other and teachers, I felt for the first time that was waiting for me ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I didn&apos;t know what teachers not only made light of harassment of conservative students, but was also enjoying taking part in it. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political affairs - a strike by miners, privatization and the opposition of the government to impose sanctions against the apartheid government, got into South Africa through the walls of audiences sheathe by wooden panels. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for that followed. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Uayett, the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, &apos;Please said, translate the first paragraph&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The text was offering me difficulty, I faltered. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Harry Pitt was very choleric man with a man like a pie. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcherites fundamentally do not learn French or simply brains are not sufficient to them? &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Other students began to giggle. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I had tears in her eyes spoke. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I advise you to take some initial lessons of the French in their free time, if you are, of course, not very busy, mixing in society&quot;, Pitt complained. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned to the room of the very unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That evening in college I sat at dinner one; then someone patted me shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was James, a second-year student of the department of English, which was presented as a member of the Association of conservatives of the university. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are, he said friendly. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, the situation is as follows: </seg>
<seg id="2453"> With each suspected of supporting the Conservatives would be harassed. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is hard for me, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> The majority of conservative freshmen pretend that they are Labour &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to play the hypocrite. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that agrees with everything he says to Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> Cunning failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year student of the Faculty of philosophy, Politics and Economics who himself studied in Eton, said: &quot;You&apos;re the daughter of the fascist pig. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You contagious &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students picked up his words. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was spoiled, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;How conservatives have sex? asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They bang each other, right? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like, should be, gay before the repeal of criminal prosecution in the sixties felt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Or I have yet to meet supporters only under the cover of darkness? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> If I will be forced to become a labourite, and to hide the real faith? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Three years coming me began to seem hell full of persecution and loneliness. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only teacher in my college, a conservative views, Norman Stone, a professor of modern history was not hiding. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also that he was adviser Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speech writers. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In college he did not appear. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He despised it for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist deterministic view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he has taken a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> &quot;Here you will not be happy&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, sought refuge with relatives and impartial capital friends. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told the father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> She didn&apos;t believe me. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies in the 1940s any political minds, there were adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> &quot;But after all the same the best university in the world, he said plaintively. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> There of them are unable, not in the city of dozing spires... </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my communist friends always behaved perfectly-the &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> His moist eyes grew turbid. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> &quot;Don&apos;t take any hasty decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I&apos;m sure it&apos;s just jokes. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> You will break my heart, if you cast university &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> I was exhausted by permalinks to travel to London and my emotional protection weakened. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> My friend, also a Conservative, did not withstand the pressure and refused the faith. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> Next week at the seminar, when the next history teacher completely serious called me &quot;an enemy of the people&quot; I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In the soul being burnt with shame, I recognized that &quot;I was brainwashed over the coals by parents&quot; and called them &quot;the old fools&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was brief. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> My father was destined to hammer the final nail into the cover of the coffin of my career in Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time he wrote every week on two columns for the publications owned by Rupert Murdoch. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I didn&apos;t leave, and five minutes later, my persecutors gave up. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I didn&apos;t return. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Can call me a crybaby and rags. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But in eighteen years no one should be subject to such anger and intimidation in college. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> That is more sad that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, but also to this day is behind an unfair reputation of university, where value equality and free-thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> &quot;Valentino prefers elegancy to glory&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2554"> &quot;It was perfect, age does not exist for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is said by the princess... </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The heaviest profession in the world: miners from Kavakh-Idzhen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros Indonesian miners risking life and limb, dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur on volcano top on steep stony tracks </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work - hell, and others literally work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them Anto Vidzhaya, one of 400 miners who make a living from sulphur production in the volcano Kavakh-Idzhen located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day Anto descend into the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas rising from the depths of Earth, freezes at contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Having broken away vast stretches of sulphur total weight of which can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets and carries them up on a steep rocky road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> To the volcano upper height of 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but are required to emaciated loaders more than 40 minutes to get up at a snail&apos;s pace, barely keeping balance and carefully groping the road to stumbleth and fall over the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong move could cost them life as it happened to one tourist from France, which broke a few years ago from Kavakh-Idzhen&apos;s rocks. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners from Kavakh-Idzhen earn 5 euro for every kilogram of sulphur that extract </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Appearing above, they make their way through between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, three kilometres to scale the mining company set up a bit above, at the height of 1.850 metres out. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is a matter of PT Kandy of Ngrimbi, the company that manages since 1960 the volcano and better and not to say, workers to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro) for every kilogram of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro) to petrochemical industries, after all this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamit and even for sugar bleaching. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip&quot;, explains us Anto who usually carries out three daily carryings. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> It spends three hours for each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although it appears next to nothing amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what it would earn in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;The day&apos;s pay to miners is very high by local standards where 15,000 rupees (1.2-propane euros) pay for the coffee a day and the average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)&quot; - the classloader who worked as a quarrier at the tourist island of Bali earlier explains. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Her salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the site was not as dire, but Anto came back with his family to Banyyuvangi, small town near the volcano, on a good reason that in Indonesia is the same overwhelming as sulphur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus and brought her to Java that it had converted to Islam&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto has asthma, he labors to breathe, constantly continual cough, and at his eyes because of toxic gases water </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At 27, Anto spent three years, risking itself in Kavakh-Idzhena that sulphur has already started to affect it despite a mask and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> It has asthma, he labors to breathe, constantly continual cough, and at her eyes, because of toxic gases emitted by the volcano water. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay to achieve the dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;Two more years because I want to open shop will work or to learn Spanish or French&quot;, he promises in more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punishable by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, the waiter or porter in hotel, but instead she is doing the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o&apos;clock in the morning because sulphur did not stop following at night, when its distinctive yellow lines in blue and shines amid the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Challenging the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, shining itself the way, with the flashlight connected to his helmet he purchased on the money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters drag baskets sulfur on the shoulders of a volcano bottom </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profits, the mining company has not designing sulphur production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment to porters who work at the expense and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they did not even receive a part of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for shooting, which, along with the admission ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2-propane euros), guards of the reserve increase from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work for cattle, not for people&quot; - Badrusin, a stocky porter 42 who spent three decades, since college in Kavakh-Idzhena says. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> The ability to bring to 110 kilograms, he insists he will suffer work &quot;so much, how many will be able&quot; because the money to education for their three children aged between 18 and 10 years should. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not resign, I will die here, because the volcano are my whole life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although sulphur burns the throat and burning eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so strong that no doesn&apos;t complain of a serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual trouble breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder ulcers that were deformed under the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing with a basket on the back, Unaynik can lift now 50 kilograms at 53 years. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano three trucks transport on a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming distance at 18 miles on the narrow path among the bushes. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;I will not resign, I will die here, because the volcano are my whole life&quot; - Unaynik declares, opening his mouth wide where there is no more teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> From his five children, a senior, 30 years, also works with sulphur carrier. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation, one of the hardest classes in the world: in what human mules from Kavakh-Idzhen do. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education of a lack of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband Patriot, you are my wife a patriot, we will fulfill our duty, and we will create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem unlikely that these lines are part of advertising mint bread, but in spite of this, or perhaps thanks to this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of rap, which uses local sayings it seems &quot;Let&apos;s put Bao (roll) in the oven&quot; to laugh, fertility rates in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes hope that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an engaging way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> The creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use music force that people met &quot;the national duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is the main problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world on reproduction similar, so we felt that is the subject that we should mention. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government has tried to make a lot of things, for example to carry out the launch of beaches or to organize parties of rapid dating (blits appointments). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but optional worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought why us not to make the most creative thing from can tackle this problem, namely to compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who do not take it lightly, so the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1.300 US dollars a year for policies to the enthusiasm of citizens on the birth of more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The state package for married couples and parents gives 15,000 dollars for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But it has low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a rich and high-tech party city in southeast Asia, also known for conservatism of the management and strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national authority on population is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time, it was less than 2 - what is known as a substitute percent in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans have no more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Vey of Min, director of the Office of policy of married couples and families of the National Directorate of the population, said that the reason for that &quot;improved education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of careers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This allowed people to have a wider range of options with regard to the life goals and priorities, and weddings and family life&quot;, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes of social norms promote growth in the number of bachelors and postponing marriage and the birth of children, so the birthrate in Singapore declined. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to confront a declining population, causes outrage among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants flourish, particularly Chinese who criticize to keep wages low and unwillingness to be integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Immigration growth is seen as one of the reasons for that last year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, by means of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>

<seg id="2627"> A guide to urban development passed to control the number of small apartments known as &quot;a shoe box&quot; that can be built in some areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments of 46 square meters very well sold. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a single way of life and remove incentives for developers who want to build large family housing. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Put, the director general of house-building company EL Developers, said that they &quot;shoe boxes&quot; sold much faster than more spacious copies. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular in the sense that the apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments in the larger size. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our revenue increase. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers who put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project before. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too over-extended </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is the city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules may be a step toward increasing national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in financial quarter of the centre, it seems that they will not have special effect. </seg>

<seg id="2681"> Maryelos Porras, an English teacher and an expert on education and training, believes that to send children and adolescents, it is important to understand that the purpose of social networks, to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet appeared as a means to information, but with the arrival of these sites rules of the game&quot; changed, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras indicates that the academic Mark Prenski, master of education at Yale and author of the work Digital natives and immigrants, invented these dates to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives they, children and young people who were born in an era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are digital immigrants should teach them while we continue to study&quot;, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that the topic is complex, &quot;because we are asking to have some measure of what is possible or it is impossible to distribute, publish or say, the elderly, when the maturity lacks for this purpose&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;That they are selective, while the most important thing is to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about consequences&quot;, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality children and adolescents, ask questions that force them to reflect. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell them that they did not do this, it is useless&quot;, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then Porras lists some options: There are things that you wouldn&apos;t say the stranger, so why you do it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, it would be nice to you if posted the photo you like, what do you published with a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign photos from parties if you ask for permission from other people to mark them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another whether all need to know what you do at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to let them know that they should behave online just as do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> The rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Out of the Internet people behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles as should be on social networks&quot;, she said. </seg>

<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America should learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the purpose for which &quot;South America, in this case and must learn from Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television of Peru that Europeans &quot;were killing each other during World War II&quot; in other conflicts, &quot;but they now almost a homeland&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in this context, a project of the establishment of the South American citizenship, approved by members of the Union of South American Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We need to make the free movement of citizens and workers over a South American country as it is now happening with members of the Andean community, but there are reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past&quot;, he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The Ecuadorian president proved, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the impact of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account of those who signed a Pact of San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who give lectures, never undertake any obligation, and we South Americans, on the contrary, we sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is funded by the United States&quot;, he said, referring to the political asylum made by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder to Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that does not regret this decision because he did not betray the principles, and observed the &quot;deep values of democracy and human rights&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that in due time &quot;there were some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and process&quot; will not be upheld. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> It criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to come to its territory for questioning about the alleged crime of sexual violence, while &quot;Swedish law finds it difficult to implement it via video conference, which could be made of the Embassy of Ecuador in London&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I haven&apos;t spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonic problem, nothing serious&quot; - the Ecuadorian president said. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What really is, so it is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of the prison in tiny spaces without being able to do exercises on air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of any person&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the shelter granted Assange since June in Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts and stressed that there were talks in London about finding a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We are not talking about human rights, we in this case do not use the word, but there were ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem is found in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts because Assange&apos;s lawyer, Baltazar Garson, leads a number of processes in various European authorities&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Also suggested that &quot;if Britain will provide tomorrow a security guarantee, it will end&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden as permitted heavily_endowed by its law and as it has done in other cases, interviewing Senor Assange in embassy of Ecuador in London or to question him on Skype, tomorrow the problem would be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa seized the opportunity to prove as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not suffer &quot;mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The main enemies of press freedom is not spolit villains politicians, and a bad journalists calling for a profit, blackmail and extortion&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> At this point he was happy to have these journalists, &quot;neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries hegemons do not dominate Ecuador&quot; and added that, being re-elected &quot;will deepen the revolution to development continued in the right direction&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to retain the veto of Paraguay in the Union of South American Nations to at least the next election, arguing that the organization &quot;must be strong and not suffer opportunism and support of revolutions in the guise of legitimacy&quot; because in reality &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The Ecuadorian president regarded &quot;perfect sense&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which appeared in favor of the Nicaraguan sea sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> However, this decision is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and to continue moving forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> He also expressed the hope of good end of the dispute on the maritime boundaries that lead in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed that &quot;it is right to appeal for Latin America in international courts if the two countries agree to make a decision, no matter how hard it was&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that believes this opportunity &quot;with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if they lose elections in February 2013, will leave public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Personally I was never interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be adjusted only from the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement seen exactly what I guaranteed this likely victory so it must accept that responsibility&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If elected, it would be my deadline as president, and then we leave public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, the same. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;The decision&quot;, he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which had already been planned, routine and that is expected to pass campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;This does not mean the worsening of the health of the President Chavez&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The head of the Ecuadorian government participated today in Lima in the VI summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrice was 21 years old when she was told that his analysis on AIDS yielded positive results. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;Me as if stunned&quot;, he recalls that difficult, despite all the step of a doctor, the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man hid it from the family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Having decided to cope with the disease themselves, he wanted to know about it as much as possible. And his effort was true - he had celebrated the 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrice is one of the &quot;oldest&quot; patients of HIV office of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital where he was in 1994, having overcome many obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He lives with his diagnosis &quot;human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (HIV) 22 years. In the early 1990s he would be difficult to believe it is too little then existed treatment options, too few people knew about disease, also was biased against patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> So even the director of the clinic for the Mexican Institute for Social protection didn&apos;t want to say goodbye to it, &quot;because it had a cut&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, in those days have AIDS was a sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Now you can survive at this syndrome and to do so, without damaging the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, without knowing about the illness, many more people come when the virus has already caused damage &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in the right time, and the survival of the general population exactly the same&quot;, the head of HIV office of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva said, referring to that this was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the extent of the defeat of the immune system available to patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy at those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with CD4 number 200, and to 50 years, when it was reported about 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> In other words, this means that the one who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, &quot;supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years&quot;, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To assess this progress, it is important to remember that life expectancy of Mexicans averages today 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although mortality fell dramatically in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report from UNAIDS) that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in a national database died is also true. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 death by May this year are already registered; However, it is claimed that there is a universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Why there are still lethal endings? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> What I think the problem is not in access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I imagine it, things in our hospital so. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients are very late because they don&apos;t know about contaminated state, that is, in the late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It provided massive data: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when already have any opportunistic infection- You need to do to make a bigger impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and should therefore be tests to detect on a massive scale, for all people who will ask him &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In offering experts and officials of the State Council in AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) and patients, like Fabrice who turned to check in the private laboratory, prompted only that it was made by his friend and, despite an early age agree it was at the stage of AIDS and even had Kaposha&apos;s sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think will die, and want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;Time, all the same I die, I will be better to be cut three times a week&quot;, they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I know eat, I do exercises, I take medicine. </seg>

<seg id="2828"> Given the ratification of the decision by the court of appeal of the United States, which cancels debt restructuring of the Vitro Group, achieved through competitive products in Mexico, the script sets a precedent for a national company with branches in the neighboring country to solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems that procedures in support of the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law, were not effective in the country of bands and stars, in conflict with international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practices, approval of a decision reached on June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale in court of bankruptcies of the northern District of Texas, leaves unwarlike Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of the seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> But the resolution is opening the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, bringing into evidence three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> As an introduction, while the judge of business notes that creditors should be regulated by the Code of the US to bankruptcy, the court of appeal of the fifth district located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings concerns the competitive products considered in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first paragraph overturns international judicial cooperation in insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the Model law of the UN on international trade law Union was created for the purpose, defined as an arbitrator the American institute of Law. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Second, the verdict establishes that without the intercompany vote, acknowledged in a critical mass of competitive products of debt that had Vitro branches before the parent company, would not be reached the majority needed for the adoption of restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, this capability is acknowledged by the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the laboratory was not the first time the scheme is adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are a half-dozen examples including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debt guaranteed Federal institute of competitive industries. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that subtracting the voices of industries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who had fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely stervyatniki funds like Aurelios capital Aurelios Convergencia, Elliott Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote would be 45 per cent against 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The Court of Appeal lowers the data. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses the Laboratory of the difficult situation facing that came up since 2008, affected by severe economic crisis, which surpassed the United States military strikes on the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> Meanwhile, the family firm Gonzalez Sada will show the decision appeal in court of appeal that the vote reached its plenum, that is, the five judges in view of the fact that three voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> In the event of failure of a petition for a certificate which will require a process review from a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court will be shown. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Worse still, the court rejected a document sent by the government of Mexico as affiliate amicus curiae (&quot;a friend of court&quot;) in that process, to which Vitro within the Law on competitive production follows described, signaling that it frees itself (himself) by their enforcement of the agreements signed by both countries to connect it with article 15 of the Law of the US to bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> It is also noted that the country responded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that is, to the rules for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Canon from two boards: they hit in Vitro and hit the country. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2868"> A keen basketball traveler Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was due more than 60 years with the sport and, thanks to it, visited the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico store in memory so many basketball history, as Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> After all, before the hemorrhage chained to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, the player of the Highest basketball league, the representative and head of BSN with Cowboys of Bayamon and president of the Federation of basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I spent many roles in basketball throughout his life, including a little at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, director general of the National team and the president of federation in the 1990s&quot;, Reyes alsoremembered during Primera Hora visit to his home to Bayamon where he lives with Isabel, a faithful wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes does not exaggerate, making this statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected for a long way, witness. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamon in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the greatest emotions it stores who remember his way through the Cowboys since the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his performance as a coagent or agent of the deal were executed. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;It was my best years that I enjoyed most of all because had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, coagent or head. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of pleasure, including five championships, has gone from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, in a year of the debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, and from now on &quot;Kuko&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator &quot;began to direct, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartov who came here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) told me: &quot;I you have a very strong player, growth 6 &apos;7&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;You want?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who Puerto Rico had. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Boards then recommended sniper Raimonda Gauss, who granted citizenship and became one of our best goal-scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that said that if Minsi brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help to win one more. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> With Gauss I took pleasure in the championship of Cowboys, but already at a distance in that 1988 were the chief of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By then I preferred to have his achievements and achievements of Minsi as a national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember we won for the first time against the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then the 1990 World Championships in which we received a fourth place came along and it had to be a bronze if not for the Canadian judge who made us to change the final game, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> That team from the 1990 World Championships is the best team that you&apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> He is among the best as well as that defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was that from the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the of the USA national team which was too similar to that which won us the bronze in the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> In the team not only again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramon system, FICO Lopez and &apos;Pikulin&apos; (Ortiz) but also young (Javier) &apos;Tonyito&apos; colona and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco, and Edgar) and Mario &apos;Quixote&apos; Morales, who could not participate in the 1990s year because of a wound to the knee. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team that was probably not the best in the state plan, but brought the gold medal and a great joy, there was a team of Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neukena, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role players like &apos;Kanito&apos; Nyeves Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Jurruitner instead of players, suspended for the turmoil in the Pan American championship Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> No doubt that it was Pikulin Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its performance on the international tournaments impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico did not rule at this level as it was done by Pikulin. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And it without his career in different leagues, in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto Rican head? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good young growth including by Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raimonda Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> From young, I really like Leo Arilla&apos;s work. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you consider the greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s, BSN was to 17 teams in the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What did you need to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to know, for example, regionalization of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that boys from Ponce played only in the area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now children travel and play too much, and it is excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and the course for managing directors, officers and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What you do now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, I watch music videos of my era at YouTube, I&apos;m enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally I go to basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, I enjoy society of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me. </seg>

<seg id="2964"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize that it will be the most apocalyptic semester from all&quot;, said Sharma this week to university students Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you analyse what is happening in the world now, as if we have only 30 days, it was really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that bad it is good for those apocalyptic view. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor who offers courses on &quot;doomsday&quot; in this semester, theoretically, the last in history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Templsky university associate professor Barry Wacker gives the process &quot;the media, Culture and Doomsday&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2972"> This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and studied how they related to the real-life examples. </seg>

<seg id="2975"> &quot;We do not add &apos;2012&apos; to always be able to give the course again if the end of the world does not come&quot; - Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite &quot;inevitable destruction&quot; students should learn, develop projects and pass the exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In Penn State final exam will be adopted on the eve of the Apocalypse that does not go to students of choice but to work &quot;until that night in which it has estimated that there will come the end of the world&quot;, Restall said. </seg>

<seg id="2985"> &quot;I never heard of a course that would teach it&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> It&apos;s nice to me. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students interviewed - not to mention the professor, did not say that believes in doomsday date on December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project mentioned a prophecy of Maya, and in some ways we discredited it&quot;, Julie Zeglen, says student last year at Templsky university from Uest-Chester said. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> Maya never predicted the end of the world; It is a key moment in the calendar, Restall said. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he noted that there was an apocalyptic concerns in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicted the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet caused increasing that speculation. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;Elsewhere, people don&apos;t think of it&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Mainly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion at the University La-Sal who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knows about any course about &quot;doomsday&quot; there. </seg>
