<seg id="7"> Anger over Bali bomb plotter&apos;s sentence </seg>
<seg id="8"> Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia&apos;s most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He could be released within 15 years if granted parole. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys. </seg>
<seg id="17"> &quot;He should be put in front of the firing squad,&quot; Ms Corteen told AAP. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Peter Hughes was in Paddy&apos;s Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier. </seg>
<seg id="21"> He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and &quot;died&quot; three times while on life support. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To keep him alive, well, there&apos;s no reason to keep him alive. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it&apos;s not much. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later. </seg>
<seg id="28"> During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda. </seg>
<seg id="29"> &quot;He didn&apos;t give himself up,&quot; Ms Corteen said. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Until just recently, he really didn&apos;t feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia. </seg>
<seg id="32"> &quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; Ms Corteen said. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Patek may yet appeal his sentence. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 airplane will be supplied to Europe </seg>
<seg id="35"> Russia expects that after strengthening on the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 airplanes will also be supplied to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="36"> &quot;We expect that altogether we will receive such contracts for more than 170 airplanes of similar type,&quot; Interfax quotes the words of Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev spoken by him at a press conference with the prime minister of France Jean-Marc Ayrault. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been set up with French colleagues since this is a joint project. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Today we discussed certain financial issues that were related to insurance, but we hope that after this airplane strengthens on the markets of Latin America and the Asian-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="39"> &quot;I hope that some day it will be supplied to France as well,&quot; emphasized the Russian prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="40"> SSJ-100 is an airplane built by the company &quot;Sukhoi Civil Aircraft&quot; in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The jetliner was developed based on modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The goalkeeper of &quot;Chicago&quot; Nikolai Khabibulin emphasized: he understands that he must play better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at practices. </seg>
<seg id="44"> At the last two meetings of the &quot;Hawks&quot; Khabibulin initially let through six pucks from &quot;Tampa Bay&quot;, and then four from &quot;Ottawa&quot;, though in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck. </seg>
<seg id="45"> We have to play good, and in the last two games I was not able to do that, - CSN Chicago quotes Khabibulin. </seg>
<seg id="46"> - I need to find confidence at practices, probably it&apos;s worth approaching them like games, and try to achieve the best result. </seg>
<seg id="47"> You have to study your past games and work on those flaws that were present. </seg>
<seg id="48"> There are several small components that I need to improve, but at practices I feel pretty good. </seg>
<seg id="49"> But for some reason after several goals everything turns into a kind of snowball. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Possibly I need to relax a little. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Goalkeepers - I don&apos;t think that I am the only one - always strive to play a perfect game. </seg>
<seg id="52"> If I miss four, five, six, I am not delighted. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It does not matter what happens in front of my goalposts. </seg>
<seg id="54"> I still work on myself in order to not miss so many pucks. </seg>
<seg id="55"> It is great that my teammates are supporting, but essentially everything is simple: I have to play better. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Two games - it is not the entire season, but I wanted to play them much better. </seg>
<seg id="57"> But what happened did happen. </seg>
<seg id="58"> I have to put that aside. </seg>
<seg id="59"> I will simply try to play the next match better. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Power engineers of Dnepropetrovschina have begun a unique program to save... stork nests </seg>
<seg id="61"> In old times, in order to attract storks to the yard, villagers installed a cart wheel on a high post and a heavy nest held up well on it. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Such special supports have long since not been set up, therefore storks have taken fancy to the poles of electric power transmission lines - interwoven branches are supported by wires, thanks to which a stork home sits securely. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Grandma Anya, near the home of which a stork family has been living for already about twenty years in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district, began to notice that the nest sags despite all the efforts of its inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The birds place new branches on top, but the lower layer has already sunk between the wires, will collapse any minute. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Of course, it&apos;s a pity for the family of storks that each year have nested near the inn, they hatched and nursed three-four chicks over the summer, but I&apos;d also rather not be without light. </seg>
<seg id="66"> As soon as the birds flew away to warm territories, Grandma Anya called the Tsarichansky regional power network to which the pole belongs. </seg>
<seg id="67"> And did not even expect that there they would respond so fast. </seg>
<seg id="68"> When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still hangs on at all, - recounted the technical director of DFPC &quot;Dneprooblenergo&quot; Sergei Berezovsky. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Corrosion had begun on the wires that ended up essentially inside the nest weighing 150-200 kilograms. </seg>
<seg id="70"> At any moment the birds could have died from electric discharge. </seg>
<seg id="71"> And indeed the local residents risked being left without light due to the damage of the wires. </seg>
<seg id="72"> For that reason the linemen began an operation to save the nest, and this is already not the first time in our practical experience. </seg>
<seg id="73"> We were helped by scientist-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University who developed a scheme for moving the nest. </seg>
<seg id="74"> They even conducted training for employees of regional networks. </seg>
<seg id="75"> The well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the power specialists at all stages of nest reconstruction. </seg>
<seg id="76"> For a start, they figured that in the region more than 50 stork &quot;apartments&quot; are in an unsafe condition. </seg>
<seg id="77"> For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded. </seg>
<seg id="78"> They braided the frame with willow branches, and then moved the old nest to it. </seg>
<seg id="79"> According to experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a base so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Later the storks will finish constructing their home themselves. </seg>
<seg id="81"> A month ago in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsky district the first nest was reconstructed. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Next to the power support they placed a new reinforced concrete post and arranged on it a platform with the old, already lived-in nest. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The entire operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnia. </seg>
<seg id="84"> And the other day the same kind of housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district at the inn of Grandma Anya. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Here they secured the platform in its previous place, only they slightly raised it above the wires. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Ornithologists are confident that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their &quot;apartment&quot; underwent capital repairs. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Before the end of the year the same reconstruction awaits another four nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovschina. </seg>
<seg id="88"> By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are mercilessly killing them. </seg>
<seg id="89"> The other day sad news spread over the region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolovsky district, on the opening day of pheasant hunting, poachers just for the fun of it gunned down a family of swans dwelling at a local pond. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The noble birds did not fear people at all - local residents fed them and did not offend. </seg>
<seg id="91"> When the villagers, hearing gunshots, ran up to the pond, four beautiful swans already laid dead on the water. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Presently employees of the Apostolovsky district police department are ascertaining who shot the birds listed in the Red Data Book. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing for departure </seg>
<seg id="94"> The American airplane that conducted observation flights over Russian territory within the framework of the Treaty on Open Skies and made an unscheduled landing on Wednesday in Chita will leave the city&apos;s air harbor on Friday, November 1 at 8:30 Moscow time. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Management of the airport permitted departure of the craft after receiving money for fuel. </seg>
<seg id="96"> As reported at the airport, the airplane will depart to Ulan-Ude. </seg>
<seg id="97"> According to other data, it will head to the U.S. </seg>
<seg id="98"> As was reported, the airplane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in Zabaykalsky Krai due to fog. </seg>
<seg id="99"> They had not released it from the Chita airport due to unpaid accounts. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Aboard the plane are 30 people, including the crew, they spent two nights on the territory of the airport, reports ITAR-TASS. </seg>
<seg id="101"> As RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported, according to the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people aboard aircraft shall not go beyond the confines of the Chita airport, they may pass through border control only in two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992, 34 nations participate in it. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Observation flights take place over territories of Russia, the U.S., Canada, countries of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="104"> The main objectives of the Treaty - development of transparency, assistance to observation of fulfillment of agreements in the sphere of arms control, expansion of capabilities to prevent crises and resolution of crisis situations within the framework of OSCE and other international organizations. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Vitaliy Mutko: Water cannons? </seg>
<seg id="106"> It seems to me that we are back about 15 years in the past. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Minister of sports Vitaliy Mutko voiced his opinion on the disturbances in the stands during the Russian Cup match &quot;Shinnik&quot; - &quot;Spartak&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="108"> I advocate that clubs, leagues, RFU as organizers of sporting events be responsible for all that. </seg>
<seg id="109"> But as we can see, they have taken a different position. </seg>
<seg id="110"> They expect that someone from the outside will come and establish order. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This is a very nice position, but not entirely correct. </seg>
<seg id="112"> It is necessary to organize fans, clubs must invite their stewards and not let things slide. </seg>
<seg id="113"> We just developed a special government order concerning the rules for behavior at stadiums. </seg>
<seg id="114"> After it is adopted, we will closely examine this problem. </seg>
<seg id="115"> But I will also certainly invite all organizers of the football process. </seg>
<seg id="116"> I&apos;ve read the interview with Leonid Fedun. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Government, he says, give us a law pronto. </seg>
<seg id="118"> It feels as if fans of &quot;Bavaria&quot; came to Yaroslavl and caused all this. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And we are outside observers. </seg>
<seg id="120"> But it really is terrible to see how they shower the stands from a water cannon. </seg>
<seg id="121"> And this happens in a country that is preparing for the world championships. </seg>
<seg id="122"> &quot;I have the feeling that we have went back 10-15 years,&quot; said Mutko. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed </seg>
<seg id="124"> Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough </seg>
<seg id="125"> The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed </seg>
<seg id="126"> Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court </seg>
<seg id="127"> A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit. </seg>
<seg id="129"> The solicitor, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and hailed by criminals as a &quot;top brief,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer&apos;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Inquiries revealed Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates. </seg>
<seg id="133"> All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="134"> They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed </seg>
<seg id="136"> Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. </seg>
<seg id="137"> He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing. </seg>
<seg id="138"> The lawyer&apos;s downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta&apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer&apos;s bins in a black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them. </seg>
<seg id="142"> The court heard Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards </seg>
<seg id="143"> Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot;legal privilege.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="144"> During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him. </seg>
<seg id="145"> In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business. </seg>
<seg id="146"> But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: &quot;If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="148"> Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients. </seg>
<seg id="149"> The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="151"> But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship. </seg>
<seg id="152"> He thwarted the police&apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it. </seg>
<seg id="154"> He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="156"> But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="157"> His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Lancashire&apos;s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law. </seg>
<seg id="162"> We will find you and put you before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences. </seg>
<seg id="165"> On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake </seg>
<seg id="167"> A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month&apos;s Dubai Airshow. </seg>
<seg id="168"> The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event. </seg>
<seg id="171"> How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; jet designs. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing says its revamped &quot;777X&quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled &quot;Would You Accept This?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="177"> &quot;Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="178"> As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened &quot;jet set&quot; was narrower. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing disputes Airbus&apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="184"> It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They don&apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Boeing&apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use. </seg>
<seg id="194"> &quot;The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe&apos;s Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="195"> On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares. </seg>
<seg id="196"> &quot;Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,&quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Oleynikov: a third of rural villages of the Moscow region are fully subsidized </seg>
<seg id="204"> The vice governor of the Moscow region Yuriy Oleynikov stated that almost a third of rural villages in the Moscow region are fully subsidized </seg>
<seg id="205"> In total 187 villages out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget. </seg>
<seg id="206"> In 2013 187 villages out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget. </seg>
<seg id="207"> The proportion of subsidies within the amount of budget revenues of 122 rural villages exceeds 50%, and 83 are one hundred percent subsidized. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Within the scope of fiscal capacity, around 25 billion rubles is directed from the regional budget,&quot; said Oleynikov. </seg>
<seg id="209"> The vice governor also noted that for only three municipal villages - Mytischi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the amount of budget revenues amounts to over 1 billion rubles for 2013. </seg>
<seg id="210"> The revenues of rural villages of many regions are less than 3 million rubles, &quot;this is not nearly enough&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Expenses on maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 villages of the Moscow region amount to more than 70%, &quot;moreover a reduction in quality of services is observed&quot;, noted Oleynikov. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Previously he ordered the heads of municipal formations of the Moscow region before the end of November to think about which villages require integration, incorporation into municipal districts or a change in the administrative management system. </seg>
<seg id="213"> These proposals will be processed by the end of January. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Before that, the governor of the Moscow region announced that within the scope of administrative reform, in the Moscow region it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural villages. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Also in Mozhaysk, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensk districts, Lyubertsi and Kotelniki there is demand for consolidation of municipalities. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Chairman of the Moscow Regional Duma Igor Bryntsalov also announced that in total they plan to consolidate around 30 rural villages and 12 districts of the Moscow region as part of the forthcoming administrative reform. </seg>
<seg id="218"> This is associated with the fact that of 178 rural villages in the Moscow region less than a third have an &quot;acceptable&quot; financial base, and 100 are subsidized. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash </seg>
<seg id="220"> With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique&apos;s founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration. </seg>
<seg id="221"> &quot;We want peace back; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;we demand security&quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital&apos;s Independence Square on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="223"> For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa&apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country&apos;s independent government. </seg>
<seg id="225"> After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US. </seg>
<seg id="228"> The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group&apos;s leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo&apos;s spokesman, told the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="231"> The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="232"> President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="234"> Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="235"> But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord. </seg>
<seg id="236"> He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="237"> &quot;Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="238"> Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="239"> &quot;It&apos;s two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert. </seg>
<seg id="240"> Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Renamo&apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country&apos;s democracy. </seg>
<seg id="246"> &quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="247"> It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal. </seg>
<seg id="249"> In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line. </seg>
<seg id="250"> Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability. </seg>
<seg id="255"> &quot;No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now </seg>
<seg id="257"> Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot;airplane&quot; mode. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings. </seg>
<seg id="260"> Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures. </seg>
<seg id="261"> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="262"> &quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; it said. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator. </seg>
<seg id="265"> &quot;We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes,&quot; a spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now. </seg>
<seg id="267"> &quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that,&quot; it said. </seg>
<seg id="268"> The FAA ruling applies to American airlines. </seg>
<seg id="269"> However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA&apos;s decision and the reasons behind it. </seg>
<seg id="270"> For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings. </seg>
<seg id="272"> &quot;Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes,&quot; the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="273"> In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing. </seg>
<seg id="274"> The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Obama&apos;s Health Care Walk Back </seg>
<seg id="276"> Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that &quot;if you like your health plan, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="277"> With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public. </seg>
<seg id="278"> Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge. </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="280"> Addressing what he called the &quot;flurry in the news&quot; about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace. </seg>
<seg id="281"> Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected. </seg>
<seg id="282"> &quot;You&apos;re going to get a better deal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="283"> The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn&apos;t meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot;miserably&quot; since October. </seg>
<seg id="286"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="287"> I am eager to earn your confidence back. </seg>
<seg id="288"> An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday&apos;s House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="289"> More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Dmitry Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be considered impartially </seg>
<seg id="291"> The RF Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday announced that the case of Greenpeace activists will be examined in strict accordance with Russian legislation. </seg>
<seg id="292"> France can have no doubt that examination of the case will be conducted in compliance with legislation, we hear all concerns. </seg>
<seg id="293"> &quot;We can guarantee adherence to laws,&quot; declared Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France Jean-Marc Ayrault. </seg>
<seg id="294"> There is is a citizen of France among the detained Greenpeace activists. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Just as the other activists, Pierre Pisanu has been charged with hooliganism. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;I asked if we could expect an act of good-will in relation to the detained citizen,&quot; &quot;RIA Novosti&quot; cites Mr. Ayrault. </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;Our country cannot support activity that could damage the environment, no one has the right to violate laws,&quot; Dmitry Medvedev declared in turn. </seg>
<seg id="298"> According to him, the attempt of any structures to affect technologically complex and dangerous processes, including the production of energy sources, is a hazardous activity. </seg>
<seg id="299"> He emphasized that these facilities are &quot;like a powder keg&quot;, and recalled what occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, reports &quot;RIA Novosti&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The girlfriend of Semyon Varlamov declared that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism </seg>
<seg id="301"> The girlfriend of Semyon Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinyuk declared that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service. </seg>
<seg id="302"> &quot;He has no idea about how to stop drinking,&quot; the woman declared in particular. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Let us recall that Vavrinyuk sued for battery the goalkeeper of Team Russia Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the &quot;Colorado&quot; club. </seg>
<seg id="304"> According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and beat up - after the attack her hands, chest, stomach and neck were injured. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Varlamov surrendered himself to Denver police and admitted to battery, describing the event in detail. </seg>
<seg id="306"> He was arrested, but later was released on bail of $5,000. </seg>
<seg id="307"> The court did not restrict the athlete&apos;s movements in the country but prohibited approaching Vavrinyuk. </seg>
<seg id="308"> He also faces imprisonment for a term of up to 6 years for domestic violence. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer free of charge </seg>
<seg id="310"> The studio Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for PC free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="311"> This is reported by WoW Insider. </seg>
<seg id="312"> According to its data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="313"> However, some gamers note that presently only those users whose accounts are linked to the American portion of the service can download it. </seg>
<seg id="314"> The game is also still inaccessible for Russian users. </seg>
<seg id="315"> As the media reports, the version that Blizzard just released for PC by appearance does not differ from the original version of the game. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged. </seg>
<seg id="317"> The platformer Blackthorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, initially came out for SNES consoles. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its events were set on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms. </seg>
<seg id="319"> One day the dark ruler Sarlac decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="320"> The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle who was saved from death by being sent to Earth. </seg>
<seg id="321"> Twenty years later he returned to Tuul in order to battle against the henchmen of Sarlac and protect the planet&apos;s inhabitants from them. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Before that it was called Silicon &amp; Synapse. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The publisher of Blackthorne was the company Interplay. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip </seg>
<seg id="326"> Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot;attractive special adviser,&quot; Hannah Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby&apos;s voicemails and &quot;door-stepped&quot; her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard. </seg>
<seg id="329"> &quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people&apos;s houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say,&quot; Mr Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="330"> He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The editor is personally involved in the third. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do. </seg>
<seg id="333"> What about the first? </seg>
<seg id="334"> Does he know about phone hacking? </seg>
<seg id="335"> He says he doesn&apos;t, we say &quot;Oh yes, he did&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="336"> Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW&apos;s features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: &quot;Don&apos;t bother wasting your time, she&apos;s with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="337"> A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire&apos;s home in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Investigators also found entries on the private investigator&apos;s computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as &quot;Projects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="339"> During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby&apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby&apos;s movements. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: &quot;I&apos;ve got a story that we&apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="342"> Mr Edis said Coulson&apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett. </seg>
<seg id="343"> The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking. </seg>
<seg id="346"> There is no &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; group In Ministry of Internal Affairs databases to which the U.S. linked Leps </seg>
<seg id="347"> The &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; group, to which Washington has linked the singer Grigory Leps, does not appear in the databases of Russian security agencies. </seg>
<seg id="348"> As pointed out to Interfax in law enforcement agencies of the RF, after reports of Grigory Leps being entered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury into blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; emerged in the media, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Security Agencies believe that distribution of such information helps maintain the myth about the so-called &quot;Russian mafia&quot;, which supposedly operates abroad. </seg>
<seg id="350"> &quot;Even in the name itself - &apos;Brotherly Circle&apos;, there is a certain element of mystery, containing a hint of a secret lodge. </seg>
<seg id="351"> &quot;All this is very similar to a PR stunt,&quot; said an agency source. </seg>
<seg id="352"> On October 31, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the entry of Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Ribalskiy and Igor Shlikov into its blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="353"> The persons entered into this list are suspected of links to a certain Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are on U.S. sanctions lists since February of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="354"> According to American authorities, Grigory Leps &quot;serves as a courier for delivering money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="355"> At Grigory Leps&apos; production center, they declined to comment on the U.S. accusations leveled at the singer, calling it &quot;nonsense&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="356"> In 2011, president of the United States Barack Obama added the syndicate &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; to the list of &quot;significant transnational organized criminal groups&quot; and ordered the Department of the Treasury to &quot;disrupt and inhibit their global criminal operations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="357"> A person&apos;s entry into blacklists of the American Department of the Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with him by persons living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog&apos;s tail are linked to its mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog&apos;s point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: &quot;It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we attempted to look at it in other species. </seg>
<seg id="363"> He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the pets&apos; heart rates and analysed their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="366"> It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other </seg>
<seg id="367"> Prof Vallortigara said: &quot;We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="368"> When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog&apos;s point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog&apos;s point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Prof Vallortigara said he didn&apos;t think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn&apos;t feel worried about. </seg>
<seg id="372"> He said: &quot;If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal&apos;s emotions. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol&apos;s school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos;tail&apos; was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines. </seg>
<seg id="378"> A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> &quot;While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Is Europe&apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain? </seg>
<seg id="382"> Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK&apos;s wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="383"> To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="384"> YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain&apos;s business sizes, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="385"> The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU&apos;s arcane institutions. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="389"> There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe&apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics. </seg>
<seg id="391"> This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that brings powers back to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="392"> The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain&apos;s membership of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="394"> It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK. </seg>
<seg id="395"> A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="396"> The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels&quot; regulatory approach. </seg>
<seg id="397"> A politician in Turkey went on a hunger strike in opposition to walls on the border with Syria </seg>
<seg id="398"> In mid October, authorities began construction of a dividing wall near the city of Nusaybin in southeast Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurd party BDP came out harshly against the construction. </seg>
<seg id="400"> The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin near the Syrian border, Aishe Gokkan went on a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported RIA Novosti at the press office of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations. </seg>
<seg id="402"> The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muammer Guler initially denied the construction, then announced that the wall is being constructed to provide border security. </seg>
<seg id="403"> &quot;The mayor of Nusaybin, Aishe Gokhan, a member of the BDP, went on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against construction of the wall into a deadly fight,&quot; they announced in the party&apos;s press office. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The mayor of the city believes that construction of the wall was designed to isolate the Kurdish people of the two countries from one another, Kurds have been crossing the border freely for half a century. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Representatives of the party quote Aishe Gokhan: &quot;This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never consent&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="406"> According to the press office, a protest against construction of the dividing wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin. </seg>
<seg id="407"> This morning in Saratskiy district the driver of a &quot;Peugeot&quot; drove onto the oncoming lane at 115 km of the Odessa-Reni highway and collided with a bus carrying six people. </seg>
<seg id="408"> This is being reported by the press office of the Road Emergency Service Administration in the Odessa region. </seg>
<seg id="409"> As a result of the incident, the 31-year-old driver of the &quot;Peugeot&quot; died. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Injured were a 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver, whose leg was jammed. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Medical personnel rendered first aid to the woman on the spot, she declined hospitalization. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Emergency medical personnel also examined all remaining passengers. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Rescuers lifted the bus with the aid of a crane and freed the bus driver whose leg was jammed in the door of the bus. </seg>
<seg id="414"> There is no point being a vegan in Siberia: a hothouse tomato will not replace soup </seg>
<seg id="415"> A correspondent from RIA Novosti explained why vegetarianism does not suit life in Siberia. </seg>
<seg id="416"> People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Here they could not endure the winter without damage to health, and no hothouse tomatoes will compensate them, believe Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of Vegetarian Day. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Drink liters of oil </seg>
<seg id="419"> Strict vegetarianism, when they abstain not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, honey, eggs, is becoming a popular way of life. </seg>
<seg id="420"> However, doctors-nutritionists are confident that to follow such strict norms in nutrition in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia is at the least unhealthy. </seg>
<seg id="421"> A total rejection of animal products is harmful. </seg>
<seg id="422"> In animal proteins there are essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate with vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="423"> It is absolutely necessary to include at least milk or eggs into a diet,&quot; assures nutritionist Marina Bogai. </seg>
<seg id="424"> She cites as an example fish containing the essential fatty acid Omega-3. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The vegetable oil most rich in it is made of flax. </seg>
<seg id="426"> &quot;In order to consume it in the amounts required for a human, it is necessary to drink liters of it!&quot; says the nutritionist. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Medical professionals are confident that residents of Siberia need to give special attention to diet in the winter. </seg>
<seg id="428"> During this season, vegetarianism is especially dubious. </seg>
<seg id="429"> In our actual living conditions, high demands are placed on food. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Increased caloric content is needed not to freeze. </seg>
<seg id="431"> &quot;If a person restricts his animal products, he will fall short of that caloric content accordingly,&quot; says the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Doctor-nutritionist Olga Poznyak agrees with this. </seg>
<seg id="433"> She adds that imported vegetables and fruits is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="434"> It is better for a person to eat predominately products that were raised in the region of residence or there where he was born. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The genetic code is configured for better assimilation and digestion of these products. </seg>
<seg id="436"> And in winter people do not want to gnaw on a cucumber, but hot soup or something else more nourishing,&quot; the doctor explains her view. </seg>
<seg id="437"> According to her, out of what vegans can eat, really healthy are various cereals, croups, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries. </seg>
<seg id="438"> But this is unequivocally insufficient for good nourishment. </seg>
<seg id="439"> According to doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, in the bodies of Siberians the level of vitamins is sufficient only from the middle of August through the middle of September. </seg>
<seg id="440"> A full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and snow lies in May, is not appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The body needs energy for life, and that is, above all, fat,&quot; states the medical professional. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Children are growing, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="444"> But by adhering to vegetarianism, we provide them inadequately. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Pregnant women also need high-protein food, vitamins and minerals on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="446"> &quot;Vegans do not receive enough of them,&quot; assures Bogai. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Arifulina says that an adult person is free to choose whatever he likes, &quot;to play with the toys that he wants&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="448"> He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs. </seg>
<seg id="449"> But children nonetheless must be nourished adequately. </seg>
<seg id="450"> If parents deprive him of some kinds of minerals or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, this is simply a violation of the child&apos;s rights. </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;You will not be able to restore tomorrow deficiencies of some or other substances for development of the brain, vision, bones,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="452"> All surveyed expert medical professionals agree on the low quality of winter-grown hothouse and imported vegetables and fruits. </seg>
<seg id="453"> What they import to us and what is grown in hothouses contains less minerals essential to us than (grown) on open ground. </seg>
<seg id="454"> &quot;The quality of products is not right,&quot; says Bogai. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Sometimes the desire of producers to gather a large harvest harms quality. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;Apples do not become brown when cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and non-aromatic,&quot; the medical professional cites examples, adding that they are most likely crammed with an excessive amount of fertilizers. </seg>
<seg id="458"> And they become providers not of vitamins, but of cellulose. </seg>
<seg id="459"> The head of the laboratory of the Siberian physics and technological institute of agricultural issues, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with this. </seg>
<seg id="460"> She says that with the correct approach and adherence to all norms and requirements, it is possible to grow wholesome vegetables in hothouses. </seg>
<seg id="461"> If they try to force out more from a square meter, then, of course, they also begin to water more frequently, and overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For example, when there are too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and not sweet,&quot; she explains, adding that the issue of quality primarily depends on the conscience of the producer. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Russia is not involved in the struggle with urban vechicle-pollution </seg>
<seg id="464"> Attempts to solve transportation problems inherent to large cities have been observed in most of the world&apos;s megalopolises since the second half of the 20th century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> As a rule this has involved either reconstruction and expansion of main roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and their usage time. </seg>
<seg id="466"> One widely known example is that of Singapore, where a rigid quota system curbs the growing number of private vehicles, and the right to acquire vehicles is bought via auctions. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Its price could be two to three times higher than the actual price of the vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="468"> European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to drive into the city center. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, has established so-called green zones that allow only vehicles rated with a certain ecological class that also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars). </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Beijing environmental protection agency, for example, in 2012 confirmed a &quot;five-year clean air plan&quot; with a total cost of approximately 250 billion yuan (around $40 billion). </seg>
<seg id="471"> As told to Kommersant by Lee Kunsheng, the director of the vehicular pollution supervision department of the municipal agency of Beijing environmental protection, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, as well as to prevent the number of privately-owned vehicles from exceeding 6 million (it is currently at 5.2 million) and to prevent fuel usage per vehicle from increasing by more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Based on data from the agency, in Beijing automotive transport is currently responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The key measures of the program include restricted use of automotive transport as well as additional taxes imposed on vehicle owners. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Some of the citywide measures envisaged by the &quot;green five-year plan&quot; include an accelerated transition to Euro fuel standards ahead of the rest of the country, introduction of a local system of environmental standards and markings for vehicles and fuels, restricted vehicle access to the central part of the city, prohibited use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of financial incentive programs to replace old cars with hybrids or electric cars), development of electric transportation (including for public and official use), and development of public transport (including high-speed). </seg>
<seg id="475"> Some of the vehicle-based innovations introduced by Beijing include a measure that prohibits operation of all private vehicles within the fifth transport ring (in total the Chinese capital has six of them) one day per week (appropriate information is displayed on the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of vehicle license plates based on a lottery (for example, in 2011, which was the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits to register private vehicles in Beijing made up only a third of the total number from 2010). </seg>
<seg id="476"> In accordance with the active government program titled &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020&quot;, the number of cities rated with high or very high air pollution shall be reduced to 128 (there were 138 in 2012). </seg>
<seg id="477"> According to data from the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 &quot;mobile sources&quot; accounted for 41% of all air pollutant emissions in cities. </seg>
<seg id="478"> In Moscow, for example, emissions from vehicles are ten times higher than industrial emissions, while in St. Petersburg they are nine times higher. </seg>
<seg id="479"> At present, the Russian Federation is merely just beginning to think about the possibilities for regulating vehicles on city streets. </seg>
<seg id="480"> Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Economics for Transportation and Transportation Policy of the Higher School of Economics, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel are notoriously unpopular, and could be accepted by the public only if they are universally applied. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Moscow has a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle population, in which there are two clusters that are only slightly sensitive to any regulatory measures - official and private vehicles, as well as vehicles of &quot;privileged&quot; people who number at least 200 thousand (nearly 5% of the total vehicle population of Moscow). </seg>
<seg id="482"> Recently, urban researchers from the EKOM center in St. Petersburg conducted studies that analyze the balance between city territory and residential areas, road surface area and number of motor vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Main conclusions of the researchers: the city center contains less than half the roads it needs, and the majority of drivers who live in the center do not use their vehicles every day but leave them in parking areas or simply on the streets for long periods. </seg>
<seg id="484"> As a result, they propose construction of vehicle storage areas instead of parking areas, and narrowing of roadways (so that streets become more pedestrian-friendly) instead of their expansion, and also propose placing restrictions on driving and parking personal vehicles within the protected zone of the historical city center (which occupies a territory of approximately 3,212 hectares and covers a number of central districts of the city). </seg>
<seg id="485"> The tax maneuver that provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax (MET) for oil simultaneously with the reduction in export duties and increase in excise taxes will lead to more expensive fuel. </seg>
<seg id="486"> According to experts, these measures could bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles into the budget. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care </seg>
<seg id="488"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="490"> There aren&apos;t many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="491"> Cast your vote here or through your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="492"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="493"> You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year. </seg>
<seg id="494"> That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="495"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren&apos;t equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon&apos;s capital. </seg>
<seg id="497"> He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="498"> &quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; Georges Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="499"> We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get. </seg>
<seg id="501"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="502"> You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> There are a lot of patients. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Some people can die because they are waiting. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The situation hasn&apos;t changed much since Bwelle&apos;s father passed away in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="507"> For comparison&apos;s sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn&apos;t afford it. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country&apos;s health-care spending is private. </seg>
<seg id="510"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="511"> And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year. </seg>
<seg id="514"> He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde&apos;s Central Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="515"> And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Their luck doesn&apos;t always hold out. </seg>
<seg id="519"> They&apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes&apos; welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer. </seg>
<seg id="521"> In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> &quot;We are receiving 500 people in each trip,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they&apos;re coming on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that&apos;s required for school but that many impoverished families simply can&apos;t afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With the group&apos;s generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="531"> It&apos;s a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One man explained that the free hernia surgery he&apos;d received will allow him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;This will change my future with my family,&quot; the man said. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="538"> It&apos;s this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;I&apos;m not sure when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O&apos;Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle&apos;s group. </seg>
<seg id="540"> He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="541"> For medical and nursing students such as O&apos;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it&apos;s a hands-on opportunity they&apos;d never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> &quot;We&apos;ve been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="543"> That&apos;s not something you&apos;d ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> &quot;He&apos;s a hero, without a doubt,&quot; O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="547"> He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn&apos;t a hardship. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;I am so happy when I am doing this work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="551"> And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope he sees what I am doing. </seg>
<seg id="553"> To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that&apos;s why I&apos;m doing this. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Check out the ASCOVIME website and see how to help. </seg>
<seg id="555"> In the U.S. a new name has finally taken hold for the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; - &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> This week the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; blacklist in America was replenished with new names and four companies. </seg>
<seg id="557"> The U.S. Department of the Treasury entered three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="558"> One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the U.S. suspects of transporting money for members of the group. </seg>
<seg id="559"> In total in the U.S. black list are 22 persons linked to the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;, and six organizations affiliated with it. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Nonetheless many experts are expressing doubts that such an organization actually exists. </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;The announcement about the &apos;Brotherly Circle&apos; looks more like an attempt to merge disconnected criminal groups,&quot; previously stated the expert on organized crime and professor of New York University Mark Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="562"> According to him, the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,&quot; the American Center for Research of Corruption and Organized Crime cites Mr. Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="564"> George Mason University professor Louise Shelly also agrees with Mr. Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="565"> &quot;Even if they operate jointly, then this looks more like a criminal network, but not an organization,&quot; she is quoted by the Center for Research of Corruption and Organized Crime. </seg>
<seg id="566"> In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti conjectured that the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; to a large extent unites those those close to the Russian &quot;thief in law&quot; Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hasan. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The crime boss was killed in January of this year. </seg>
<seg id="568"> For example, the activity of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakhary Kalashov, who augmented the list in 2012, was tightly linked to Grandpa Hasan, and another entry in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandpa Hasan. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that several of the persons have no relation to Usoyan. </seg>
<seg id="570"> According to him, common financial and criminal interests, for example, deliveries of narcotics from Afghanistan, more likely united them all. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion into the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian president Vladimir Putin - caught the attention of the Kremlin. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Naturally, we expect to receive from our American colleagues-partners more detailed information based on which such a decision was made, why they added him to such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov. </seg>
<seg id="573"> In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF. </seg>
<seg id="574"> His interests will be protected just as the interests of all citizens of the RF. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Tony Blair said he&apos;d seize the chance to return as Britain&apos;s prime minister - but acknowledges a comeback is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="576"> In an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old aired his views on various domestic policies. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, confining most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair was quoted by London&apos;s Evening Standard as saying: &quot;Yes, sure, but it&apos;s not likely to happen is it, so...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="579"> The head trainer of &quot;Milan&quot; Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret regarding the draw in the 10th round match of the Italy Championships against &quot;Lazio&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> The expert also noted that failures at the start were caused by a series of injuries of leading players. </seg>
<seg id="581"> I am really sorry that we were not able to win, Tmw quotes Allegri. </seg>
<seg id="582"> The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="583"> In the first half we did not allow &quot;Lazio&quot; anything. </seg>
<seg id="584"> In the second the Romans gained, but on the whole I cannot say that we lost concentration. </seg>
<seg id="585"> We needed to win. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Last season we met the objective to make it to the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Now we are behind schedule, but this was caused by an entire series of injures of key footballers. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Rami and Honda? </seg>
<seg id="589"> Those are very good players, with character. </seg>
<seg id="590"> However, our roster is also good now. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Look at Kaka, who played the meet at a high level. </seg>
<seg id="592"> British police serve Assange with extradition notice </seg>
<seg id="593"> Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London and requested asylum. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Scotland Yard said they had served a &quot;surrender notice&quot; on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum. </seg>

<seg id="601"> Presently Roman Senchin is in Paris at a presentation of his novel &quot;Yeltishevi&quot;, translated into French. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Let us recall that precisely this novel of his became a finalist for four awards: &quot;Clear glade&quot;, &quot;Russian Booker&quot;, &quot;National bestseller&quot; and &quot;Big book&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="603"> And last year for this book the author was conferred awards from the government of the Russian Federation relating to culture. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of present-day thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Virtually every publication of his harsh stories and tales based on modern life material incites heated debates among critics from the most diverse areas. </seg>
<seg id="606"> It is fair to say that, combined together, the articles on prose and political essays of Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990&apos;s to the beginning of the 2010&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="607"> In discussions on the works &quot;of one of the most controversial modern writers&quot;, according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, the dialog for the most part is guided by how participants understand the word &quot;literature&quot;, how they view the present and future not only of our literature, but also of our life. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow its inclusion of the majority of articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere. </seg>

<seg id="610"> They may interrogate Snowden in Russia </seg>
<seg id="611"> Former employee of American intelligence agencies Edward Snowden most likely will not leave Russia to provide testimony on the matters regarding the wiretapping of telephone conversations of the chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="612"> As a source familiar with the situation stated to Interfax, the American can respond to the questions of representatives of the German Prosecutor&apos;s Office in writing or face-to-face in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The departure of Edward Snowden beyond Russia is virtually excluded. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;In such a case he would lose the status of a refugee and may be turned over to Washington by allied countries of the U.S.,&quot; said an agency source. </seg>
<seg id="615"> &quot;Instead, basically the Prosecutor&apos;s Office of Germany could send its representatives to the RF or submit written questions to Snowden,&quot; added the source, adding that this issue must be handled at an international level. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Previously, deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Stroebele reported that Edward Snowden is ready to provide testimony on the matter regarding the wiretapping of conversations of the chancellor of Germany by American intelligence agencies. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Snowden is ready to provide testimony to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="618"> The former employee of the CIA indicated that he knows quite a lot. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has obstructed all of his movements, Snowden is willing to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="620"> However, for that it is necessary to clearly define all conditions of his arrival,&quot; reported Stroebele to the television channel Euronews. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Snowden&apos;s lawyer Anatoliy Kucherena, commenting on the statement by the Interfax source, announced that his client may collaborate with German investigators, but when and how - he will decide himself. </seg>
<seg id="622"> The U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who had worked in the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May of 2013, after which he disclosed information on secret operations of U.S. intelligence agencies regarding internet surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Snowden was flying transit through Moscow, but could not leave the airport because U.S. authorities revoked his passport, in absentia claiming serious accusations against him, and until the beginning of August he has remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport. </seg>
<seg id="624"> On the first of August Snowden received a document conferring him temporary refuge on the territory of Russia for a period of one year and on that same day he left Sheremetyevo. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Yesterday the American&apos;s lawyer Anatoliy Kucherena announced that his client got a job at a &quot;major Russian company&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="626"> German media reported on the NSA wiretapping of Angela Merkel last week. </seg>
<seg id="627"> According to journalists, the Americans began to wiretap the chancellor&apos;s telephone conversations in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="628"> The surveillance station allegedly was located in the U.S. embassy in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="629"> After publication of these data German authorities announced that surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany. </seg>

<seg id="632"> Options include upgraded brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistic support, and vehicle storage between events. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Drew Bowler, the managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> They&apos;re not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure, and an achievable path towards world-class events. </seg>
<seg id="635"> We&apos;re delighted to be offering this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas, and prepare entrants for the rigours and realities of Rally Raid. </seg>

<seg id="638"> Children should be taught myths and legends as &quot;models for a way of life&quot;, author says. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Tales of Thor could show &quot;brute strength is no match for subtle trickery,&quot; while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Saying many of the myths would be &quot;far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools,&quot; Crossley-Holland advocated a &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate works. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="643"> He added authors and teachers being &quot;overtly didactic&quot; is a &quot;total switch-off&quot; for children, with messages being &quot;subliminated&quot; in enjoyable stories. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: &quot;You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil. </seg>
<seg id="647"> And that must be subliminated; revealed through a story rather than stated. </seg>
<seg id="648"> The old basis of showing not telling. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned of risks for the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the key driver of the fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> This is primarily a crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and massive job cuts. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main concern now is not the slowing of growth, but rather the structure of that growth. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Recently growth has been fully determined by consumption, which is seeing virtually no slowdown,&quot; said the chief economist for Goldman Sachs of Russia, Clemens Grafe while presenting the investment bank&apos;s quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Presently, the nominal growth of wages in Russia is around 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> With 6% inflation, it could keep the future consumer demand at approximately the current level, anticipates Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> However, the profitability of Russian companies is going down, therefore they will most likely begin optimizing personnel costs. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today we are seeing substantial growth in the wage share of GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP grows only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Companies have been confronted with reduced profitability. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If it does not grow, this could lead to layoffs and growth of unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Russian business has no choice but to increase wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and CIS countries Vladimir Pantyushin. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high. </seg>
<seg id="662"> In order to lure employees from outside or retain existing ones, employers have to raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia is supported also by a rapid growth of consumer loans. </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of loan does not exert a multiplier effect on the country&apos;s economy. </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;We have not seen any benefits to the economy from the growth in consumer loans, money is not distributed throughout the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interests payments,&quot; said the economist. </seg>
<seg id="666"> However, the problem lies elsewhere- Goldman Sachs anticipates a growth in delinquency on unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="667"> They are primarily taken out by modest-income people who have nothing to provide as collateral. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The interest rates for such loans are high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As a result, they are more often not paid back,&quot; noted Mr. Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The director of the Banking Institute of the Higher School of Economics Vasiliy Solodkov is now already seeing signs of an imminent banking crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Minor credit organizations that do not have the same access to cheap resources as state banks were forced to attract funds from the general population at high interest rates. </seg>
<seg id="673"> In response, state banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, continues the economist. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Minor credit organizations cannot offer loans with those same interest rates, otherwise they would have a negative interest margin. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If state banks do not forgo dumping, Russia will face a full-scale banking crisis, supposes Vasiliy Solodkov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The economist considers the revocation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks to be a harbinger of a massive crash. </seg>
<seg id="677"> &quot;State banks themselves will not be able to handle such a situation: the endowment insurance system was not initially designed to handle a systemic crisis,&quot; warns the head of the institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> However, the growth of consumption will slow even without a non-payment crisis, they propose in the investment bank - due to the refusal to adjust the wages of government employees and military personnel pledged in the current version of the draft budget. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partially, the blow on consumption will be softened by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by reducing inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no preconditions for that so far - see the reference), growth of consumption will nevertheless be slowed, they are confident at Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital so far sees no preconditions for the actualization of pessimistic scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> &quot;The main risk is still a drop in the price of oil,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> According to his assessment, Russia&apos;s economy will begin to contract at an oil price lower than 90 dollars per barrel. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In Goldman Sachs they have also noted that the Central Bank is so far unable to reduce interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> A paradoxical picture is being observed: inflation decreased, but banks began to raise rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This could mean that they did not believe the Central Bank when it announced the transition to inflation targeting,&quot; said Clemens Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not influence market rates, it influences only the rates of interbank lending. </seg>
<seg id="688"> &quot;For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hope,&quot; assessed Clemens Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Money obtained at Central Bank auctions are not used by banks to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, this means that funds attempt to escape to speculations against the ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> &quot;Sooner or later, Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,&quot; said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the government plans to &quot;free float&quot; the ruble by the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> However, they must either do this sooner, or raise the key rate of Central Bank (5.5%), he believes. </seg>
<seg id="693"> According to his assessment, the exchange rate of the ruble is currently artificially elevated by 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> The ruble has only one way out - to weaken, - concludes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if Central Bank instills in financiers even a shadow of doubt that liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy for weakening of the ruble, this could bring down the ruble much more strongly. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snowden agreed to provide testimony on the wiretapping of Merkel </seg>
<seg id="697"> Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Stroebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="698"> During the conversation a question arose, whether Snowden can be interrogated as a witness by the German Prosecutor&apos;s Office on the case of the possible wiretapping of the telephone of the German chancellor by U.S. intelligence agencies. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Snowden expressed willingness to provide the necessary testimony. </seg>
<seg id="700"> The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> He clearly conveyed, - said Hans-Christian Stroebele, - that he knows quite a lot. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And despite the fact that the National Security Agency headed by Kieth Alexander has obstructed all of his movements, Snowden is willing to come to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> However, first it is necessary to clearly define all conditions of his arrival. . </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, American lawmakers are beginning to take measures in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs. </seg>
<seg id="705"> The Senate intelligence committee yesterday approved draft legislation introducing additional restrictions on the activity of the American electronic intelligence agency. </seg>
<seg id="706"> FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls) </seg>
<seg id="707"> Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers shouldn&apos;t expect changes to happen immediately. </seg>
<seg id="709"> How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they&apos;ve updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> &quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane&apos;s door closes. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They&apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we&apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win,&quot; Glading said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We&apos;re frankly tired of feeling like &apos;hall monitors&apos; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="724"> So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="725"> And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="726"> In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="728"> FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="729"> Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="730"> &quot;Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they&apos;re in the air,&quot; Rosenker said. </seg>
<seg id="731"> An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices. </seg>
<seg id="736"> The FAA began restricting passengers&apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day. </seg>
<seg id="737"> New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers&apos; use of the devices has been Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none. </seg>
<seg id="746"> FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility. </seg>
<seg id="750"> A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;We&apos;re pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president </seg>
<seg id="753"> Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and countries of the Eastern partnership - such an announcement to the BNS agency was made in the department of state security of the republic (DGB). </seg>
<seg id="754"> Information about this was published on the DELFI portal. </seg>
<seg id="755"> According to the report, in particular Moscow intends to &quot;slander&quot; the president of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents supposedly found in a Russian state archive that concern facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader. </seg>
<seg id="756"> According to an intelligence agency, preparation of the informational attack is led by the department of analysis of public processes of the directorate of the administration of the president of Russia concerning interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries. </seg>
<seg id="757"> The structure is headed by Evgeniy Umerenkov who repeatedly visited Lithuania and took part in a meeting of the Lithuanian People&apos;s Party. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Department employee V. Smirnov is also allegedly a participant of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="759"> As asserts the intelligence agency, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work, regularly came to Lithuania until the end of 2012 and made contact with local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Now Smirnov has been barred entry into the territory of the country. </seg>
<seg id="761"> On the previous day the president of Lithuania Grybauskaite announced that she knows about the information attack being prepared against her. </seg>
<seg id="762"> According to her, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the &quot;striving of the country toward energy independence&quot; </seg>
<seg id="763"> The Lithuanian leader previously repeatedly criticized the actions of Russian authorities. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For example, she stated that in the Kremlin they treat Lithuania &quot;without due respect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="765"> Moreover, Grybauskaite accused the head of the RF Vladimir Putin of pushing &quot;only demands&quot; toward Lithuania. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Let us recall that in September Rospotrebnadzor suspended imports of Lithuanian milk into Russia. </seg>
<seg id="767"> It was reported that the quality of the products do not conform to sanitary and epidemiological norms. </seg>
<seg id="768"> At that time the leader of Lithuania declared that if Russia does not withdraw the ban, the administration of the country must prepare an address to the WTO. </seg>
<seg id="769"> New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking </seg>
<seg id="770"> Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="771"> A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches,&quot; Prof Cornell said. </seg>
<seg id="774"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="777"> In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity. </seg>
<seg id="778"> But mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot;chilled out,&quot; say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains. </seg>
<seg id="779"> The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit. </seg>
<seg id="785"> &quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="786"> British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Pre-winter chores. </seg>

<seg id="790"> Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage </seg>
<seg id="791"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can. </seg>
<seg id="793"> The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they&apos;re at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&apos;Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance. </seg>
<seg id="796"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to charge that,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board. </seg>
<seg id="800"> O&apos;Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money. </seg>
<seg id="801"> It&apos;s about Frontier&apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline&apos;s website won&apos;t have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="803"> That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag. </seg>
<seg id="804"> O&apos;Malley said Frontier&apos;s website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="805"> Frontier&apos;s new carry-on fee won&apos;t start until summer, though a date hasn&apos;t been set. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> Most haven&apos;t touched carry-on bag fees, though. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed. </seg>
<seg id="811"> The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary&apos;s Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees. </seg>
<seg id="812"> He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit&apos;s carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he&apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit&apos;s unusual carry-on bag fee. </seg>
<seg id="814"> &quot;The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and it boarded lickety-split.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="817"> Frontier is also following Spirit&apos;s $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It will still give away water. </seg>
<seg id="820"> US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Frontier&apos;s move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don&apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="823"> That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip. </seg>
<seg id="827"> So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic has been trying to fix Frontier&apos;s finances as part of selling the airline. </seg>
<seg id="832"> Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad </seg>
<seg id="833"> And now - news from across the ocean, and particularly - from Syria, where, as we became aware of today, Israel launched a strike against rockets of Russian manufacture, which, according to reports, were intended for &quot;Hezbollah&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Today Syria fulfilled an important condition - destroy its production of chemical weapons by November 1. </seg>
<seg id="835"> This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through the mediation of Russia and allowing the U.S. to not conduct a military operation to which they came close this summer. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Our chief international correspondent Richard Engel will tell more about the weapons and about what all of this means for the Syrian president. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Washington declared that the Assad regime will be punished for this. </seg>
<seg id="838"> More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, perished in August from poisonous gas. </seg>
<seg id="839"> And the punishment came. </seg>
<seg id="840"> But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad&apos;s friend - Vladimir Putin. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year. </seg>
<seg id="842"> And today - a major milestone. </seg>
<seg id="843"> A group of international experts reported that Syria has disabled its declared factories producing chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="844"> A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and its components. </seg>
<seg id="845"> As we understand, this is approximately a thousand tons. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Previously Washington said that Assad&apos;s days are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="847"> I think that Assad should resign. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The question is not if this will happen, but when it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="849"> He is no longer legitimate and must resign. </seg>
<seg id="850"> But Assad remains. </seg>
<seg id="851"> And feels even more confident. </seg>
<seg id="852"> His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm. </seg>
<seg id="853"> His enemies are divided and poorly armed. </seg>
<seg id="854"> His people involuntarily abandon their homes, many are starving. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Some have to feed themselves with leaves and cats. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder. </seg>
<seg id="857"> They are calling the agreement on chemical weapons a diplomatic success, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a person willing to cooperate. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Today in Washington the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions. </seg>
<seg id="859"> When a child dies from hunger, his mother is hardly comforted by the fact that they did not kill him using chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Assad for now is holding on. </seg>
<seg id="861"> And is exchanging weapons for power. </seg>
<seg id="862"> A Tomsk resident will work off 240 hours for an extremist clip on a social network </seg>
<seg id="863"> The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work a city resident who placed an extremist video clip on a social network, a representative of the press service of the district court reported to RIA Novosti on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="864"> According to the court, in March of 2013 the man placed on his page in a popular social network a video clip that was entered into the federal list of extremist materials. </seg>
<seg id="865"> In relation to him, a criminal case was initiated based on the article of the RF Criminal Code &quot;Actions aimed at arousing hatred or animosity, as well as disparaging a person, committed publicly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="866"> &quot;The Lenin district court examined this case in a special procedure and found the man guilty of committing the above-cited crimes, assigning a punishment in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work,&quot; said the agency source. </seg>
<seg id="867"> She added that the man fully admitted his guilt. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick &apos;Gender Undetermined&apos; </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="870"> No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The new law doesn&apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred. </seg>
<seg id="875"> An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl. </seg>
<seg id="876"> They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Wallis Simpson may have been intersex. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it&apos;s better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child&apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all. </seg>
<seg id="879"> New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> Intersex children pose ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> &quot;Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens. </seg>
<seg id="885"> It&apos;s like the mystery of why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a &quot;third gender&quot; on their official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world&apos;s first recognized &quot;genderless&quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot;gender theory&quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that &quot;as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="896"> One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don&apos;t know the gender of your child,&quot; she told the parenting website. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="902"> &quot;Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a &apos;psychiatric emergency,&apos;&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When these kids were born, you didn&apos;t call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable. </seg>
<seg id="905"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child&apos;s genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one 1966 case, known as &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories became controversial. </seg>
<seg id="907"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> &quot;Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But at 38, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Drescher said that now some doctors are still &quot;practicing that model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot;not happy with the outcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="913"> Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Doctors couldn&apos;t be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="915"> So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce&apos;s external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> He was given female hormones at age 12. </seg>
<seg id="917"> &quot;I knew that I wasn&apos;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records. </seg>
<seg id="921"> What he found out was horrifying. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals. </seg>
<seg id="924"> After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Surgery rendered him infertile. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos;undetermined,&apos;&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We are afraid it will encourage intervention. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we haven&apos;t seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="934"> German law is about assigning it at birth. </seg>
<seg id="935"> That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will &quot;empower&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Baratz&apos;s daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="940"> She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy. </seg>
<seg id="943"> &quot;The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves,&quot; said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos;male&apos; or &apos;female.&apos; </seg>
<seg id="945"> This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We don&apos;t have to rush into surgery that is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="948"> &quot;It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don&apos;t feel they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that&apos;s a wonderful thing. </seg>
<seg id="950"> It empowers children to make the decision for themselves. </seg>
<seg id="951"> U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies at times &quot;went too far&quot; when gathering data </seg>
<seg id="952"> U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when gathering data and wiretapping, American intelligence agencies at times &quot;went too far&quot;, nonetheless the politician noted that information about the wiretaps of 70 million people that emerged in the media does not reflect reality. </seg>
<seg id="953"> I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but an attempt to gather information did exist. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Yes, in some cases it went too far and was legally inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="955"> I acknowledge it, as the president also acknowledges... and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future, the AFP cites the secretary of state. </seg>
<seg id="956"> As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind. </seg>
<seg id="959"> The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years. </seg>
<seg id="962"> And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since. </seg>
<seg id="964"> His mother Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee are a great double act.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="965"> They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette. </seg>
<seg id="966"> It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him. </seg>
<seg id="968"> The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Mrs Howells said: &quot;The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="970"> He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The way he has started he&apos;ll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll do well. </seg>
<seg id="973"> A spokesman for the annual horse show said: &quot;Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="974"> They are a great team together. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring. </seg>
<seg id="976"> They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring. </seg>
<seg id="977"> I&apos;m sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part. </seg>
<seg id="978"> A commuter bus flipped over in Altai. </seg>
<seg id="979"> A PAZ commuter bus flipped over in the Rubtsovsky district of Altai Territory. </seg>
<seg id="980"> As a result of the road accident, according to updated data, 13 people were injured, they reported in the regional administration of the Emergency Ministry. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Previously law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 injured. </seg>
<seg id="982"> According to agency information, the accident occurred around 9 o&apos;clock in the morning local time on the Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka highway 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka. </seg>
<seg id="983"> 12 passengers and a driver were in the bus traveling from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all incurred injuries of various severity and have been hospitalized. </seg>

<seg id="985"> Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy </seg>
<seg id="986"> A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge&apos;s order requiring changes to the New York Police Department&apos;s stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case. </seg>
<seg id="987"> The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city. </seg>
<seg id="988"> The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people. </seg>
<seg id="989"> The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it. </seg>
<seg id="990"> The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay. </seg>
<seg id="991"> The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program. </seg>
<seg id="993"> She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur. </seg>
<seg id="994"> In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop. </seg>
<seg id="995"> An oral argument on the city&apos;s appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="996"> The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Supporters of changes to the NYPD&apos;s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The judge noted she wasn&apos;t putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union </seg>
<seg id="1003"> The prime minister of Ukraine Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will significantly decrease after the country signs the association agreement with the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> He stated this while chatting with readers of his page on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which are, among others, customs payments. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> So, after the signing of the agreement and the enactment of the provision on the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will significantly decrease. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> And this will mean that prices should also decrease. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;This is in respect to goods that come from countries of the EU,&quot; wrote Azarov. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> In respect to other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> But, nevertheless, there should not be an increase in prices there either. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Therefore, the messages on billboards that have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, saying the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not entirely true, or if we speak more accurately - entirely not true,&quot; summarized Azarov. </seg>

<seg id="1016"> &quot;The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state,&quot; Ms Plibersek said today. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> There&apos;s also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> &quot;These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania&apos;s health system,&quot; Ms Plibersek said. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little &quot;unless it&apos;s followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania&apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1025"> He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> &quot;I&apos;m hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state&apos;s public health system off the critical list,&quot; Mr Wilkie said. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&apos;s announcement is a &quot;band-aid solution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system,&quot; he told ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> You can&apos;t have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it&apos;s a good news day. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> An Obama voter&apos;s cry of despair </seg>
<seg id="1033"> I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change </seg>
<seg id="1034"> He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Obstructionism can&apos;t excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Obama&apos;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I&apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It&apos;s a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win,&quot; and it&apos;s a memoir of Barack Obama&apos;s 2008 presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When I&apos;m finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> During Obama&apos;s transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> And then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> It&apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> It was simply nothing I could have imagined. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of &quot;don&apos;t ask don&apos;t tell,&quot; to the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I&apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I&apos;ve reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House&apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I don&apos;t know if this is what I should have expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Obviously, elective office isn&apos;t a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration&apos;s own choosing. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> That is what troubles me most of all. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Still, as Obama&apos;s approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> &quot;I want us to get our mojo back,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> We&apos;ve got to remember who we are.&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1074"> It&apos;s five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn&apos;t agree with you more. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Egypt swears in first freely elected president </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country&apos;s first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world&apos;s first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt&apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> He took the oath before the court&apos;s 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> &quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Derided as the Brotherhood&apos;s uncharismatic &quot;spare tyre,&quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> &quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> His arrival was greeted with chants of, &quot;The army and the people are one hand,&quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university&apos;s main lecture room. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military&apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Morsi&apos;s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> The exam will also feature &quot;unseen texts&quot; to encourage wider reading; </seg>
<seg id="1098"> A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> It will make changes in other core subjects next year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a &quot;widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting GCSEs would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> The syllabus will place a greater focus on &quot;real world problems,&quot; including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football - a cause for discord? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma as part of &quot;Open Tribune&quot;, politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals, the following was heard: ban football in the Northern Caucasus because from this game comes nothing but scandals and discord. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulevo and said that in order to reduce the &quot;degree of tension in society&quot; politicians and mass media must be proper in statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Probably he had in mind the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one telecast threatened to enclose the Caucasus with barbed wire if they did not want to limit the birth rate there... </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All speakers also talked about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples inhabiting Russia, which added confusion to the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maksim Grigoryev stated that the events in Biryulevo are a &quot;model conflict, which could have been predicted&quot;, but &quot;here too many people and authorities are responsible for these issues&quot;, and with seven nannies the child loses an eye. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe practiced a long time in relation to migrants, according to the social activist, has broken down, and one need to find own way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> The historian Yuriy Petrov entrusted great hopes on a new unitary history book. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> &quot;It is also necessary to create a handbook on the cultural history of peoples of the country, so that high schoolers in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennady Zyuganov suggested introducing criminal liability for &quot;appeals to dismember Russia&quot;: &quot;If in the U.S. you say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska back to Russia, then they will arrest you and give you 20 years in prison!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard to &quot;not incite&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, he blamed everything on journalists, who bring out painful and incisive national problems into public discussion: &quot;In the heat of polemics one could say anything!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The leader of the fraction &quot;United Russia&quot; Vladimir Vasilyev instantly recommended journalists to conclude a &quot;charter&quot; and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can also undertake the same responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the procedure overall has been established, stated Mr. Vasilyev. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> As an example he cited the law that makes regional and municipal authorities responsible for interethnic peace on their territory. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm regarding this law: it does not contain &quot;clear representations about what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> This means that subjects will interpret the scope of those authorities in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Furthermore, municipalities do not have the staff necessary to resolve so many complex issues, no resources, and the center will not give them the methodological recommendations that they could utilize... </seg>
<seg id="1127"> The head of the Duma Committee on Ethnic Matters Gadjimet Safaraliev proposed creating a special department with the formidable name &quot;Ministry of National Security&quot;, which would engage in issues of national politics. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valeriy Tishkov, who in the 90&apos;s headed a similar department that was subsequently abolished, opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It is sufficient to have a special person on the federal level, &quot;a minister without a briefcase&quot; who you can call upon if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> &quot;We walk on the edge, shells are exploding nearby, it is very important for representatives of various ethnicities and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work must receive proper informational support,&quot; said the representative of Russian Orthodox Church for public relations Vsevolod Chaplin. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> According to him, there should be no neutrality of the government in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Here Oleg Nilov diverted the discussion to an unexpected course: &quot;It is hard to find more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, but they are pushed the wrong way, down the wrong road,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;The wrong road&quot; is the development of football: &quot;Here an entire crowd beats up a footballer, there they burn flags, there comrades throw rocks at each other... </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe we don&apos;t need such football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> There is another kind of sport - it&apos;s called rugby... </seg>
<seg id="1136"> &quot;They will have no equal in this type of sport!&quot; the Just Russia party member said heatedly. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - instantly intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You offer them curling too! </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Need to know national specifics, that&apos;s the same as offering a &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; to a Georgian&quot;... </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves with wild behavior in the stands - during a game with a local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> We will have to ban football throughout the country... </seg>
<seg id="1142"> NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1143"> On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&apos;s domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If Europe&apos;s most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> I think it&apos;s conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> &quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies&apos; trade secrets to its own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Business leaders are sceptical about this. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> &quot;That&apos;s not the way,&quot; Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn&apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Everything but the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: &quot;We see a new question from customers that didn&apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> That economic spying takes place is not a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> It has always taken place. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> &quot;This has been a topic for many years and hasn&apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Germany&apos;s BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> &quot;Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access,&quot; the BfV warns in a report. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: &quot;The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to gunfire in one of its terminals. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> An unidentified man opened fire in the third terminal at 09:30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20:30 Moscow time). </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Security evacuated employees and passengers of the second and third terminals. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> According to preliminary data, the man directed fire from a high-powered rifle. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Several people, including an employee of the U.S. transportation security administration, were injured. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Police returned fire and detained the perpetrator. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> He is slightly wounded. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="1193"> Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state&apos;s corruption watchdog. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> It&apos;s now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid&apos;s secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi&apos;s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> &quot;Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy,&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> &quot;No,&quot; Mr Tripodi replied. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> I can&apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn&apos;t that. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> UN hails new goals to tackle poverty </seg>
<seg id="1208"> The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for &quot;sustainable development goals&quot; to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to &quot;rise above national interests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1212"> &quot;I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - SDGs,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> These SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Deductions for capital repairs of the building will appear in utility payment documents of Voronezh residents as a new line of expenses. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> According to the most approximate calculations, from 100 to 400 rubles per month must be additionally paid for a standard two-room apartment starting after the New Year. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The regional government will determine the precise rate. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> On the other hand, the residents themselves will decide on painting the entrance, cleaning up the stair wells, or even replacing the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> Deputies of the regional Duma approved this law. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: &quot;Order must be imposed in this matter as well - prioritize capital repairs of buildings, not accumulate funds in management companies, which here are frequently registered either in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or somewhere else, this will be the establishment of government control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for repairs of multi-apartment buildings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1221"> Participatory construction is now also under control of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> The law protecting against swindlers was approved by the regional Duma in its final reading. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The document did not arise out of thin air. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> 4.5 thousand people suffered from dishonest developers in our region. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> The problems of the majority were able to be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> In fact, the new law prescribes the rights and responsibilities for all participants of equity construction. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, stated: &quot;It is no secret that in this area abuses have also begun related to the fact that in &apos;98 the same shareholders got hit, and the same shareholders in the 2000&apos;s.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1228"> People have begun to make money on it, these two laws were adopted in order to close the loophole, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> It was decided to build a temporary residence center near Voronezh for foreign citizens who are subject to deportation. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The regional parliament adopted such a law not only due to pressure from the federation. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> The region has more than enough problems related to illegal migrants. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Specifically, last year slightly more than 100 thousand foreigners completed migration registration. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But only one in five registered official permission to work. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is highly questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, recounted: &quot;They violated legislation, but are not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> There is no trial, but deportation is necessary - they need to be held somewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> The federation adopted such a solution to arrange such places using regional funds. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> In the Voronezh region, such a place has been determined - it is the Old Olshanka of Semiluksky district. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Well, but finally the regional parliament allotted new benefits to parents with multiple children. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Firstly, families raising 5 or more children are fully exempt from the transport tax. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million - but the parents with multiple children save just as much. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children will be provided housing subsidies beginning in the new year. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters at a price of 30 thousand per meter. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> For example, a family of 6 persons - papa, mama, biological child and 3 adopted. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> For them, according to regulations, the government will acquire housing with an area of 108 square meters for 3 million 300 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> It is a perfectly acceptable option for the left bank or the Southwest microdistrict. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Well, and in the regional center one can buy an entire cottage for that amount. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> CDC issues children&apos;s allergy guidelines for schools </seg>
<seg id="1249"> On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children&apos;s food allergies at school. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children&apos;s food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Kids may say, &quot;It feels like something is poking my tongue,&quot; &quot;My tongue feels like there is hair on it,&quot; or &quot;My tongue is tingling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law </seg>
<seg id="1259"> &quot;It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?&quot; the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> &quot;This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya&apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it&apos;s an extension of the government,&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya&apos;s place in the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> &quot;I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot;a stranglehold over the media,&quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot;dealt a major blow&quot; and lambasted the bill as &quot;draconian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September&apos;s attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot;de-listed,&quot; or barred from receiving official press accreditation. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1270"> It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya&apos;s &quot;lively blogosphere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1271"> By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> &quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Investigators are verifying information about cruel treatment of a child in Biysk </seg>
<seg id="1277"> On October 29 mass media outlets published a report that a teacher from a kindergarten in the city of Biysk locked a child in a cellar for disciplinary purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Presently, all circumstances are being clarified by investigators, and a legal evaluation is being given for the actions of kindergarten employees. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> After being accused of bad taste Evgenia Vasilyeva began to talk </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose persona has riveted the close attention of the media for almost a year, until now has not once commented on the multiple publications in the press about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense as well as about her personally - relations with former defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov, her poetry and passion for valuable things. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> However, on November 1 the figurante in the &quot;Defense service&quot; affair broke her silence. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In an interview with Life News Vasilyeva stated: &quot;From the beginning, of course, there was exactly one objective: pry from me any negative information in relation to the former defense minister.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1283"> There was blackmail in respect to the fact that I have to give testimony, otherwise they will send me to prison. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Presently those threats have ceased. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Next we are going to court, we will prove our innocence. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> We are 100 percent sure of victory. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Moreover, from the interview one can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilyeva was most offended by words to the effect that she has poor taste. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> This is probably in reference to the statement of the official representative of the RF Investigative Committee Vladimir Markin that fakes were detected in the collection of paintings collected by the figurante in the &quot;Defense service&quot; affair. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the proprietress, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> However, a fine art appraisal appointed by investigators after the arrest of the paintings established that they have no artistic value and, to put it plainly, are cheap fakes,&quot; noted Markin in the beginning of October. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense... </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Then they nevertheless admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and also said that I have poor taste. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss certain personal aspects? </seg>
<seg id="1294"> In my opinion, this is simply an outrage,&quot; Vasilyeva says. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Moreover, in response to the question, does she admit her guilt in even one of the 12 criminal counts imputed to her, Vasilyeva stated: &quot;Of course not. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> There is really nothing to admit. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Furthermore, the damage to the Russian Federation at issue does not exist. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> They are simply deceiving the people, end of story. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> In addition, in response to today&apos;s announcement by the RF Investigative Committee that Vasilyeva is evading familiarization with materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the figurante declared that the &quot;investigator is not letting him and his client familiarize themselves with the materials of the case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1300"> What was the reason for the revelations by Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and until now had not communicated with the press? </seg>
<seg id="1301"> Is it possible that as a woman she couldn&apos;t not answer the accusation of bad taste? </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Or are the &quot;Komsomolka&quot; journalists right, asserting a couple of days ago that she &quot;fell into an even deeper trance under house arrest&quot; due to the news of the reconciliation between Anatoliy Serdyukov and his wife and his return to the family bosom? </seg>
<seg id="1303"> The well-known military columnist of &quot;KP&quot; Victor Baranets in his article &quot;Serdyukov returned to his wife?&quot; wrote: &quot;Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during questioning.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Previously Vasilyeva assumed responsibility for several accusations of unlawful sale of real estate property of the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming Italian championship match against Parma. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> As reports Football Italia, the trainer staff decided not to include him in the game bid in order to save him for the match against &quot;Real&quot; in the 4th round of the group stage of the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Lichtsteiner, Vuchinich and Pepe will not take part in the duel with Parma as well. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> However, forward Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from injury and is ready to play. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring the UK together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1312"> Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; to work with the UK government on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1319"> We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1323"> For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; back Scotland&apos;s inclusion in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Mr Brown said: &quot;High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland&apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1325"> So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The U.S. is cutting food assistance benefits for the poor </seg>
<seg id="1328"> The food allowance for a family of four persons is being reduced by 36 dollars per month </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Starting Friday in the U.S. funding of grocery vouchers known as &quot;food stamps&quot; is being reduced because the corresponding government program is expiring. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> Now 36 dollars per month less than before will be allocated for the food assistance benefits of a family of four persons, say officials. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Based on data from the agency Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year benefits per person amounted to 133 dollars per month on average. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Expenses on food assistance in the U.S. grew to 80 billion dollars per year due to the growth of unemployment and of prices on food products. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food assistance issued via &quot;food stamps&quot;, bearing such a name from earlier times when they had the shape of paper coupons. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded in order to stimulate growth of the economy and help the poorest Americans. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> However, Republicans in Congress demand to carry out further cuts in funds allocated for the program, declaring that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Owners of grocery stores throughout America are worried that cuts will lead to reduced expenditures of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> U.S. congressmen continue to debate on how to possibly cut even more financing of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Due to new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks sit in queue on the Russian border almost a week already. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to set up portable toilets </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at border points upon entry into Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs processing of freight. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Ukrainian border patrol guards and customs officers confirm: the line is caused by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Since October 28 customs agencies of Russia have begun to employ additional measures to guarantee delivery of freight, - reported deputy manager of Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> The new document standard is being applied in countries that have joined the convention on international transport. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> Entry points work in an accelerated regime. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> A correspondent of &quot;FACTS&quot; visited the border and talked to truck drivers who ended up hostages of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Prices at the roadside store-cafe at the &quot;Novoazovsk&quot; entry point rise each day just like the line of trucks. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Trucks stand in several rows that spread approximately two kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The customs terminal Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka secures one of the most important transport vectors from southern Ukraine to international motorways. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> From here freights are sent to Stavropol Krai of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> On Sunday until midnight they still let through, but later they introduced the new rules, - complains long-distance truck driver Aleksei Golovanev (on the photo), who hauls freight in transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and sleeps in his vehicle almost a week already. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> According to the new rules, I need an additional packet of documents and payment of freight insurance to cross the border . </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The amount depends on the value of the freight and the distance it will be hauled. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Minimum coverage 4.5−5 thousand rubles (approximately 1,100−1,300 hryvnia). </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Those who will drive a short distance (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a freight valued at up to 50 thousand dollars will pay somewhere around 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnia) and drive on. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> But the rest are stuck - after all no one has such big money with them! </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Imagine, if a driver hauls freight for a sum of only four thousand dollars, but even to Moscow he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit! </seg>
<seg id="1359"> There are no facilities for survival at the border, - complains long-distance truck drivers arranging themselves to eat near their vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At roadside stores and cafes it is always expensive anyway, but we have never encountered such prices like here! </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Salespeople got their bearings and quickly jacked them up: a long loaf costs 15 hryvnia, seven hryvnia - cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - bowl of soup. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> But there is only one cafe. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> And no toilet. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> We sleep in the steppe, we also go there to the toilet. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> No wash, no shave... </seg>
<seg id="1366"> I can even go a week without leaving the vehicle, my wife prepared me everything for the road. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> I can last a week, - another long-distance truck driver Victor Skotarenko comforts himself. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> But will the queue get to my vehicle within a week? </seg>
<seg id="1369"> What is your price for one and a half liters of water? - we inquire in the only border store. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> We have for 11 and for 15 hryvnia. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> What, is the bottle crystal or the water infused in silver? </seg>
<seg id="1372"> We have a cafe, not a store. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Take it while there is still something, - retorts the saleswoman. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> After they began to expose the situation in the media, authorities of the region turned their attention to the dire situation of the Ukrainian drivers. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The leaders of the Amvrosievska and Novoazovsk district government administrations received an order to provide drinking water to everyone who is standing idle in queue on the Ukrainian-Russian border, - announced the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional government administration Sergei Dergunov. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Now ambulance teams are on duty at entry points. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Also portable toilets will be set up for convenience of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> According to an official, the problem associated with the queues will be resolved already in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> As reports the press office of the Donetsk regional government administration, as of October 31, at international entry points &quot;Uspenka&quot; and &quot;Novoazovsk&quot;, 32 and 68 vehicles, respectively, stood idle. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> &quot;FACTS&quot; will monitor the development of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Sony anticipates a lower annual profit </seg>
<seg id="1382"> The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony corporation, having completed the previous quarter with a net loss in the amount of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has curtailed the forecast regarding profit for the current financial year. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> Sony&apos;s results for the period from July through September of 2013 turned out to be more dismal than expected, which is attributable to the drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Sony&apos;s television business, which in the 2nd quarter brought the company its first operating profit in three years in the amount of 5.2 billion yen, in the accounting period has again dropped to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The Japanese market of consumer electronics is experiencing hard times, especially due to the reduced demand for televisions. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> And while competitors are striving to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> For example, one of Sony&apos;s main competitors, Panasonic corporation, is recently shifting its focus to industrial components: here company sales are growing at high rates, especially owing to automobile systems and environmentally friendly technologies. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March of 2014, Sony anticipates receiving 179 billion yen of operating profit versus the previously expected 230 billion yen. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> However, based on data from the agency Thomson Reuters, analysts have proposed that the given indicator will be significantly higher and will amount to 221 billion yen. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> In an effort to recover from the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> In the middle of this month was announced the beginning of sales of &quot;smart&quot; watches from the Japanese corporation that have been equipped with a number of popular functions that help eliminate the need to retrieve a smartphone from your pocket 100 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> After Sony curtailed the annual forecast of profit and earnings, company shares in the morning at the start of trading in Tokyo dropped in price by more than 11%, descending to the level of 1,668 yen per share. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> How much dead celebrities earn - MK in the U.S. MK </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, earning 125 million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> But the deceased Michael Jackson, whose postmortem income from October of 2012 through October of 2013 amounted to 160 million, &quot;outdid&quot; her. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Noticeably behind him are other deceased celebrities who last year &quot;earned&quot; several times less. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Second in the list of the most &quot;prosperous&quot; departed celebrities compiled by Forbes magazine at year&apos;s end was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and a line lower the author of Peanuts comics Charles Schultz with 37 million. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Besides them, into the first five went Elizabeth Taylor, who was leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein also made it into the list. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> A Just Russia proposes to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments with extremism </seg>
<seg id="1401"> For legislative protection of patriotic sentiments of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, &quot;A Just Russia&quot; proposes to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and punish it with five years of prison. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> As the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; reports, such amendments to legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma committee on energy Oleg Mikheev have already been submitted to the Supreme Court and the administration for decision. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The author of the amendments proposes that patriotic sentiments be understood as the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude toward its fate, respect to its history and culture. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> As Mikheev indicates, in domestic legislation there are sanctions against desecration of the formal symbols of government authority - the flag and emblem. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> However, according to the member of parliament, protection of Russians whose sentiments also may be offended by defamation of government symbols and other displays of disrespect to our country, has been insufficiently elaborated in Russian legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> As an example, he cites the discussions expanding every year on the eve of Victory Day, when certain persons in the media venture to cast doubt on the heroic feat of the people of USSR in the fight against the fascists. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The day before the nationwide holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Exercising their wit and &quot;alternative viewpoint&quot; of history, certain publicists come to reasonings about, they say, what a pity that the cultured Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union! </seg>
<seg id="1409"> I consider such to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main &quot;spiritual staple&quot; of the nation,&quot; resents Oleg Mikheev. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> In addition, according to Mikheev, there are a lot more patriotic-spirited than religious people in Russia, moreover the law punishes insults of the sentiments of religious believers, yet it is possible to insult patriotic sentiments virtually without punishment. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> According to the people&apos;s representative, it is necessary to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and prescribe an appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Draft legislation stipulates punishment for insulting patriotic sentiments: from a fine of 100 thousand to 5 years imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The influence of prison wardens will rise in the new structures of public supervisory committees </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Today, the council of the Public Chamber (PC) could confirm the new structures of public supervisory committees (PSC) in 43 regions of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> If the version put to vote will be adopted, lobbyists of security agencies will increase their influence. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> PSC are public structures that monitor the incarceration conditions in places of detention. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, riots at the Kopeisk penal colony - the majority of resonant events behind bars receive publicity particularly through the PSC. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> There is a battle between human rights activists and lobbyists of security agencies for control over PSC. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> At the meeting of the PC workgroup on forming PSC, I proposed that experience with human rights activity be set as a criterion. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> &quot;They did not accept it, and they generated lists without elaborating criteria,&quot; tells Valeriy Borschev. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Borschev is the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Committee and Association of Independent Observers - the All-Russian organization of human rights activists engaged in prison issues. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> While deputy of the State Duma from &quot;Apple&quot;, he developed a law regulating the activity of PSC. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> The PC council must vote for the structures of PSC in 43 regions of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Less than a thousand hopefuls seek the 1800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria they could not organize competitions due to lack of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The PC promises to organize additional recruitment for the vacant seats. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The Moscow PC is one of a few committees with a competition, despite the fact that instead of 20 there will be 40 participants in the new structure. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> According to Borschev, in the current structure of the capital&apos;s committee are 11 human rights activists and 9 security officials, and in the version that is up for vote in the PC, the ratio is changing to 17 to 23. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Moreover, 30 human rights activists wanted to get on the capital&apos;s committee. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> On the other hand, representative of &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; Vyacheslav Kalinin can once again enter the new structure. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> He was a member of the PSC for three years, but did not once visit prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> Borschev believes that security agencies, by appointing their PSC representative, will be able to make the work of human rights activists unbearable, therefore human rights activists do not rule out a collective withdrawal from the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In their opinion, the advancement of security agencies is coordinated by PSC member Anton Tsvetkov who heads &quot;Officers of Russia&quot; - an organization advocating the interests of security agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> &quot;I don&apos;t eat babies for breakfast,&quot; declared Anton Tsvetkov to RBC daily. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> He denies that he lobbies for the advancement of any kind of lists and says that he does not intend to hinder human rights activists from visiting arrested opposition members. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list they are voting on now in the PC. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> He considers the information publicized by Borschev as a form of pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> A possible success of human rights activists is the planned replacement of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk PSC. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Its former leaders will be dismissed due to last year&apos;s Kopeisk riots. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the Public Chamber they came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local committee ignored the problems of inmates. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> However, the Rostov-on-Don PSC could shift from human rights activists to security agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> The human rights activist-chairman of the local committee &quot;vanished&quot; from the new lists, yet one of his opponents turned up despite the fact that in May of 2013 the federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Borschev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov committees &quot;revenge for Kopeisk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> The denunciation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not influence the Mordovia PSC, which they consider to be &quot;security&quot;: only one human rights activist wanted to make it into the new structure, and they did not even accept her documents for the competition. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> PC council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list because the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don troubles him. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> He circulated his opinion to other members of the council. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> His PC colleague Pavel Gusev says that he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Deputy secretary of the PC Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the Scientific Research Institute for the Federal Corrections Service, coordinated the compilation of the lists of the PSC. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> Grib told RBC Daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights activists and security agencies and does not agree that chairmen of the committees have sufficient authorities to hinder the work of its members. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> Grib declines to forecast the voting results of the PC council. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> If the proposed list today will be rejected, in coming days an amended version will be brought up for a vote. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott&apos;s daughters stood to personally benefit from policies. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> &quot;He&apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he&apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not,&quot; Mr Palmer said. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> Tony Abbott&apos;s daughters Frances and Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting? </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;We need to have a better system,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Why is it that we shouldn&apos;t have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night? </seg>
<seg id="1463"> Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn&apos;t like it? </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take &quot;very seriously&quot; his new job. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Public office is about public service. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> &quot;We seek no reward, except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents </seg>
<seg id="1471"> The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Google is accused of infringing seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google&apos;s search business. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google&apos;s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola&apos;s library of patents. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> &quot;Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe,&quot; the lawsuit said. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google&apos;s patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to host 22 thousand spectators, remarked members of police who attended the meeting of the Control and Disciplinary Committee of the Russian Football Union. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> The ticket program was overrated, in their opinion, approximately twofold. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> During the Russian Cup 1/16 final match against &quot;Spartak&quot;, only a thousand stewards were deployed while the regulatory norm is nine thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> Spartak fans were allocated 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of stadium capacity, however, based on an agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The head of the Control and Disciplinary Committee Artur Grigoryants publicized this data. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild </seg>
<seg id="1489"> A bird airlifted ashore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> The water rail was put on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being nursed back to health by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Centre manager Colin Seddon said: &quot;This water rail was likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1492"> It seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> He added: &quot;It was unable to fly off again so we were contacted for help.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Fines for unauthorized street vending in Vologda to increase severalfold </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Municipal authorities believe that increased fines will help bring order to Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous booths and stalls. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The majority of street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell frequently do not pass health inspections. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> This means that the health of the citizens of Vologda is exposed to danger </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Therefore, the minimum fine imposed on citizens for unauthorized vending will increase sixfold beginning in November, from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, reports the press relations service of the Administration of Vologda. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile factory in Vsevolozhsk. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> As they say in trade unions, all of the dismissed received compensation. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> However, the issue of the reduction of industrial production in the region is becoming much more poignant than the problems of workers. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Deputy of the regional legislative assembly Aleksei Etmanov at a meeting said that they cut around 600 people at the factory of the company Ford in Vsevolozhsk. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> According to him, this occurred as early as September: at that time in line with a program of voluntarily dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, around 600 people resigned from the factory. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Workers who decided to resign voluntarily were offered &quot;golden parachutes&quot; in the amount of several salaries. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Due to that, the overwhelming majority left their jobs voluntarily. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> However, according to Etmanov, such an amount of people is an entire night shift. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> I think that the matter will not be limited to this. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> However, in the coming two years authorities do not plan on undertaking any programs to support regional enterprises that are in a difficult situation,&quot; he explained, adding that when adopting a budget the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large job cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> At Ford, they are not denying nor confirming this information. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> We are awaiting a response from the company, and, as soon as it emerges, we will definitely publicize it. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Talk of cutting workers at the Ford factory in Vsevolozhsk has gone on for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> For example, company plans to dismiss 600 people became known as early as September. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Previously the factory announced a suspension of automobile production. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> The reason they gave at the factory was a drop in demand for Ford automobiles in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> According to Petrostat, results of nine months of 2013 show that the industrial output in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Dmitry Medvedev: RF GDP growth rates are insufficient for growth of the nation </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev regards as insufficient for the RF the growth rates of its GDP and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms for crediting business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovations, reports Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> We planned this year a growth of GDP near 3%, perhaps even a little more. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In reality it will be a little less than 2%. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Against the backdrop of the recession in a wide range of countries of Europe seemingly not too bad, but for us this is little because the economic basis is also not so powerful as in a wide range of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business receive good loans at a good price - this is the first thing that definitely needs to be done,&quot; emphasized the head of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> &quot;Yugra&quot; general manager Andrei Belmach noted that so far it is difficult to say how much time will be needed to search for a new head trainer. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The resignation occurred a few hours ago, therefore I am not ready to say how much time will be needed to search for a new trainer, ITAR-TASS cites Belmach. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Maybe a day. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> Maybe a month. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We are studying all possible options. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> Preference will be given to a Russian specialist. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> It is desired to not merely find some trainer, but the kind of person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results inside it. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A snowboarder was specially photographed for an Olympic banknote </seg>
<seg id="1533"> The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued into circulation a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi where already this winter the Olympics will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> The face value of the banknote is 100 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> But online bloggers are already actively mocking the commemorative banknote. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30 they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in image banks. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Specifically - in the free photo archive StockExchange, where the photo in question is dated 2005. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> That same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website &quot;Megaobzor&quot; on January 18, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> In addition, it was already used in an advertisement for RugGear smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The Olympic banknote was designed in a dark blue-light blue color gamut. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At one side a snowboarder flying over Sochi is displayed,  at the other - the view of an Olympic stadium and the Firebird. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, winner in the competition among students of Saint Petersburg&apos;s Academy of Arts n.a. Repin. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> At the presentation it was noted that several sports were examined - downhill skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end snowboarding was selected since it is a relatively young type of sport. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> According to an &quot;Izvestia&quot; source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to public opinion relating to the wide distribution of an image of a snowboarder from an Olympic banknote and it is now studying the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> However in Gosznak they are not too worried by the buzz surrounding the Olympic banknote. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The head of the press service of Gosznak Natalia Nikiforova told &quot;Izvestia&quot; that all discussions regarding plagiarism are ridiculous. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, on online photographs - to the left, specified Nikiforova. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The person in the photo session to create the banknote was photographed from various points, then the final image was selected, with a typical pose of a snowboarder on it. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote since the artist received payment for the work. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> According to experts, the discussion surrounding the image on the Olympic banknote is entirely positive. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> The recognizability of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, - believes the CEO of NP &quot;RusBrand&quot; Aleksei Popovichev. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> It is rather difficult to prove one hundred percent resemblance of the images on the banknote and in photo banks, therefore claims to dispute intellectual property for this image will unlikely arise. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> The first ever Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative banknote for 10 yuan was issued for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Russia decided to support this tradition. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Fashion week in Sao Paolo. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> Back home they do not consider her merely a model, but a real star. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Despite the fact that Gisele Bundchen left work for some time devoting herself to motherhood, she specially arrived for these days and for this week of fashion parade. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> The several months absence did not hinder her from preserving her place on the podium and on the pedestal. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Gisele remains the highest paid supermodel in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> This time she participated in the fashion parade for the brand &quot;Colcci&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> The finale of fashion week is usually the most interesting exhibits. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Sort of like what stylist Lino Villaventura organized. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The brand is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the production of luxury class ready-to-wear, the designer actively works in theater and in cinema, designing shows and developing costumes for many well-known films. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Altogether, more than 30 thousand firms and companies related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the concluding week of fashion in Sao Paolo. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> This is one of the most dynamically developing spheres of production, more than 2 million Brazilians are engaged in it, and the annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars. </seg>

<seg id="1573"> In Belarus starting in November pensions will be raised </seg>
<seg id="1574"> In Belarus starting in November of this year pensions will be raised, a BELTA correspondent was told at the central administration of pension provision of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Starting on November 1 of this year, there will be an adjustment of the minimum wage of workers in the republic, applied with the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase in its amount by 5.4%, and the corresponding recalculation of work pensions will be done in accordance with decree No.478, dated October 21, 2013, &quot;On raising pensions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> As a result of the recalculation, starting in November work retirement pensions will be increased, based on an estimate, by an average of 5.3%. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The average retirement pension will equal Br 2 million 295 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Expenditures of the Social Security Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security of Belarus toward payment of pensions in the increased amounts starting in November of this year will increase by Br 274.3 billion per month. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> At the same time as the recalculation of work pensions in November of this year will also be recalculated the minimum and social pensions, bonuses, raises and additional payments to pensions in connection with the increased minimum living budget on average per capita. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The minimum living budget for the period from November 1 2013 through January 31 2014 was confirmed by the government at the amount of Br 1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one that was in effect during the period from August 1 through October 31. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Accordingly, the sizes of minimal work pensions, social pensions and bonuses, raises and additional payments to pensions will be increased by 2.1% starting on November 1. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> In Belarus more than Br 53 trillion has been secured for payment of pensions with allowance for the raises in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> NSA Blames &quot;Internal Error,&quot; Not Hackers, For Website Crash </seg>
<seg id="1585"> The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> &quot;NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The issue will be resolved this evening. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA&apos;s website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency&apos;s internal, sensitive network was &quot;not at all&quot; compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight&apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> Gazprom&apos;s Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era </seg>
<seg id="1598"> The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe&apos;s largest energy projects, Gazprom&apos;s chief said. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> &quot;A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia&apos;s export routes through Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia&apos;s gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year&apos;s end. </seg>

<seg id="1607"> The agency &quot;Rosbalt&quot; was deprived of media status for obscenity </seg>
<seg id="1608"> On October 31 the Moscow Municipal Court resolved to annul the license of registration of the agency &quot;Rosbalt&quot;, writes &quot;Lenta&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status for systematic and blatant violations of the law on mass media. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> A disagreeable precedent was created during the trial: the court considered it feasible to close the media outlet, virtually depriving the agency of the right to put forth counterarguments. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> What is &quot;Rosbalt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Closed joint-stock company &quot;Information Agency Rosbalt&quot; was founded in Saint Petersburg in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> In subsequent years the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Also with the agency operate representative offices in countries of the former USSR. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Since 2001 &quot;Rosbalt&quot; has developed and functioned as a federal informational-analytical agency. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> By the middle of the 2000&apos;s the agency was entered into the list of the most recognizable private Internet media resources in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Moreover, &quot;Rosbalt&quot; always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive publications of the agency composed (and compose to this day) news items with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Conversations about the proximity of the publication to security structures continued throughout the existence of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> While &quot;Rosbalt&quot; possessed an extensive base of sources in various agencies, the fact that Natalya Chaplina - wife of Victor Cherkesov - stood at the head of the project also spoke in favor of such assumptions. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Moreover, the role of Chaplina in the management of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is not fully clear: most commonly they call her &quot;project manager&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, chief editor - Nikolai Ulyanov. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Recently &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not figure in the ratings of federal media resources - not by citation, not by audience. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In October the agency occupied 25th place in the visibility rating of websites of Russian media based on the version of LiveInternet. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Based on that same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosbalt.ru amounts to approximately 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - approximately three million unique visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> In the list of the most popular materials over the last five months - news items on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relation to Ukraine, death of the soloist of the group &quot;King and Fool&quot;, pogroms in the capital&apos;s Biryulevo. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The conflict of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; with Roskomnadzor began in July of 2013 when amendments to the law on media prohibiting journalists from obscenities took effect. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The agency discovered prohibited vocabulary in two video clips published on the website of the agency (&quot;The horseman from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;Pussy Riot desecrated oil derricks&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1628"> What came next the parties describe differently. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Based on the discovered video materials, Roskomnadzor accused &quot;Rosbalt&quot; of blatant and systematic violation of the law on media and took legal action demanding to take away the agency&apos;s license. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> At &quot;Rosbalt&quot; they declared that the claims of the agency were unjustified: firstly, the clips were not editorial materials, secondly, the obscenities in them were masked, and, thirdly, the clips were removed from the website immediately after the warning. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in a magistrate court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow Municipal Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, examination of those complaints still continued. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> However, already on the 25th the magistrate judge reached a decision not in favor of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;: chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each clip. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Evidently this is what predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow Municipal Court - if we dismiss the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> On October 31 the court reached a decision to annul the certificate of registration of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;, in effect depriving the agency of the status of a media outlet. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> It cannot be said that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; over the course of this confrontation was all alone. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> Deputies of the State Duma supported the agency (a declaration addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation). </seg>
<seg id="1637"> The unlawfulness of closing the publication was declared by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with certain guarantees that the matter will not go as far as revocation of the license. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The trial of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; demonstrated: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be for a media outlet in Russia today is a huge question. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> The speech gene has turned out to be a stimulator for the formation of synapses </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Scientists from John Hopkins University and the School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have discovered a protein thanks to which the &quot;speech gene&quot; Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The research has been published in Science, and its abstract can be read on the journal&apos;s website. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> Its role was able to be established in 2001 owing to the discovery of a family of several people who could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes even they themselves did not understand each other. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Scientists ascertained that in members of the family the activity of the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted, though the manner in which it performs its function remained unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> In new research, biologists have shown that Foxp2 performs at least a portion of its functions as a simulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> It does this owing to another gene, SRPX2. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, whereas only Foxp2 influences its activity. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The fact that SRPX2 actually influences vocalization was confirmed by scientists in an experiment on mice. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> When the activity of the gene was artificially reduced in the animals, they screamed less when separated from mother. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of emitted sounds also was restored. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Previously interconnection between vocalization and Foxp2 itself was also demonstrated on mice. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Animals in which a human copy of the gene was introduced peeped more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Thus far, however, scientists do not know whether the function of Foxp2 and, consequently, of SRPX2 controlled by it, is linked with the purely &quot;mechanical&quot; properties of the formation of sounds or with more subtle processes. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Ponomarev left &quot;A Just Russia&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1657"> State Duma deputy from the party &quot;A Just Russia&quot;, member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted a notice of resignation from the political organization. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> As the parliamentarian announced, he submitted the notice to the Novosibirsk regional division of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the &quot;Just Russians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> We sit, we drink tea... </seg>
<seg id="1661"> &quot;For some reason many want to see the picture &quot;Ilya Ponomarev places his party membership card on the table&quot;, but there is nothing so epochal in this,&quot; the deputy commented his decision. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Ponomarev noted that he maintains a good relationship with the regional division of &quot;Just Russians&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up the mandate of State Duma deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> He explained that despite leaving the party, he will remain a member of the faction and by law cannot leave it. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Reports of the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party &quot;A Just Russia&quot; emerged on October 30. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> It was reported that Dimitry Gudkov and Valeriy Zubov would leave &quot;JR&quot; together with him, however the latter quickly refuted that information. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream? </seg>
<seg id="1668"> A British entrepreneur has created the world&apos;s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> The ice cream reacts with the eater&apos;s tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Charlie, founder of the &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious&quot; ice cream company, said: &quot;It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> So each scoop costs me around £140. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> It tastes pretty good though. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Charlie&apos;s experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> He said: &quot;I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1683"> It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists </seg>
<seg id="1685"> GM recalls some new pickup trucks in U.S. to fix seatbacks </seg>
<seg id="1686"> General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> &quot;If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury,&quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> GM&apos;s truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> A pedestrian zone was opened near Tretyakov Gallery </seg>
<seg id="1698"> A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> It is located near Tretyakov Gallery and occupies an area two kilometers from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to Bolotnaya Square. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Street lamps, florists, benches, trash bins and toilets have been installed along its entire length, blind fences and illegal advertisements have been cleared. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky Lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to vehicles - Ordynsky Cul-de-sac, Bolshoy and Maliy Tolmachevskiy Lanes, Kadashevskaya Embankment and Bolotnaya Square. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Traffic on Maroseika and Petrovka Streets are not restricted. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> In the area of Pyatnitskaya Street from the entrance hall of Novokuznetskaya station to Klimentovsky Lane, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing traffic and reducing the roadway, reports newsmsk.com. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Tretyakov Gallery, Church of the Holy Martyr Clement Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other sights ended up within the pedestrian zone. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Previously, Tverskoy Passage, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Most Street became fully pedestrian. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> Bolshaya Dmitrovka, where a pedestrian zone was opened in early September, was decided to be closed to vehicles on weekends and holidays. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Zenit fans on the official site of the club declared the former captain of Team Russia as the best player of the past month. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> In October, Arshavin took part in two matches in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, three meets at the Russian championships and in a cup match. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> He scored 2 assists. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Second place based on monthly results went to goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin, who became the best player of August and September. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The forward Khalk is in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The Brazilian scored two goals and three assists. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Let us recall that Arshavin returned to &quot;Zenit&quot; this summer. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> A series of premiere &quot;Art-mainstream&quot; film screenings will take place in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="1715"> A series of &quot;Art-mainstream&quot; film screenings, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films several days before they are released, will take place in the &quot;Rolan&quot; movie theater from the 1st through the 5th of November, reports RIA &quot;Novosti&quot; citing the project organizers. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> The French comedy from director and actress Reem Kherici &quot;Paris At All Costs&quot; will open the &quot;Art-mainstream&quot; program. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> This is the story of a model Maya (Kherici herself) working in the French capital who is deported back home to Morocco due to visa problems. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> In addition to the film of Kherici, viewers will be shown a new film from the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk &quot;Moebius&quot;, the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirschbiegel &quot;Diana: Love Story&quot; (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of Cannes Film Festival held last May, Abdellatif Kechiche&apos;s &quot;Life of Adele&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> The only Russian participant of &quot;Art-mainstream&quot; will be the winner of the Kinotavr festival, the film of Alexander Veledinsky &quot;The Geographer Drank His Globe Away&quot; based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> The lead role of a charming unsuccessful teacher Victor Sluzhkin was played in the film by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was distinguished with the &quot;Kinotavr&quot; prize. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Snowden ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany over US surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: &quot;Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1725"> However, speaking the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela&apos;s Merkel&apos;s phone. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US,&quot; it should be taken. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany&apos;s Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor&apos;s lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, the MP said. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a &quot;severe and sustained&quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo &quot;genuineness&quot; test </seg>
<seg id="1740"> A &quot;genuineness&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government&apos;s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&apos;s neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> &quot;Loud declarations about &apos;foreigners getting to the back of the queue&apos; and &apos;Aussie jobs first&apos; are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Immigration Minister Brendan O&apos;Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> If the &quot;genuineness&quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about &quot;whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The man&apos;s distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> The head trainer of &quot;Colorado&quot; Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to unleash goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov in the first minutes in the final match with &quot;Dallas&quot;, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars has not shaken his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas staff reporter from &quot;Sport Express&quot; Natalia Shmeleva. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> But what should we expect, said Roy after the morning skate of the &quot;Avalanches&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> We want him to get out on the ice and demonstrate his usual level. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> In other words, you are completely confident that the situation in no way has affected the performance of the goalkeeper? </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Well today we will see. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Without a doubt our players will support Varly in that they will help him protect the goal, as was the case in the previous matches of this season. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Above all, no one on the team intends to draw any kind of conclusions until the court investigates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Baumgertner was nominated for the board of directors of Uralkali </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The acting board of directors of open joint-stock company Uralkali proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk general director Vladislav Baumgertner for the new board membership, as reported on the website of the Russian company. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Baumgertner was entered into a list of 11 persons nominated for the new board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29 at which the new structure of the board of directors will be determined by vote. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Presently, Baumgertner is under house arrest in Minsk. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> During the arrest in August of this year, he was arraigned for abuse of official powers. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> However, later the president of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko announced at a press conference that the accusations against Baumgertner were requalified as &quot;embezzlement&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The European Union has a backup plan to supply Ukraine with gas and to reach an agreement with the IMF for an emergency loan if Russia undertakes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> Negotiations are being conducted with the IMF for a standby loan, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has stated that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could also receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> Analysts surveyed by Reuters have doubts about whether Ukraine and the IMF can overcome their longstanding disagreements regarding the terms of financing. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> Another organization that doubts the possibility of enacting the reforms required for such assistance is the international rating agency S&amp;P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine&apos;s sovereign credit rating by one level, from B to B-. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> However, representatives of the EU are saying that the IMF may show some flexibility in their loan terms after taking into account Ukraine&apos;s circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> In addition to its plan to support the country financially, the EU has a backup option to supply Ukraine with gas, most deliveries of which are currently coming from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> This could possibly include gas from Nord Stream or reverse deliveries from Slovakia. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> According to officials, the latter option above would be the most feasible and acceptable method in case Russia &quot;isolates&quot; Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Analysts believe that such a method involving reverse deliveries to Ukraine could only be used for a few weeks and would likely lead to reduced deliveries to other regions. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> &quot;EU countries and the Ukrainians are conducting negotiations on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine could import gas from other sources instead of Russia, or from the same source but via other delivery routes,&quot; noted a source from Reuters. </seg>

<seg id="1783"> After the match, the commuter train will deliver the fans back to Moscow - it will depart from Khimki station at 18:53. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Let us recall that the match &quot;Dynamo&quot; - &quot;Tom&quot; will begin on November 2 at 16:00 Moscow time. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> Sovsport.ru will run its text ticker. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> In the U.S. it will be possible to use mobile devices during airplane takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> New rules for safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, reports the telecorporation BBC. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> As expected, American airline companies will permit passengers to use smartphones and tablets during the entire flight, the new rules will take effect by the end of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Nonetheless, Internet connection to receive and send email will be prohibited during flights at a height lower than 3 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Due to the danger of the emergence of interference of radio equipment of planes, cellular voice communications will be banned as before. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> Thus, aircraft passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to test the safety of using electronic devices during a flight. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In addition, airline companies will have to convince the U.S. federal aviation administration that they will be able to handle the presumptive impact of mobile devices on aviation equipment and airplane control devices. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> According to a source, based on the U.S. example, in Great Britain it will also be possible to revise current norms for using electronic devices during flights. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Runner on the field during the &quot;Shinnik&quot; match </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Certain details have become known about the identity of the fan who ran onto the field during the Russian Cup 1/16 final match between Yaroslavl&apos;s &quot;Shinnik&quot; and Moscow&apos;s &quot;Spartak&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> As the head of CDC RFU Artur Grigoryants stated  referring to data from the Interior Ministry, the fan is a Muscovite. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> He is currently detained. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> &quot;In addition, Grigoryants told of how the fan managed to burst onto the field: &quot;It emerged that this, let&apos;s call him spectator, got through to an ambulance in the accompaniment of two spectators citing heart problems. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> He approached the ambulance - the ambulance doctor confirmed this to us. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> And then he pushed away the two companions and ran to the field. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern stands to the corner of the Eastern and Northern stands. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> He ran across the entire field. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The stewards are responsible for this. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Before the law on sports goes into effect, this is the zone of operations of stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> He ran to the stands, climbed over the Eastern stands. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> And at that time disruptions began in the Eastern stands and on the running lanes,&quot; stated the head of the CDC. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Let us recall that by decision of the CDC Moscow&apos;s &quot;Spartak&quot; will play the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championships against &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; and &quot;Zenit&quot; without spectators, and will pay a fine in the amount of 600 thousand rubles. </seg>

<seg id="1811"> Yulia vacations in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiance - figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Photos from joint strolls of the pairs were published on the Instagram of Anastasia Zadorozhnaya. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> This is not the first joint photo of Andrei and Yulia. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> On October 5 Zadorozhnaya published a photo on which the pair stands embraced on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> In mid-October the halfback of &quot;Zenit&quot; Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his common-law wife Yulia. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Let us recall that Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin were together since 2003, they have three children. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating former model Alisa Kazmina. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The new girlfriend of Arshavin had been married to a corporate executive. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The RF president created a separate ministry for construction, housing and public utilities </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Russian president Vladimir Putin created a new ministry overseeing issues of construction and housing and public utilities and recommended former governor of Ivanov region Mikhail Men to head it during a personal meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The president met with Mikhail Men at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new agency. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions concerning construction and housing and public utilities will pass to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Mikhail Men is the son of a well-known eastern orthodox minister archpriest Alexander Men, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry n.a. Gubkin. </seg>

<seg id="1825"> From 2005 through October 16, 2013 Mikhail Men was governor of Ivanov region. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> Americans eavesdropped on high-ranking Japanese officials </seg>
<seg id="1827"> On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of American intelligence agencies who preferred to not disclose his name, claimed that the United States eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of high-ranking officials of Japan. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several sites intended for eavesdropping. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Moreover, he noted that the U.S.A., Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand do not conduct reconnaissance operations against each other. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> According to him, such was formed during the Second World War when these countries were allies. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> However, Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for reconnaissance operations, reported the television channel NHK. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> Let us recall that news of surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies against the chancellor of Germany emerged last week. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> According to data from German journalists, the NSA could have wiretapped the telephone of Merkel over a period of the last ten years. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretaps rather painfully. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> She declared that such surveillance of a head of government by allies, who, according to her, Germany and the United States have been for decades, is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Meanwhile, Edward Snowden declared that he is ready to share details about the wiretapping of telephone conversations of Angela Merkel with employees of the German prosecutor&apos;s office. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> A German specially flew to Moscow in order to meet with the former CIA employee. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> A scandalous video has made its way to the police </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, well-known for his scandals and openly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> The police of the Canadian city has announced that it possesses the corresponding video recording and is prepared to begin an investigation on the city&apos;s mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> CNN reports that the latter declared that he will not resign from his post . </seg>
<seg id="1843"> Information that authorities have proof of consumption of narcotics by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police website. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The head of local law enforcement agencies Bill Blair held a press conference on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The sheriff said that he is not authorized to share the particular video clips with the public, however he guarantees their existence. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> According to Blair, the compromising video of Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-narcotics raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, however until recently there had been no confirmations. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> The mayor himself does not provide any comments on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> He only says that he is not guilty of anything and does not intend to resign. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The video recording discovered by the police is one piece of evidence in the case of the 35-year-old friend of Ford, Alexander Lisi, who is accused of soft narcotics dealing, extortion, illegall income acquisition, as well as criminal conspiracy. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> At times Lisi served as the driver of Rob Ford. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> City residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> The latter repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public while drunk, took the liberty of making racist and sexist statements. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Diana Arbenina does not hide what a huge pleasure she receives from upbringing her children. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Despite the fact that right now Arbenina spends an especially large amount of time on creative work and social activity, she nonetheless finds the opportunity to busy oneself with Marta and Artyom, and not only spends time on their education, but also entertains them however possible. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Over the past week Diana twice provided an account of her pedagogical talents in front of her admirers. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> At first she put out on Facebook a picture on which it is visible how she is teaching her children to read. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> And yesterday she spoiled her fans with showing how she dressed up Artyom and Marta for Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Ready for the broom races! our first Halloween&quot; - so named Diana the picture of her children dressed in holiday costumes. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Which is no wonder, after all they, like no other Russian little boys and little girls, bear a relation to this holiday since they were born in America. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31 near the city of Kokimbo in the central part of Chile, reports the agency Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, as specified on the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Tremors were registered at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 Moscow time). </seg>
<seg id="1865"> So far nothing is being reported regarding victims or destruction caused by the underground tremors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Let us recall that Chile is located on one of the most seismically active regions of Earth, therefore earthquakes of various intensity there are not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> One of the most serious occurred in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> At that time, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 and the tsunami it caused resulted in the death of 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Moreover, the most powerful earthquake in modern history occurred in Chile: in 1960 a magnitude of 9.5 was registered there. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> More than five thousand people perished as a result of that natural disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Open joint-stock company Rostovaeroinvest declared the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner in the tender to select the general designer of a facility. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> At Rostovaeroinvest they are not disclosing the contract amount. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Based on information from the press service of the open joint-stock company, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the tender, and according to the terms of the tender the design must be prepared and submitted for state expert review in the spring of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal for the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and landscaping for the airport complex. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> During the first phase of construction, the interior area of the terminal will amount to 50 thousand square meters, with its possible future expansion. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Based on data from Rostovaeroinvest, prospects for development of the airport complex will be taken into account in the design project: by 2025 the terminal will be capable of providing service to around 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> By the time the tender results were tallied, the architectural concept of the &quot;Yuzhniy&quot; air terminal complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been determined. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> The design for the main terminal building embodies the concept of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience implementing large-scale projects, the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new air terminal complex at &quot;Knevichi&quot; international airport in Vladivostok. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> The Yuzhniy international airport complex will be built in the Aksaysky district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and ultimately integrated into urban development. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The start of construction of the air terminal complex is planned for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Experienced Italian workers make way for the young </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Italian unemployment is breaking records. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Data published Wednesday showed that now 12.5% of country residents are unemployed. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Situation has not been this bad since the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> This indicator is several times higher among the youth. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> 40.4% of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 years have no employment. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> According to Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of elderly workers. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Such an experiment is already being conducted by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide for a portion of early retirement for experienced workers. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> However, on the other hand, the common European problem of an aging population awaits Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> And economists are not sure that the plan with premature rotation of staff is paying off. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Syria destroyed all declared capacities for production of chemical weapons, acknowledged the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This first phase of disarmament Damascus completed the day before the established deadline. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Before November 1 Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for preparing chemical warfare agents for use, reports the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Destruction of the stocks of poisonous substances themselves or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> According to a representative of OPCW, currently the poisonous agents are located in sealed depots. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> International inspectors headed to Syria after, according to the U.S., more than 1,400 people died during a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> The main objective of the inspectors was to not lose time - in order to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and loading ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> Now they will attentively observe these production capacities in order to not allow their repair. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The next milestone - mid-November: by that time the OPCW and Syrians must agree to a detailed plan for destroying the already existing stocks of poisonous substances. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> There are many questions here. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where will they be destroyed? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will provide equipment for this? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All Syrian declarations will be thoroughly checked by western intelligence agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They will readily recommend to the inspectors new facilities for inspection if there will be reasons to suspect that Damascus is not fully forthcoming. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The U.S. believes that this bombardment was conducted by regular troops. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia insist that it is the work of Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The world community required from Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement achieved through the mediation of Russia, - to destroy or disable all capacities for the production of rounds, poisonous gases and liquids and for loading rounds with those substances. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now, when this phase is over, the next step must be to destroy the chemical weapons already existing in the Syrian army. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is assumed that in this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of neuroparalytic poisonous substances, skin blistering mustard gas and other banned chemical substances stored in several dozen different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> For its destruction it is essential that the OPCW and Syrian authorities for a start agree on a schedule of actions - two weeks are allocated for this. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The supervisor of field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally observed the destruction of equipment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;They now have no capability to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The statement of the OPCW says that inspectors visited 21 of 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that factories producing rounds and poisonous substances either were destroyed or disabled. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct an inspection there, it says in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was &quot;especially difficult&quot; since it was necessary to work under conditions of an ongoing conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> In the beginning of October the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, so far inspectors found no time to celebrate this - they were too busy with work. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Another day, another independence scare story. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Since Scotland isn&apos;t in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So, a non-story, then. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; canard at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe&apos;s bidding, anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why trade London&apos;s yoke for that of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September&apos;s federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer&apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we&apos;ve already seen at Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> All the wage freezes in the world won&apos;t stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU&apos;s main cheerleader. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> Result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can&apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use next year&apos;s EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here&apos;s my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The EU won&apos;t disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot;Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations&quot; favoured by General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> However, Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Where does this leave Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour&apos;s chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Australian woman appeals Thai jail time </seg>
<seg id="1968"> A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> She was held in local police cells before the court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women&apos;s jail. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Tunks told Sydney&apos;s Sunday Telegraph the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about his daughter&apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;It&apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we&apos;re hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The first boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="1982"> On October 23 the opening of the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev took place in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to a wide audience for his magnificent products made from luxury fur. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> And now even more fashion worshipers will be able to value them - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, for the occasion of which the designer threw a party in dolce vita style. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> I am certain that the most beautiful women live in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> For that reason I am especially happy that my store opened in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> It is not merely an office, but a place where there really is a part of me. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Precisely with these words Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all who wished... to try on appealing models! </seg>

<seg id="1991"> We are very happy that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and domains. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> Belarus on its part is also interested in this, therefore we agreed that the government administration agencies of the two countries will provide ubiquitous assistance and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves,&quot; noted Vladimir Makei. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> He underscored that the government of Belarus will create for that all necessary conditions and provide maximal assistance. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The minister also reported that in Ankara was held the scheduled 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic committee according to the results of which a protocol was signed. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> The parties worked out a roadmap of Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and economic and investment domains, in spheres of industrial cooperation, transportation, agriculture, energy, as well as a search for new forms and areas of interaction. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> &quot;The protocol of the last meeting was fulfilled in full, and I am convinced that the current protocol also will be fulfilled, because Belarus and Turkey see each other as reliable partners,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> The minister of foreign affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutogu in turn reported that at the successful negotiations the heads of the foreign policy agencies of the two countries decided to also further develop mutually advantageous cooperation and implement various projects. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> According to the minister, it is necessary to increase the trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, and drive it to an indicator of $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Also Turkey is an important partner in the sphere of investment cooperation, which is necessary to develop further as well, since in this sphere there is unused potential, he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> Relations between our countries were always very warm, and we hope that in the future they will strengthen and expand even more. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> And also all necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will be created,&quot; noted Ahmet Davutoglu. </seg>

<seg id="2022"> On October 31 Barnaul police discovered two gambling halls. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The first one operated in the Industrial district on Vzletnaya street. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> A game was underway in the facility during the inspection. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> There were 24 machines in the club. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Another gambling club was discovered in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov street. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here they used 20 gambling machines. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> The Barnaul administration of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs reports that administrative materials have been compiled based on the article &quot;Unlawfully organizing and conducting gambling&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Equipment was confiscated. </seg>

<seg id="2032"> Private companies possessing their own computerized motordrome will be able to hold exams for drivers&apos; licenses. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> This is reported by &quot;Kommersant&quot; citing the draft government resolution &quot;On permission to drive vehicles&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> As the newspaper writes, currently in Russia there are only around 30 such motordromes. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> It is assumed that the results of internal testing will be counted for students of such &quot;privileged&quot; driving schools. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> Moreover, every six months the State Automobile Inspectorate will monitor the passing of examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> If it turns out that students do not pass more than 30% of exams on theory and more than 20% ground exams on the first try, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months. </seg>

<seg id="2043"> Early puberty: Growing older sooner </seg>
<seg id="2044"> African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Physical changes don&apos;t mean puberty is imminent </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There&apos;s no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="2048"> The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> &quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> &quot;Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;precocious&quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child&apos;s age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Psychosocial aspects are important, too. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, &quot;suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls&apos; feelings of being different from peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2065"> The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don&apos;t want their very young daughters having periods. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> &quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Yet, there&apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are varying explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> &quot;We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation,&quot; Kaplowitz advised. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The head of Dagestan hears notes of extremism in the hymn of Kuban </seg>
<seg id="2088"> The football match between &quot;Anzhi&quot; and &quot;Kuban&quot; resulted in a political conflict between authorities of Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the hymn of Kuban began to sound different. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday motioned Republic parliament members to take legal action because the hymn of Krasnodar Territory supposedly resounds with appeals for interethnic discord, in particular calls for war with &quot;infidels&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Take the hymn of Krasnodar Territory, they approved this hymn in our generation in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> This is a shame, and no one is taking this up. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;About you here remembering, like about native mother, to the enemy, to the infidel we go for mortal combat&quot; - why write such words in a hymn, bait some believers against other believers,&quot; chairman of parliament Khizri Shikhsaidov expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> RBS suspends two forex traders </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> Some of the world&apos;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world&apos;s largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> &quot;Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Mr Usher&apos;s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland&apos;s competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> Banks are scouring through years&quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks&apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks&quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot;you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained,&quot; Credit Suisse said. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> Supreme Court upholds Obama health care law </seg>
<seg id="2115"> In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama&apos;s signature health care law is constitutional. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law&apos;s requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> The law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney. </seg>

<seg id="2140"> On November 4, on National Unity Day, the Russian march approved by the mayor&apos;s office will take place in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> According to a survey by &quot;Levada-center&quot;, support of &quot;Russian marches&quot; is growing - already 40% of citizens to various degrees approve the idea of their implementation. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> According to &quot;Levada-center&quot;, 40% of citizens to various degrees approve the staging of &quot;Russian marches&quot;: of them 11% perceive such actions definitively positive and 29% - &quot;mostly positive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> The popularity of the idea of &quot;Russian marches&quot; is gradually growing - in 2006 only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, but in December of 2010 already twice as many citizens (28%) supported the staging of such events. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Only 7% of Russians perceive the &quot;Russian marches&quot; &quot;definitively negative&quot;, &quot;mostly negative&quot; - 19%. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Another 35% could not formulate their stance on this action. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> This year, the mayor of Moscow approved the staging of the &quot;Russian march&quot; numbering up to 15 thousand people in Lyublino, this was reported today by the head of the capital&apos;s security department Aleksei Mayorov. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> This action of nationalists takes place every year on National Unity Day since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> In response to the question of sociologists &quot;Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia &quot;Russian marches&quot; are carried out under slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia? three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Now only every fifth Russian (20%) knows about this action. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is noteworthy that in December of 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) had heard about the &quot;Russian marches&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Let us recall that three years ago on December 11 on Manezhnaya Square there was a spontaneous rally of nationalists that degenerated into mass riots. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> &quot;Levada-center&quot; also asked Russians about which holiday is celebrated on November 4. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> In two years the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> However, only 15% of citizens intend to celebrate this holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> Approximately just as many (17%) intend to celebrate November 7 October Revolution Day. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> Most citizens (62%) do not intend to celebrate any one of these holidays. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> How the mayor&apos;s office approved the &quot;Russian march&quot; in Lyublino </seg>
<seg id="2158"> On October 28 the capital&apos;s authorities approved the staging of a &quot;Russian march&quot; on November 4 in Lyublino. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> This was reported by the leader of the &quot;Russians&quot; association, march organizer Dmitry Demushkin. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Besides the procession in Lyublino, on National Unity Day a rally and rock concert by the group &quot;Kolovrat&quot; will take place, also approved by authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> How &quot;Russian march-2012&quot; went </seg>

<seg id="2166"> A letter from the former CIA employee to German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Stroebele, through whom Snowden forwarded a message to German authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> Stroebele met with Snowden in Moscow the day before. </seg>

<seg id="2170"> Thus, after merging with the city hospital there emerged a greater opportunity to attract specialized experts from the State Healthcare Institution &quot;NGKB&quot; for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations based in a hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> During implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical resources of the maternity clinic were significantly improved, modern equipment compliant with world standards emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> Over these years nearly 8 million rubles were allocated for capital repairs of rooms, 112 units of equipment were acquired for a total of 42 million rubles. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The intensive care unit for newborns is equipped with the most modern equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> In the operating room when conducting Cesarean sections they use a &quot;Cell Saver&quot; machine that makes it possible to collect blood from an operating wound and after special treatment return it to the birthing mother, avoiding transfusion of allogenic blood. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Foreign travelers will be permitted to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand American dollars per year. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars they acquired in the country when departing. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The precise rate of bolivars against the dollar will be established later. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> However, on the black market one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Since the start of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> In September, inflation in Venezuela amounted to almost 50 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The minister of the oil industry and vice president of economics Rafael Ramirez on October 18 announced that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> According to unofficial data, which the agency cited, Caracas could nonetheless decide to reduce the rate of the national currency after municipal elections in December. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> The policy of restraining prices on products and goods of mass consumption, as well as the high level of over-regulation of the Venezuelan economy have led to a deficit of a number of goods and to the functioning of a black currency market. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> In the spring of this year, mass media reported that a shortage of toilet paper was noted in Venezuela. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> John Kerry says US spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately&quot; in unprecedented admission </seg>
<seg id="2199"> John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S&apos;s defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The Secretary of State also admitted that he&apos;d been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA&apos;s spying activities emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2203"> He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one&apos;s rights had been abused. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> He said: &quot;In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2205"> And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> He added: &quot;We&apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens? </seg>
<seg id="2211"> We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we&apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> &quot;It&apos;s really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors,&quot; Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And I&apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency&apos;s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it&apos;s commonplace on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> He said the itinerary is still being worked out. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some &quot;tough love&quot; will also be dispensed. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they&apos;ve used for years themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> &quot;While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we&apos;re not the only ones that are out there spying,&quot; Murphy said. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In the U.S. a school principal shot at teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Teenagers literally drove a principal of one American high school to desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The man, according to him, was compelled to take up a weapon and begin to shoot. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> As the New York Post writes, the juvenile hooligans rolled the man&apos;s house with toilet paper. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Because of this, the school principal opened fire on the teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several wounds in the leg and arm. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Since the hooligans were not on the territory of the principal&apos;s property, he was charged with aggravated assault. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> The man was released on bail of $125 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Let us note that the shooting of civilians in the U.S. is becoming a frightening regularity. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Literally the day before a man opened fire directly at passersby on the street in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the American state of California. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Afterwards, the criminal took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of a car and attempted to escape. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Previously in an elementary school of the city of Newtown, state of Connecticut, a shooting occurred. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mother of Adam worked in the school, she was a teacher. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Shooting in an American school: a 14-year-old girl was wounded </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 in an American school, this time in Atlanta (state of Georgia). </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Two people were injured: a 14-year-old schoolgirl and teacher. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> China plea paper &apos;to be overhauled&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2243"> A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Now the New Express is to undergo &quot;full rectification,&quot; the regulator said. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The &quot;rectification&quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group&apos;s New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> &quot;New Express&apos;s editorial management was disordered,&quot; the regulator said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> It said it had decided to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter&apos;s license.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2251"> It had also &quot;instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express&apos;s leadership team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> &quot;In this case I&apos;ve caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public&apos;s trust,&quot; he told state broadcaster CCTV. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> I&apos;ve realised my wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Following Mr Chen&apos;s apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Due to mischief of evil spirits several schools and a hospital had to be closed </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Four schools in the Zimbabwean province Southern Matabeleland had to be closed because students were attacked by... goblins. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> As the local elder recounted, children fell into panic, and it proved impossible to continue studies. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The story of goblins may sound like the fabrication of a child for a European, however in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing a school. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Adults also fear evil spirits. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> In summer, for example, in Zimbabwe a hospital was closed because goblins also attacked medical personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> Fire crews called to rescue lost puppy after she got stuck 50ft above the ground on precarious ledge in a quarry </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash </seg>
<seg id="2269"> She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death </seg>
<seg id="2271"> A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: &apos;She was in a precarious situation. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> But she is fine now. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> She was eating biscuits afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> This was a very unusual call-out. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby had a very lucky escape.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;Watching the rescue was terrifying.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2288"> I could not believe that she was up there in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> It was amazing to get her back in our arms. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> The vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The firefighters were amazing. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> It was really daring what they did. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: &quot;We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The firefighters were brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> I just can&apos;t believe where she was. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> Thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet? </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Flight Centre seem to be bucking the trend. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the $305 million to $315 million it previously forecast. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $290.4 million profit it achieved in 2011/12. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-business travel. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> &quot;Year-to-date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically our largest profit generators. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> In Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre&apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Its US business had recovered its losses during its seasonally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Flight Centre shares were up 3c at $38.20 yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers </seg>
<seg id="2310"> Operation of the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyber attack, reports the agency&apos;s press office. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> According to the vice chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for informational and administrative issues Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the website was simply overloaded with a large number of requests. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Our specialists quickly fixed everything, at this time operation of the site has been restored. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;The damage inflicted on the ministry is minimal,&quot; Peterkop said to the publication Postimees. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> According to Peterkop, so far it is early to talk about who organized the attacks. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and we will draw conclusions from that, but it is impossible to completely prevent similar incidents,&quot; he admitted. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Let us recall that on November 1 the group Anonymous Ukraine posted an online message in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> We want the leaders of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> We must not be servants of NATO. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of member countries of NATO. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> Ukraine does not need the NATO alliance. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Ukraine does not need the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> Ukraine does not need Russia either. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Ukraine must not be anyone&apos;s slave. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> We stand for an independent Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> &quot;Hands off Ukraine,&quot; it says in the announcement of Anonymous. </seg>

<seg id="2329"> &quot;We would like to openly exchange opinions on issues of further development of political dialog, discuss issues related to concluding a peaceful agreement,&quot; Kisida announced at the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the RF will accommodate Japan in resolving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Conclusion of a peaceful agreement between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of the disputed Northern territories. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In connection with this, protest actions demanding to give back the country lands lost after the Second World War are taking place in Tokyo today. </seg>

<seg id="2336"> Halloween 2013: By the Numbers </seg>
<seg id="2337"> When I was little, Halloween was magical. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Nowadays, I&apos;ve become more of a scrooge. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> I haven&apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won&apos;t this year. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But stats show that I&apos;m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Women don&apos;t have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I&apos;ll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> I guess there&apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> That&apos;s a lot of ironic hotdog dogs. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> When it comes to candy, we don&apos;t screw around. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> That&apos;s around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> That&apos;s great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> The one thing we don&apos;t want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> That&apos;s about 9 billion individual kernels of corn. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> It&apos;s a mystery I have yet to solve. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> They have the best names, like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which, by the way is in an actual prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can&apos;t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot;nice face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2364"> Finally, let&apos;s talk pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it&apos;s something we&apos;ve done since we were little. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Lucky for us, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin trend&quot; started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> If you&apos;re looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;Bavaria&quot; defender David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, reports the official website of the bundesliga. </seg>

<seg id="2381"> Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger&apos;s 2004 song &quot;Old Habits Die Hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that &quot;he hit on me when I was 18.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2384"> She added, &quot;That was a long time ago, and he&apos;s been very kind.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2385"> In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, says he &quot;categorically denies that he has ever made a pass at Katy Perry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The rep adds: &quot;Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2388"> Her new album, &quot;Prism,&quot; debuted at No. 1 this week. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found </seg>
<seg id="2390"> One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel&apos;s discovery, according to court records. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico&apos;s marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers. </seg>

<seg id="2403"> The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family&apos;s attorney said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Lowndes County sheriff&apos;s investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old&apos;s family disputes that. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> &quot;They absolutely think their son was murdered,&quot; Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> &quot;They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,&quot; Crump said. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son&apos;s death. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> &quot;They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson&apos;s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> What was the cause of death? </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Was his death the result of a crime? </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> I will follow the facts wherever they lead. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> My objective is to discovery the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> &quot;I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists&quot; for a formal investigation, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2419"> A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> &quot;There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff&apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The teenager&apos;s parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban movement. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> This was reported by the embassy of that country in Great Britain, where the prime minister of Pakistan Navaz Sharif is visiting. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The head of the government of Pakistan made the announcement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of the relations of Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> &quot;The prime minister reported that dialog with the Taliban movement has begun, says the announcement of the embassy of Pakistan in London. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> - He said that he hopes and prays that the dialog starts to work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan,&quot; diplomats added. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, however they operate independently from it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Pakistani Taliban are striving to create an Islamic state. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> Previously the government of Islamabad had made attempts to begin negotiations with local Taliban, however the movement rejected the dialog. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> It declared that it would agree to negotiations only under the condition that the authorities withdraw troops deployed in regions where Taliban operate back to their permanent bases, as well as free detained islamists from prisons. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Navaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> On Tuesday, October 29, the prime minister of Great Britain David Cameron, head of the Pakistani government and Afghan president Hamid Karzai in London held a trilateral meeting where they discussed the prospects of a peace process in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The goalkeeper of &quot;Neftekhimik&quot; Matt Dalton declined to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the job as coach of Nizhnekamtsi. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The goalkeeper believes that the acting head trainer Dmitry Balmin holds a lot of authority with the players and will handle his responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Let us recall that today Neftekhimik dismissed Krikunov. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> To be honest, I would not like to comment on the firing of Vladimir Krikunov, RIA Novosti cites Dalton. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will handle the responsibilities placed upon him - I have no doubt about that. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> He holds a lot of authority on the team, a big future certainly awaits this young specialist. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch </seg>
<seg id="2444"> At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters&quot; school fees. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money&apos;s stuck there,&quot; Mrs Amirthalinga says. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga&apos;s case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> This week Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks&quot; creditworthiness. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> &quot;Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can,&quot; says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state&apos;s 200 pawn outlets are gold. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> People are saying &quot;the gold price looks good, let&apos;s pawn grandma&apos;s gold chain and get it back next month. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax&apos;s executive director. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> &quot;Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> There&apos;s an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> We see customers from all walks of life. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> &quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs,&quot; says Ms Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Sometimes they just need the money very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Bashkiria can put grain up for tender no earlier than the beginning of 2014 </seg>
<seg id="2474"> The Republic&apos;s Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Kovalenko believes that during government purchasing interventions Bashkiria can put grain up for tender no earlier than the beginning of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> As of today, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> So far the market price is higher, and there is demand. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> &quot;It is possible that grain will be put up for tender after the New Year,&quot; he announced at yesterday&apos;s press conference. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> The Minister recalled that this year sowing of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest made up 3.1 million hectares, including acreage of grain crops of 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% higher than last year. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> For the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand hectares have been sown (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012). </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Acreage for winter wheat and triticale has been increased, rye remained at the previous level. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> A football fan who broke a window in a station waiting lounge was detained in the Voronezh region </seg>
<seg id="2482"> At nine o&apos;clock in the evening on October 29 at the Gryazi-Voronezhskie station, members of the transportation police removed from a passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> After departing for a game of their favorite team, on the way the guys caused a drunken row on the train. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> The young people were delivered to the duty room of the line department of police at the Gryazi station to file an administrative offense report. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> There the fans regretted their antisocial behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> Policemen filed administrative material on them and let them go. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> The young people purchased tickets for the next train and began to wait for its arrival at the station. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> At half past twelve in the night, the fans left the building of the railway station, however one of them, a 22-year-old young man, suddenly returned and used his leg to break a window of the entrance door in the station&apos;s waiting lounge. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> An officer of the transportation police and a security guard from the private security company of &quot;Russian Railways&quot; rushed to the sound of breaking glass. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> They managed to detain the perpetrator attempting to flee the scene. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> An investigation is being conducted by officers of the Southeastern Line Authority of the Russian MVD. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The issue regarding initiation of criminal proceedings is being decided, reported senior advisor for information and public relations of the Southeastern Line Authority of the Russian MVD for transportation Sergei Olkhovik. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Russian security agencies know nothing about the group &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; - New Izvestia </seg>
<seg id="2494"> INTERFAX.RU writes about it citing an information source in RF law enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> &quot;After reports of Leps being entered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury into blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate &apos;Brotherly Circle&apos; emerged in the media, we looked through all databases, but we did not detect such a group,&quot; said the agency source. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> According to him, the distribution of such information helps maintain the myth about the so-called Russian mafia, which supposedly operates abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> As &quot;NI&quot; previously had written, yesterday the U.S. Department of the Treasury published on its website a list of supposed members of the criminal group &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Among them the Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> He appears in the list as &quot;Grisha&quot;, they put out the day before. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, stage name, place and data of birth are specified. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Besides Leps, another five persons are mentioned there. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and one more native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the U.S. they are confident that Grigory Leps, who resides on the island of Phuket, transported money for gangsters on their orders. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> To this message was attached a photograph of the singer and was specified all of his data, which correspond to the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a home on Phuket. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> In the agency they noted that they intend to impose sanctions in relation to Leps. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> A person&apos;s entry into blacklists of the American Department of the Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with him by persons living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> The assistant of Leps Maya Serikova stated that no notifications have come to the singer: &quot;It is difficult to answer the question, is Grigory the one about whom everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the U.S.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2510"> All that Leps knows is media information. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> He personally received no official notifications, although I don&apos;t know if they happen in such cases. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> &quot;And, of course, all this, on one hand, is ridiculous, but on the other - surprising and unexpected,&quot; she stated to RIA Novosti. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but, as the U.S. Department of the Treasury asserts, he indeed has a home on the Thai island. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> She stated that now Leps is on a long tour across the Far East and Siberia, and that the news reached him during a flight to the city of Blagoveschensk. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> A black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> As America&apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America&apos;s major roads. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The tea party is aghast. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And while Congress can&apos;t agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This really is a must for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;It is not a matter of something we might choose to do,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The technology is there to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The push comes as the country&apos;s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans don&apos;t buy as much gas as they used to. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Cars get many more miles to the gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn&apos;t gone up in 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;The gas tax is just not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> &quot;This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state&apos;s ambitious global warming laws. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> &quot;This is not just a tax going into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People are paying more directly into what they are getting. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country&apos;s biggest experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Nevada has already completed a pilot. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> New York City is looking into one. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> The concept is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers&apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> It was not something people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals&apos; everyday comings and goings. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don&apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can choose a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide &quot;pay-as-you-drive&quot; insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> &quot;Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them,&quot; says a city planning document. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don&apos;t use much gas, so they pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the commission&apos;s director of legislation and public affairs. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they&apos;re the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There are now 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2585"> In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February&apos;s consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Next year&apos;s consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> In the past the Pope decided everything on his own. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> But we&apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it&apos;s all completely new. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was &quot;full of surprises -- so we don&apos;t know who he&apos;ll name.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The VII Interregional &quot;Medicine and Health&quot; exhibition opened in Ivanovo. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> The interregional exhibition &quot;Medicine and Health - 2013&quot; opened at the &quot;Olympia&quot; sport and recreation complex. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The First Deputy Chairperson of the Government of the Ivanovo Region, Olga Khasbulatova took part in the festive opening of the event. </seg>

<seg id="2610"> Tax on foreign property owners to burst London&apos;s bubble </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Mr Cook said: &quot;Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2614"> &quot;But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning &quot;domestic market&quot; with the city&apos;s south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The scheduled meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region took place at the Yalutorovsk automobile factory. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> As part of the event, there was a presentation of a new line of production of electric-welded steel tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov related, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner, marketing research was conducted to study the market for selling steel structures in the Tyumen region. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> It was found that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric-welded tubes per month. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Then a decision was made to change the profile of the factory and install within it equipment for their production. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Already this year more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Investments in the factory made up more than 120 million rubles, - recounted Denis Gribanov. </seg>
<seg id="2624"> In October a new mill was launched, which helps augment the product mix. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The factory produces small tube sections that are used for greenhouse facilities, small-scale construction and the furniture industry, as well as large ones for the construction industry. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> We plan to reach a production level of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will make up around 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees at the plant has not been reduced - now it amounts to 157 people, when new equipment is purchased there are plans to increase personnel by more than 50 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> Retraining of staff is underway at the plant, and necessary specialists are being selected from those already available. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Next year it is planned to commission a new unit for slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will help reduce the cost of products, as well as another mill with a tube production speed of up to 47 meters per minute. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> By the end of 2014 at the plant they intend to master the production of tubes that are used in housing and utilities infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Plant management is aiming to cover up to 70 percent of Tyumen region&apos;s demand for these products. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing production managers, recommended putting greater emphasis on modernizing machine-building plants. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Also directed at this are forms of government support of industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans to purchase new equipment and expenses on its leasing. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> This year 150 million rubles have been allocated for these objectives, two thirds of this amount have already been spent. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> The last committee that will examine subsidy agreements are accepting documents from plants until November 15. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> In addition, expenses on the participation of local producers in international fairs are reimbursed by the budget. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles that may be used to compensate leasing payments and loans to acquire new equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> 5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Funds for reimbursing ordered and paid equipment that is produced in the south of Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex will be reduced to 72 million rubles. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> According to Leonid Ostroumov, ultimately this form of support will end since the motive of its introduction was compensation of the extraction tax that oil companies paid into the regional budget. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Presently they are not doing this and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Accordingly, the regional government considers direct support of industrial plants to be priority, and not financing of the oil industry through them. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Many plant managers expressed concern in connection with the developing situation in relations with oil companies. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> A subsidy for equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of industry in the south of Tyumen region, and if it is canceled it will be difficult to compete in price with the temperate zone of Russia where the work force is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> In addition, the issue is unclear regarding the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company &quot;Rosneft&quot;, which so far is not placing its orders at Tyumen plants. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> The agreement on implementing the Uvatskiy project expires in 2013, and requests for its extension have not been received. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> At present, plants in the south of the region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The open-ended question remains, will taxes from oil produced in the Uvatskiy region proceed to the budget of the region or will they be paid based on the place of registration of the new owner of the fields? </seg>
<seg id="2650"> The 2nd conference of peoples of the South Urals took place in Chelyabinsk. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> The forum was timed to coincide with National Unity Day, the 400th annivesary of the restoration of Russian statehood, and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> The work of the conference involved delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, bodies of legislative and executive power - altogether around 350 people. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The course of the forum was aimed at strengthening interethnic concord. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Here we can set an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> We have no discrepancies and contentions. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> We live in complete mutual understanding,&quot; asserts Theophan, metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Over the course of the meeting a number of issues were examined, including fostering patriotism, cultural cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Based on the results of the convention, they adopted a resolution. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The unofficial part of the forum was continued in the opera and ballet theater. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Here they opened the exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says </seg>
<seg id="2662"> Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country&apos;s north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country&apos;s civil war nearly three years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> 1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or &quot;render inoperable&quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus&apos; chemical weapons by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad&apos;s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> It has not updated that figure since. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Assad&apos;s troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons&apos; inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was &quot;now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria&apos;s declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2682"> It added that, &quot;no further inspection activities are currently planned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2686"> It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW&apos;s executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> &quot;I salute the fortitude and courage you&apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; the watchdog&apos;s director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad&apos;s government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> In other developments, the Observatory&apos;s chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria&apos;s coastal province of Latakia. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The cause of the blast was not known, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2693"> President Barack Obama&apos;s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann&apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2695"> The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President&apos;s top aides conducted &quot;extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011&quot; to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama&apos;s waning re-election hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> According to the Times&apos; national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Only half a dozen of the President&apos;s closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> &quot;Double Down&quot; claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal rapport,&quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn&apos;t &quot;materially improve Obama&apos;s odds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2700"> In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the paper. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, &quot;Holy Christ, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> While Daley characterized the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> &quot;Campaigns don&apos;t spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they&apos;re seriously considering something,&quot; Martin said on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> It&apos;s unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> While Daley said he doesn&apos;t think the President &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it&apos;s &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama&apos;s desk. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> &quot;Possibly,&quot; Martin replied. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the RFU Artur Grigoryants reported that &quot;Kuban&quot; has been fined for 500 thousand rubles, relays &quot;SE&quot; correspondent Phillip PAPENKOV from the Football House. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Such sanctions in relation to the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the Dagestan flag by fans in the stands during a 14th round home match against &quot;Anzhi&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> We examined all available materials. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> &quot;Kuban&quot; was fined 500 thousand rubles for unlawful behavior of spectators. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Russian brewers are in a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> According to their estimates, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the previous level, and that is the best case scenario. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Although businessmen initially expected growth. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> After all, the current year is developing unsuccessfully for them: sales dropped by 7 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> All of this was told by the head of one of the largest beer brewing companies in the country, chairman of the Council of the Russian Beer Brewing Union Isaac Sheps at the Adam Smith Institute&apos;s 3rd annual conference &quot;Day-to-day Goods in Russia&quot;, which just completed in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> At it they discussed government regulation of the market. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> From 2008 through 2012 the Russian beer market already contracted by 18 percent since in recent years in the country we are observing significant strengthening of regulation of the beer brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a beverage with small alcohol content, Sheps told listeners. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> There&apos;s no other country in the world with such rigid restriction of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of more and more new irrational bans that are supposedly founded on a battle against alcohol abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The beer brewer complained that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not exert any real influence, nonetheless more and more new initiatives are constantly emerging. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> The ban on selling alcohol in kiosks that was introduced this year hit beer producers the hardest of all. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers,&quot; said Isaac Sheps. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Beer brewers have two forecasts for the coming year. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Optimistic - the one Sheps talked about: sales of the frothy beverage will remain at the previous level. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Pessimistic - they will drop by another 2-3 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from varieties that are tailored to the mass consumer to the &quot;premium&quot; class: there will be less beer, but it will cost more. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Meanwhile, radical consequences from the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are so far not apparent. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Based on my observations, the level of alcoholism disorders remains at approximately the same level,&quot; said doctor-narcologist Aleksei Sotnikov. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Granted, there is an increased percentage of patients who consumed surrogates of hard liquors, as well as those who &quot;got hooked&quot; on alcohol-containing tonics such as &quot;Jaguar&quot;, while ten years ago specifically &quot;beer-based&quot; alcoholism was dominant. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> What will be the result of construction of transport hubs in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Each year, the capital&apos;s authorities promise to develop more and more transport hubs (TH). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> There are plans to commission 255 transport hubs before 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Our correspondent found out what the project really entails. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> A couple of months ago a construction fence arose near the Smolenskaya metro station on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> A sign announced ongoing development of a transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> All of this was very strange since no above-ground transport stops near &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; and, consequently, it is impossible to transfer to it. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sadovoe ring road, it is necessary to cover around 130 meters, including an above-ground crossing over Karmanitskiy lane. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now almost everything is finished at Smolenskaya. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> The flower kiosk disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced with stone block. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> That is the entire transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transport hubs can be planar and extensive, they explain in the press office of the capital&apos;s department of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> So far there are no extensive transport hubs. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> But planar ones involve the construction of parking areas, removal of shopping facilities that inhibit the movement of passengers, creation of small architectural forms and landscaping. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> In fact, transport specialists do not engage in planar transport hubs, but site improvement professionals from the capital repairs department of the city of Moscow do. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> A transport hub is not necessarily an elaborate construction, explains the director of the Institute of Economics for Transportation and Transportation Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Sometimes a roof overhead and a panel notifying about transport arrival time are enough. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Well, for example, they recently opened an entirely full-fledged planar transport hub at the &quot;Yasenevo&quot; metro. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Granted, without awnings, but with intercepting parking areas and panels indicating when a bus will arrive. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of quantity, officials register as transport hubs everything at hand. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> As early as 2011 the mayor&apos;s office planned to construct only 151 hubs, of which 59 with capital construction. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now as many as 255 transport hubs are listed in plans up to 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> They promise to commission a hundred and fifty of them this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Even though there is a transport hub development program in the city, no qualitative criteria are designated, states Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization &quot;City and Transport&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> They report on the number of facilities, but the quality of the transfer on each of them frequently gets worse. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> According to experts, there should be two criteria: firstly - reduction in transfer time, secondly - convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Above all, the capability to change transport mode without going out into the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In Moscow, however, with transport hub development sometimes it turns out exactly opposite. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> A striking example is the &quot;VDNKh&quot; metro. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavl highway entered the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russia Exhibition Center. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now their stops have been re-located to the opposite side of Yaroslavl highway to Cosmonaut street. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Further from the metro, significantly further from the monorail, though closer to residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Even though residents downright did not want a bus terminal under their windows and complained on all possible levels. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Extensive transport hubs in Moscow somehow immediately did not succeed. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> They began to build the first of them about five years ago at the &quot;Planernaya&quot; metro. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The project was designed to be exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And in fact it succeeded as an example of how a transport hub sold out to investors is turned into a banal shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, here there are platforms for buses, an awning so as not to walk from the metro station in the rain, and three floors of bus stops. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> Granted, they on principle did not provide space to Khimki trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> They were pushed away further from the metro as strangers. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> On the other hand, more space was left for trading. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> 32 stores of only clothes, but generally there is almost everything - from pet goods to a car dealership. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well, indeed, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the way? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Around here, when they build an extensive transport hub, for some reason a shopping center always results. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when they decided to put part of a parking area on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now, lively trade is occurring on the third floor of the &quot;Planernaya&quot; transport hub among the parking places marked out on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Vegetables, seasoning, Chinese jeans, non-Russian conversation and security guards maliciously looking at our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> The transport hub has completely turned into a bazaar. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The thing is, previously there was a market at &quot;Planernaya&quot; metro, but they tore it down. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> But in the prefect&apos;s office they took pity on vendors and let them onto the intercepting parking area of the transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Nevertheless, due to high prices it is always empty there. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The most humorous part is that the market was torn down in order to build in its place... the new planar transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> That&apos;s the shuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At the Kaluzhskaya metro, the approach distance from the metro vestibule to the bus made up 50 meters, recounts Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After construction of the shopping center, allegedly a transport hub, the distance increased to 170 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> In order to board the bus, it is necessary to walk through the entire shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> After 22:00, when it is closed, it is necessary to walk around it under the open sky. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> By the way, the constructions on Planernaya and Kaluzhskaya will soon seem like roses. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> In mid September, the urban planning and land commission of the mayor&apos;s office confirmed the planning solutions for the first eight extensive transport hubs. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Four of them will be 25-storied, not counting the two-three underground levels. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> The main monster will develop at the Tushino metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Representatives of the directorate of railway terminals of Russian Railways who are responsible for construction of the transport hub at the metro have already told journalists: stores, hotels and apartments will be available in future multi-story buildings. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> At the same time, officials assure that multi-level parking areas will occupy from a third to half of the area. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Let&apos;s take as an example &quot;public&quot; garages. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Let&apos;s say that a garage with 258 car spaces, which they recently built on International street, has an area of 8,105 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That means that parking for 2.6 thousand cars at &quot;Petrovsko-Razumovskaya&quot; will require approximately 80 thousand &quot;squares&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> This is less than a third of the giant that they intend to build there. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Allow one-two floors to go toward all kinds of platforms for buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> There remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> And that, just a minute, is almost two state department stores. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> If the railway folks will build extensive transport hubs at stations and terminals, then the metro folks will absorb the remaining areas. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> They also promised that there will be many &quot;functional facilities&quot;, including hotels, offices, and even gyms. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> By the way, recently in the property department of the city of Moscow they told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to directly contact officials to acquire a site for a transport hub. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Without any tenders. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> Because, they say, transportation issues for the city are priority. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> An ideal transport hub is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston and Spadina station in Toronto, assures Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> There, trolleybuses and trams are sent underground to the metro level and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram equals only 50 meters without an exit to the street. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> There is no unnecessary vending around. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> But Moscow officials are given to extremes. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Either we will not build anything, or we will go as far as build 25 floors with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Oil extends drop toward $96 a barrel </seg>
<seg id="2816"> The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China&apos;s power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Ample supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> That suggests China&apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a two-decade low in the previous quarter. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In Ekaterinburg a criminal murdered two sisters and burned their bodies </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In Ekaterinburg police are searching for a criminal who brutally murdered two sisters. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> Their bodies were burned after the murder. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> As reported to &quot;New Region&quot; in the press office of the headquarters of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Sverdlov region, on the previous day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya street, the bodies of two women displaying signs of a violent death were discovered. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Soon the identities of the deceased were established. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> It emerged that they were sisters, one of them a resident of Ekaterinburg, 44 years of age, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> They had rented the burnt-out apartment several days ago. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> The chief of police of the region Mikhail Borodin took personal control of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Law enforcement agencies are working various versions of the murder, are checking alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons disposed to such actions. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In addition, they are establishing for what purpose the women rented the apartment, and where they resided previously, what did they do, with whom they maintained relations. </seg>

<seg id="2843"> The trainer of &quot;Avantgarde&quot; Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the regular KHL championship match against &quot;Salavat&quot;, noted that Omsk members conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat against Magnitogorsk &quot;Metallurg&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The expert emphasized that &quot;Avantgarde&quot; needs to put more focus on the defensive game. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> We watched video of the match against Magnitogorsk &quot;Metallurg&quot;, the official site of &quot;Avantgarde&quot; quotes Chebaturkin. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> - We missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant time. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> We missed due to our mistakes, due to non-execution of the game plan. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> We knew that the competitor has performers. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> According to statistics they had five attacks straight-off - they drove in three pucks on us. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> Very good implementation. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Those mistakes were taken into account when preparing for today&apos;s game? </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Me and the guys thoroughly analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for the next competitor. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> Above all - so that the plan is executed. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> Everyone saw the first period of the match against &quot;Metallurg&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The game plan was being executed, and the score was 2:0. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> They missed the goal &quot;into the locker room&quot; - and in the third period began to make mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Considering how difficult the game took shape, I did not see any sense in activating defenders. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The entire team needs to defend itself. </seg>
<seg id="2859"> Now &quot;Avantgarde&quot; has a long home series, matches take place every other day - has the team accumulated fatigue? </seg>
<seg id="2860"> All teams are under identical conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The main thing now is actualizing your moments and executing the game plan. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Hockey is an emotional game, if you execute the plan - everything is solved not so difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall </seg>
<seg id="2864"> Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> After the test plane&apos;s inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to &quot;sector perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> &quot;While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation,&quot; Doerksen said in a client note. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company&apos;s claims about the new jetliner&apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> &quot;The test plane didn&apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated,&quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane&apos;s downtime. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that&apos;s what we have done. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> That will happen all through the flight program. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> &quot;This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier&apos;s internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15,&quot; said Doerksen. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&apos;s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The world&apos;s fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> &quot;In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment,&quot; Beaudoin said. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The transportation division&apos;s margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Brazil&apos;s Embraer SA, the world&apos;s third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier&apos;s closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday. </seg>

<seg id="2937"> Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot;never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation,&quot; the Commission was told. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> He conceded the YMCA&apos;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot;there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management &quot;from myself down&quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> He was jailed for a minimum of six years. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord&apos;s breaches of child safety. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children&apos;s services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord &quot;very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2950"> The CEO said he did not accept staff&apos;s evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; was &quot;not about reporting&quot; by staff, and the board agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children&apos;s services Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> The hearing adjourned until December 20. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Guillaume Nicloux&apos;s adaptation of Denis Diderot&apos;s novel boasts exceptional production design and period detail but is also heavier going than it should be. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Unfolding in 1760s France, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a wantonly sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> The film never slips into prurience or sensationalism - and that&apos;s the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> The earnest solemnity of the storytelling risks making it a hair shirt-like ordeal for audiences, too. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> U.S. intelligence agencies wiretap the personal telephone of the Pope of Rome </seg>
<seg id="2964"> The activity of the Vatican is under the vigilant surveillance of American intelligence agencies. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> New documents from the collection of Edward Snowden show evidence that U.S. intelligence conducted wiretapping of all conversations of the former Pope Benedict, and now closely watches Pope Francis. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> His telephone began to be wiretapped even before he became the head of the Vatican. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> The process of electing the new Pope was also under surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> To which they assigned special emphasis in the U.S. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> An intelligence agency tapped into the cell phones of cardinals who gathered in Rome to select the next Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> Telephones of the residence where participants of the conclave lived were also wiretapped. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> American spies wiretapped all main contenders for the papacy in order to prevent a figure undesirable to Washington from emerging on it. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> The journal &quot;Panorama&quot; writes that the &quot;big ear of the U.S.&quot; continued to intercept conversations of prelates until the very completion of the conclave on March 12. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> It is asserted that in 2005 Argentine archbishop Bergolio was singled out as the future Pope of Rome. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> American intelligence also tracked negotiations associated with the elections of the new president of Vatican Bank. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> An Italian journal writes that in the U.S. embassy in Rome a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work, obtaining information on politicians and financial streams. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> In its turn, the Vatican conciliatively announced that American &quot;wiretapping&quot; does not worry it even if it does occur. </seg>

<seg id="2978"> Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker </seg>
<seg id="2979"> One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Fay&apos;s innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they&apos;re too big to play a club,&quot; Hirsch said. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> This year&apos;s event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> Several of the comedians participating in this year&apos;s festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX&apos;s gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed &quot;The League&quot;) and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; though she is best known for her viral video series &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2989"> Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> One of the festival&apos;s biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry&apos;s work,&quot; Steinberg said. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> He was telling me that, when he&apos;s here, sometimes he&apos;ll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I&apos;ll live here. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> Police detained a shooter in the Los Angeles airport </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Police detained a shooting suspect in the Los Angeles airport. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Previously it became known that in one of the airport terminals shots were fired from a rifle. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Police and rescue services evacuated people from the building. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> The perpetrator was wounded in a shootout with police, there is no information about his identity. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> Police are searching for his possible accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> Presumably, several people were injured during the shootout. </seg>
<seg id="3003"> It is noted that Barack Obama has been informed of the incident. </seg>
