<seg id="100"> The victor receives 250,000 dollars to the continuation of its extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="101"> For 21 years saw be lost Georges Bwelle with on, how sick father again and again the consciousness and traveled to hospitals, that did not control the means in order to help it. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Jamef Bwelle became 1981 in a car accident in the vicinity of Yaoundé, that injures capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="103"> First it had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation, that expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma, that should impair it for the remainder of its life, formed. </seg>
<seg id="104"> &quot;It gave no Neurochirurgen in Cameroon&quot;, so Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="105"> We would have brought out it from Cameroon if we had had the money. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Instead spent Bwelle years therewith, its father in overfilled to accompany clinics and hospitals, in order to get there the treatment, that they had to offer. </seg>
<seg id="107"> &quot;It is not simple&quot;, comments on Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="108"> One can leave at five o&apos;clock mornings the house and race is to the hospital in order to be the first, and yet not first. </seg>
<seg id="109"> There are very many patients. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Some people die even because they must wait. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The situation did hardly change since Bwelles father 2002 died. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In Cameroon, there is only a physician for 5,000 people apiece, so the world health organization. </seg>
<seg id="113"> On the other hand the ratio in the United States is about a physician for 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Yet even if there would be a physician for it, most Kameruner could not afford the visit. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Two of five people in the country live beneath the poverty line and almost three quarters the medical expenses in the country are private. </seg>
<seg id="116"> &quot;The single problem, that it have, is poverty&quot;, says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And poverty makes it impossibly to enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="118"> To see suffer its father and so many of its compatriots let ripen in Bwelle the decision to undertake somewhat on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and be carried out volunteer team in the last year 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="120"> It became even physician and works as a container surgeon in the Central hospital in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Moreover it established a public-spirited organization by the name of ASCOVIME that travels at weekends into rural areas and offers there free medical provision. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="123"> He would force himself nearly every Friday and up to 30 people in small penance and go tied up with that medical equipment on the roof over unfortified grounds into the villages, that require aid. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Always all does not pass smooth. </seg>
<seg id="125"> They had to push already more than once the vehicles through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Yet if they arrive, they will receive like heros: a banquet, song and dance and the best lodging that the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In these villages, free medical provision is is actual a reason for the celebrations and Bwelle – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – gladly in the cheerful celebration there. </seg>
<seg id="128"> At the next morning, the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="129"> &quot;Per trip treat we 500 people&quot;, so Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="130"> They come out of a vicinity of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Each of this Wochenendkliniken offers medical provision in a row of areas. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transferable illnesses. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Others receive crutch, contributed glasses or free birth documents – a document that is required for the school, however many poor families simply do not afford can. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Evenings the team carries out operations simple with local anesthetic. </seg>
<seg id="135"> The operations take place normally in a school, the city hall or a dwelling; after the intervention, the patients rise and go into the recovery area to make around place for the neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed of the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work into the early morning hours on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It is a strenuous stint, but the village musicians help normally to hold the team motivated. </seg>
<seg id="138"> &quot;You drum the entire night, so that we awake remain and our work continue can&quot;, says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday the team will go then back into the city, tiredly, but proud of the performed work. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group – a mixture out of kamerunischen physicians and foreign medicine student – carried out free operations in the last year 700 and knows that she causes an enormous difference with its work for the people, whom she helps. </seg>
<seg id="141"> A man explained that the free operation of a strip breach that he had received would enable it now to work again. </seg>
<seg id="142"> &quot;That changes the future of my family&quot;, meant the man. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Next to the Wochenendkliniken and its work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works also at night in private clinics in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="144"> With this second job, it finances 60% of its public-spirited activity, so Bwelle; the remainder comes from private contributions. </seg>
<seg id="145"> &quot;I knows really not, when it sleeps&quot;, says Katie O&apos; Malley that studies in the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelles group. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is always either in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that it can go on this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medicine students and nursing students such as O&apos; Malley, that come out of the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, is this a chance to gather practical experiences, that never would get it at home. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;We can in operations at the same time be, where we help, blood to dab away or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold&quot;, explains O&apos; Malley. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That never would be in America possible as a medicine student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students pay its trip to Cameroon normally even and bring frequently contributed Sanitätsmaterial with. </seg>
<seg id="151"> If they are however first once in Yaoundé, Bwelle receives the lodging, the carrier and the instructions. </seg>
<seg id="152"> &quot;It is entire without doubt a hero&quot;, says O&apos; Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> It dedicates its life of this organization and its wish to help the kamerunischen people, knows no boundaries. </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle, the nearly permanent work is no load. </seg>
<seg id="155"> To help other to a happier life and to fulfill therewith a promise, that it gave its father, large joy prepares it. </seg>
<seg id="156"> &quot;I am so happy, if I this work would make&quot;, means Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope, it sees, what I do. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I make it in order to bring people again for laughing and in order to mitigate the pains. </seg>

<seg id="166"> In an explanation, in which the message was announced, father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican said would take place, it a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony would be held off to the appointment of the new cardinals, that would be well known also as a Konsistorium. </seg>

<seg id="168"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote probably would have sunk until February. </seg>
<seg id="169"> He explained, a pope appoints normally so many cardinals such as compel so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote again 120 would amount to, and so many cardinals would like over 80, how he. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Let the Konsistorium in the next year be therefore significant because it would be the first since the choice of Franziskus in March these years, so Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Presently there are one certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> &quot;It becomes interesting be to see, whether the new pope of cardinals out of the remainder of the world appoint becomes, around the balance to restore&quot;, said he. </seg>

<seg id="177"> It explained, let it be &quot;well possible&quot; that Franziskus the cardinals around advice please. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Yet previously we were not in this situation – that is all entirely new. </seg>

<seg id="186"> Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring and to define the economy at a table, what that would like to change, that provide in Great Britain for prosperity and work, at our relations to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="187"> To this purpose, we gave the largest and most comprehensive survey under British business leaders in order and asked it, what it over Great Britain, that think economy and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="188"> YouGov questioned over 1,000 managements out of the economy, that portray into about the British business sizes, -sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The results of the survey will surprise many. </seg>
<seg id="190"> We found out that the predominant majority of the businesses exports outside of Europe in the meantime and concentrates on countries, that modernize and grow, while the countries stagnate in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="191"> They wish for that by government side new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of staying with the long and strenuous process, to reform the obscure EU institutions. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Ask about its view to certain legally regulated subjects – of the cartel right to the product legislation – is the majority the business leaders the view that become should gotten back control of these key competences after Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="193"> General discontent ruled over the domestic market because according to statements of the businesses the costs of that would predominate Brussels directions in the meantime the advantages to be part of Europe trade zone – even 40 percent of the large firms agreed that to, that are traditional at the Europe friendliest. </seg>
<seg id="194"> In the end, and that says probably most, yielded our inquiry of business leaders that a clear majority wishes for of Great Britain a course toward variation of the agreement and a relation to the EU that is based on trade, not on politics. </seg>
<seg id="195"> This insight, that is found in business of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy presses on a &quot;meaningful variation&quot;, that brings the notebook of the actions again to Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="196"> It concerns much – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead in 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The prime minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy stands behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="198"> It shows also that the businesses of a renegotiation expect a clear postponement of the power ratios back to Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the British economy is possible and in increasing mass necessary after the Eurozone moves now toward a narrower economy and Fiskalunion. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Jobs and growth in Great Britain must be the priority how the result of our survey shows, what means for business a reinforced attention on trade and a fundamental variation in that Brussels extension for directions. </seg>

<seg id="886"> We are the view that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program yelled at before for the airplane. </seg>
<seg id="887"> If to be sure in the coming months no new orders are announced, let&apos;s expect that the market becomes vis-à-vis the program more sceptically. </seg>

<seg id="977"> Under the direction of Hermann tailor the choir is accompanied of the Bläsergruppe of the music society cheerfulness Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Scientists were able to throw more light on that, in which context stands that tail fronds of a dog with its mood. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Earlier researches had shown that happy dogs with the tail was more to the right wedelten (from the viewpoint of the dog), while it with nervous dogs the left side. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Yet now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and can react on that. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the university Trient, said: &quot;in humans is well well known, that the left and right side of the brain differently on stimuli react, the positive or negative emotion evoke&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here we tried to look at this in other species. </seg>
<seg id="983"> It noted moreover that with dogs exactly like in humans the right side of the brain for the movement of the left side responsibly would be and reversed, and that both hemispheres different rolls played in the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> In order to learn more about that how dogs react to the tail fronds lateral of its members of the same species, supervised the researchers the animals while these films of other dogs looked at. </seg>
<seg id="985"> They measured the heart frequency of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Probably we will understand soon why the tail moves once in the one, once into the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we have the dogs films with dogs shown – either a nature loyal version or a silhouette, around distracting other aspects to eliminate, and we could therewith the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right drive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="988"> If the animals saw, like an otherwise inexpressive dog the tail to the right moved has (of the perspective of the wedelnden dog out of seen), remained relaxes it totally. </seg>
<seg id="989"> The tail inclination was however especially to the left (again out of perspective of the dog, the wedelt), its heart frequency and it got out saw restlessly. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the opinion of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally together through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> It is not convinced rather that the dogs would have learned from experience, in which movements they should worry, and when. </seg>
<seg id="992"> It said: &quot;if one different encounters with other dogs has and that fronds with the tail into a direction sooner with friendly behavior connects is and the right side sooner a less friendly behavior produces, reacts one to basis of these experiences&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the insights could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of its animal. </seg>
<seg id="994"> John Bradshaw, expert for dog behavior and guest scholar at the faculty for veterinary medicine of the university of Bristol explained, this had not been the first study, with which examined became, whether to the left and to the right for dogs would be important. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year found out a team of the university of Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and concerns to the right, if it a satisfied dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In another research project at the university of Victoria in Canada following did not stand: &quot;dogs go sooner on a robot dog to, if be, tail&apos; to the left of wedelt and to the right to become instead of restless – exactly the other way around as in the Italian study&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to its statements, the differences could stir therefore that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study how dogs react to real dogs, could help, explained it. </seg>
<seg id="999"> &quot;To be sure gives it considerable records for many different mammals, that both sides of the brain for different purposes uses become, but must many of the details yet determines become – and dogs form there no exception&quot;, so Bradshaw. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Because its behavior however simply could be recorded, it would last probably not long until we understand, why the tail moves sometimes in the one, sometimes into the other direction. </seg>

<seg id="1247"> Yes, the local councils concluded. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> Schiltach must take for that 220,000 Euro into the hand. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The Germans train the Kinzigtal track wants to improve in the coming year. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Especially the security is supposed to be increased at the same time at train transitions - regularly comes it nationwide to collision of trains with other vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> If the communities agree the reconstruction measures, they must be involved with one-third in the costs, divide the remainder itself train and alliance. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber clarified the local council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs &quot;at the deer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There the city plans to construct an Ausbuchtung in height of the tunnel mouth there west of the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> There also larger vehicles, for example such that transport long wood could stand, in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Grießhaber proposed therefore to construct a required support wall so that the city could the subsequent street to given time distributors in order to guarantee a smooth traffic river. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This controversially was discussed in the local council, pulled there some Räte the necessity of a street distribution in doubt: Thomas slag heap brought the mood of the critics with its remark on the point: Must we &quot;take&quot; so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand? </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The train transition &quot;deer&quot; would be used regularly for long wood carriers. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even wood out of the area &quot;cow stream&quot; would be transported partially over this stretch because that could not use the stretch until vehicles long to 20 meters at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main street. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In addition the stretch serves as an Umleitungfür those vehicles that may not use the tunnel, if the main street is blocked, Haas argued. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> To see there be that Kirchberg- and lock mountain tunnel rebuilt and rehabilitates become must how this is presently in Wolfach the case, could approach the train transition &quot;at the&quot; deer&quot; also for a longer period an important traffic meaning. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The Räte agreements let examine, which would cause costs the angedachte widening of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Without regard to its was agreed by a majority with the standard that the required support wall is constructed so, with the reconstruction of the train transition that the city could expand the subsequent street direction &quot;railway station street&quot; if necessary for encounter traffic on approximately 5.5 meter. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The reconstruction of the train transition in the tannery Trautwein could stretch on the other hand an entirely other problem after, concerns that the driveway into the strongly increasing &quot;Geroltzhäuser way&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The administration had examine let the reconstruction plans of the train of the engineer office Breinlinger because it had doubt on that, whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser of way would be further possible then yet without. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation concluded that not to exclude would be, that the inclination ratios of the street could lead in addition, that longer vehicles rest. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The responsibility for this carries again the city as a road construction load carrier. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The reconstruction could stretch accordingly liability disputes after. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Because both the wood removal and the turning in the current extension condition functioned, one should not agree with the reconstruction of the train transition, argued Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Also let the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition be here clearly slighter than at the other train transitions because directly beside it the stop point middle would be, to which a good line of sight would exist. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Even trains of the central station here should have been braked here already so far that no collision would threaten. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> By a majority the approval was denied the reconstruction of this train transition because the city Schiltach could withdraw the problem with resting vehicles &quot;bathe from must&quot;, so the Räte, because the train after conclusion of the structural work out of the responsibility. </seg>

<seg id="1427"> Coulson used telephone Hacking for the reviewing of a tip </seg>
<seg id="1428"> The earlier News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson used nominally &quot;telephone Hacking, supervision and confrontation&quot; in the attempt to confirm an incorrect tip over an affair of the at that time Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> District attorney Andrew Edis QC declared the court in the Old Bailey, News of the world an incorrect rumor had heard in May 2005 indicating that Clarke would have a ratio with its &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> The newspaper delegated the private detective Glenn Mulcaire therewith to hoe Pawlbys Voicemails, and pursued it, but Coulson it called also and left behind messages how the court learned. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> &quot;According to concept of the district attorney&apos;s office is Coulson, that now publisher of the NotW is, no one, that before the dwelling of people stands and hopes, it in the act to catch, but rather one, that people gladly with a story confronts, around its reaction to see&quot;, explained Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> It said, NotW would use three procedures in order to research stories investigatively: Telephone Hacking, supervision and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The publisher is involved personally in the third method. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Obviously it does not know can be of the second, the supervision, differently it. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> How does it look with the first? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Does it know over the telephone Hacking? </seg>
<seg id="1437"> It contests that, but we say: &quot;and whether it therefrom knew&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Rumors over an affair Clarkes were not taken up first of the Feature editorship of NotW when, said became to a source that was interested sexually at Pawlby: &quot;wasting you your time, it is with Charles together&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A volume with Voicemails of its telephone of at least three occasions was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires dwelling. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> The investigators found moreover entries on the computer of the detective, on which Pawlby and its sister were stored as a &quot;projects&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> At the time, when the investigations ran, the grandparents received of Pawlby anonymous calls, in which they were asked about information about it, Edis explained. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Meanwhile the former boss reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the earlier reporter James inspected Weatherup the supervision of the movements of Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On the 18th of June 2005, Coulson left behind a Voicemail with following contents: &quot;I have a story, that we tomorrow bring out want, over that I gladly with Charles speak would like&quot; to it. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> Edis explained, followed Coulsons activities in this story the same pattern such as at other important personalities, about the earlier Secretary of the Interior David Blunkett. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> The sworn heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted because of an affair with a married woman, when he himself was allied with the codefendants Rebekah Brooks, who had been at that time married. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: Faster adult become </seg>
<seg id="1449"> Afroamerikanische and hispanische girl tend to reach sooner puberty than its white age comrades how investigations show. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical variations do not mean yet directly puberty </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is no record that hormone or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe, the epidemic obesity would be a trigger of the early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend to the early puberty is stamped fewer with boy </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The earlier CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialized in child health and family subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Should a mother be provided if its daughter already in the age of seven or of eight years breasts and shame hairs grow? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> In the annual conference of the pediatrician association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, explained the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical variations would be relatively normally under American girls and represented a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> &quot;I spend much time therewith, parents to calm – normally is that no sign, that now quickly puberty enters&quot;, clarified Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Obvious notices of the development how for example growing breasts, shamed hairs and shoulder hairs as well as body smell, appear with girl earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> Nevertheless there was only an easy postponement in the age of the Menarche (appearance of the first rule hemorrhage) in the last 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States, the average age is about 12.5 years, something less than 12.75 in the year 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;If the development of the breasts begins, takes it longer at least two to three years to the Menarche&quot;, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book &quot;early puberty with girl: The essential counselor to the contact with this frequently appearing problem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Time is the most exact test how puberty yelled at before. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is disputed, what represents actually the start of puberty, but it counts &quot;precocious&quot; if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age by eight years. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something, that a pediatrician exactly supervise can. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In faster ahead step, tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems such as Tumore or cysts can be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense another consequence: the premature aging of the bones that can lead as an ultimatum to growth inhibition and therewith small body growth with adult. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a medicinal or hormonelle therapy orient themselves towards the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz is reservedly, what concerns medicines, but it clears: &quot;the suppressing of puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girl soften, unlike its age comrade to be&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other large problem is intelligible: Parents would not want simply that its very young daughters have the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;You provide yourself because of the pregnancy risk or about, like it the hygienic side handle&quot;, said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;It was a shock&quot;, remembers a woman whose daughter with ten got its days. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Also if there were first signs and had spoken we over menstruation, emotionally was not prepared it. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> It came frightens and excited of the school home because it was that not until its circle of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many comprehensively published theories over the causes of premature puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> No conclusive proofs exist yet for that that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causal. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Boy come similar to girl earlier into puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz is convincing would be the view, that premise the epidemic of the obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> It supported the execution of a study in 2001 over girl in the age of six to nine years, who produces a context between body fat and the entrance into puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country, afroamerikanische and hispanische girl reach tendency sooner puberty than its white age comrades. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are for that different explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Globally an early puberty of all possible things seems influenced to be, of economy conditions over the climate to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A further riddle: Although boy the face hair and shame hair already earlier are awake, the trend to a complete earlier puberty is not stamped so like with girl. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other physicians on the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The emerging of Akne and pubic hair is spread even in baby and infants. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> &quot;We must be careful, like we the true start of puberty identify&quot;, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children&apos;s it hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Parents should not hesitate to be advised of its pediatrician how they should speak with its child. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;That can mean, that one earlier than an expected a conversation lead must&quot;, advised Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If one remains quiet, the child reacts normally good. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Girl, who early erblühen, need the insurance, that is the process a normal part of life, even if it enters thought earlier than. </seg>

<seg id="1527"> To hear were the guest fans with its songs predominantly. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The south platform on the other hand where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself first of all extraordinarily quietly: No songs, no battle calls. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> The podium of the Capo that otherwise the joint Anfeuerung coordinates remained unoccupied. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> And in front on the platform, a large flag with inscription &quot;section stadium ban&quot; blew solitarily. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Only as goalkeeper novel meadow fur such as always as the first BVB player the place entered, surged short-term jubilation up. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> When its team colleagues followed, there were loud song and blowing scarves - however by far everywhere. </seg>

<seg id="1536"> As last was like always the south platform at the row - and finally here again how was lived the loudest place in the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> And at the latest as with whistled at of the south platform the loud request &quot;Derbysieger stands on&quot; came, was again all like always. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The being quiet before was well a reaction to the events of the past days. </seg>

<seg id="1550"> What does with my e-mail happen underway? </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Actually electronic letter is named e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Did e-mail become in the design of the Internet service similar to at the conventional postal service technically the letter secret transferred? </seg>
<seg id="1553"> In the philosophy of the early Internet services stood to make in the foreground, communication possible. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Therefore one did not respect in the basic technical protocols on that to create a stable foundation for an anhörsicheren correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Therefore a conventional e-mail corresponds sooner an open postcard than a sealed letter. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> Does if user &quot;Anna&quot; send at &quot;Benni&quot; a mail, the computers of both then directly are connected? </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The e-mail-program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step at the mail server of its service provider. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> If it banks for example GMail, the Google would be. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> This mail server sends the contents at the provider, that Benni uses. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> On the stretch, the mail can run over some other servers on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Bennie can call the contents then in its provider. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Read conventional e-mails along on its way through the network? </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Most mails are read underway repeatedly of software robots. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> In the provider of the sender is reviewed as a rule whether the mail leads a damage program as a supplement with itself. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> On the receivers systems, a virus Check is undertaken also. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Moreover the providers review whether it concerns a troublesome and undesirable spam mail, that is deleted immediately or becomes way sorted at least into a spam file. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Do the robots have another further task? </seg>
<seg id="1568"> In systems such as GMail, the robot determines also the information that Google for placing of context advertising requires. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> If Anna and Benni communicate per GMail over its coming vacation trips, Google can fade in corresponding links to vacation offer. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Do also unknown people read along the e-mail? </seg>
<seg id="1571"> The probability that trespassers people read along a mail, is extremely slight. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> That is theoretical however possible. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> In firms, administrators have frequently the possibility read along electronic postal service. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> Also the punishment pursuit authorities and secret services have legal possibilities to intercept e-mails or to notice. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> In addition possible illegal Ausspäh actions come. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Is it possible to protect e-mails against the read along? </seg>
<seg id="1577"> With an encoding after the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encoded effectively against read along. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> With high technical expense, it is also possible, to disguise the Meta data of an e-mail-communication so that once without further recognized will not can, who has communicates with whom. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail-market in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> In the mainly privately related post-office boxes, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinated role according to an investigation of Convios Consulting out of the August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen finally, GMail of Google was able to gain clearly. </seg>

<seg id="1583"> Background is a possible minister deficiency: The Protestant lutherische country church Hanover calculates therewith that the number its approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors will halve themselves to present situation presently until 2030. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> For young people of today, let the occupation be very attractive and would offer good future outlooks, said pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the conversation with the Protestant press service. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> It is attractive to be able to determine the works and routine itself. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> With Burfien, the country church delegated for the first time a pastor on a full place to enthuse young people for the theology study. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Currently always less young people decide after the graduation examination, to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Burfien attributes this to the process of the Entkirchlichung: &quot;God voice is is quiet, the world loud&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> At the same time the occupation of large freedom and variety would be stamped. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> I am gentleman of my appointment calendar and can set there my focal points where it is important to me. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Pastors could be as a Seelsorger entirely near at the people. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> They earned so much like teacher and could live well therefrom. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Certainly would be paid would have more in the free economy, but for that theologians a certain employer. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> That comes the young people of today toward, whom it would concern not only career, but rather around a sense fulfilled work. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> According to the country church, that comprises three-quarters of Lower Saxony, approximately 60 pastors go presently per year into the retirement. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Simultaneously about 40 graduates of a theology study begin its Vikariat. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In thinly populated outskirtss such as the resin, the Emsland or the turning point country could become future it heavy to occupy places. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Burfien wants to arrange among other things study day for young people and wants to invite in addition also prominent, the theology studied have. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> The theology study offers a wide education. </seg>

<seg id="1607"> Proofs before the commission show rather that the YMCA was instructed about that, that it received the second lowest estimation of four possible in a quality audit of the department of Education and Communities (upbringing ministry) in August the year. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare, that began with 21 in the YMCA, cleared would have fails and not guaranteed, the management &quot;of me at downward&quot; in the attitude of lord that colleagues had been himself over its obligations in the clear to report offences against the guidelines to the child security. </seg>

<seg id="1628"> Meeting place for its leaderships is the service center of Cologne tourism direct at the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The tour begins very unspectacularly: &quot;We catch in the underground garage at&quot;, says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car just city, and therefore only that remained stand of the remainders of the old city wall, what was not too large. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most users of the park house hurry therefore today also at the Roman remnants past and turn down only its car. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Yet who more exactly views there, discovers a finding place detached archeological by metal bars in the park cover D2. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> To see are about five meters ruins high out of handtellergroßen stones. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;It are remainders of the Roman city wall, that in the second half of the first century after Christ built became&quot;, tells Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before it goes again back at the daylight, Schulze lets throw the participants on the upper park plain another view in a dark, depth of 15 meter of shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> That is the well of the old cathedral that unfortunately also is hardly perceived. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Next station of the tour is climb the Prätorium, and here again down the participants into the depth. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Prätors of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> A visitor would like to know what means CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;The abbreviation stands for&quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot;, what on well Germans so much like &quot;city of Roman to the right and city of the Agrippinenser, established means under emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult&quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> And in the Prätorium, it concerns the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman empire at the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> A tunnel access to the Roman sewer, that leads received is here on approximately 120 meters length by the lobby of the display. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> &quot;You can quietly a piece along the so-called Cloaca maxima go along, if you want&quot;, muntert Schulze the guests up. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> A surprise still has Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> After it got the key at the cash register, it leads the group to a depth of 16 meter, accessible shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> &quot;We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath&quot;, explains it. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Jewish community constructed its bath deeply into the ground in order to come at the ground water, that was inevitable for the ritual washings. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Until today are in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins into the eighth century return, different water levels through changing levels of the Rhine readably. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The Mikwe becomes part of an archeological zone on the city hall place, for which the structural work should begin briefly. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> To the completion will pass however a few more years. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> Country Rover series of Rally announced </seg>
<seg id="1652"> In the interior, race seat and six-point-belts as well as a free intercom are found. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The option of rich of reinforced brakes, a service package with care of Bowler-cause-mechanics and logistical support up to vehicle deposit between organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Drew Bowler, manager of Bowler motoring, explains: &quot;the Rally customers, that to Bowler come, have itself changes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> They are not all learned racers, but rather people, that in search of tension and adventure are as well as after an attainable way to world class organizations. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We are happy to can and to believe open this way in partnership with country Rover and the MSA that the format opens possibilities new to experience the different Rally disciplines in Great Britain and foreign countries and to prepare novice for the strain and the reality of Rally Raid. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> We had really joke on that to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – that becomes an entertaining championship. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> In addition there is a training day and test day in the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Near East. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> George Kerevan: European divestiture gives the scot the choice </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new fright story to the independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required in order to join the Schengen room as a condition for the EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That delivers the cue for stories over passport inspection in Berwick and one with barbed wire secured boundary along the Hadrianswalls. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> In the deed was referred in the Strathclyde model to the possible economic advantages, played, that would bring more trip freedom in the remaining Europe with itself, but this – as expected – in the headlines no role. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Also no one mentioned that the EU member countries bend right themselves frequently its strict rules, if it more favorably is for it. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Because Scotland does not belong presently to the Schengen room, the continued non-observance would be for Brussels only a small concession in return for that, what one wants really of the scot. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Therefore actually no story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And a, that came already so in the years, that it is similar to already a fossil: I heard the first time the &quot;independence meant passport inspection&quot; -duck before at least 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> At the same time an interesting point gets lost in the permanent repeating of this age old story. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances after the European pipe? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why do the Londoner yoke against that of Brussels exchange, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Those are the actual European novelties: The large after which war run is plan calm to the union of Europe into the coring. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the Euro crisis, the project Europe officially died. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Everywhere in the EU, parties win at ground, that EU hostily are or would like to throw the Euro as a common currency over board. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany, the Euro sceptical party was able to manage to grab alternative for Germany – first this year established – tightly five million voices in the Bundestag election in September for itself and was able to banish therewith effectively the free democrats (that equivalently to the British liberally Democrats) out of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There was already always domestic resistance against the plan, to create a federalist Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The current economic crisis turns out to be sure as a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the cost-cutting policy imposed severe by Berlin and the European central bank in connection with the compulsion jacket, in which the respective national economy is compelled by the adherence to the joint currency, are many people of the view, the project Europe would be to far gone. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The crisis of the Euro has to do few therewith that national governments cause excessive budgets deficits – that was only in Greece the case. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead the Euro system nailed its members on exchange rates, advantageously are that for German exporters – and that would like to let German politicians gladly so. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe with an incorporated productivity disadvantage regains itself vis-à-vis Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The single possibility exists therein to shorten wages and public editions – encouraged of Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Behind the current budget problems and currency problems, a deep going European productivity problem lies. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a consequence of the energy guidelines decreed &quot;green&quot; by Brussels – a code for the subsidizing More french and German energy businesses at the expense of consumer –, the European industry pays compared the double for electricity and the fourfold to the United States for gas. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> That is some paralyzing costs disadvantage how we were able to see already in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All wage festival spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry before that to be pressed of cheap American slate gas into the corner. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> As a consequence, a revolt pulls up, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle, with which one hold Germany in chess and Paris was able to lift at eye level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Yet Berlin needs Paris no longer as a gate to the political authorization and pressed Europe its own economic policy wherewith the marred French economy has to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Navy Le Pens of to the right arranged, EU hostile front nationally won just a decisive after choice and referred therewith the reigning socialists to place three. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The front the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes nationally is now – a timely warning for the British Labour party that it cannot assume, a split in the right spectrum would mean automatically advantages for the left. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What does Le Pen make with its newly won popularity under the white Frenchman of the worker class? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It would like to use the EU choices next year in addition, an Anti EU-to forge Anti common currency block in the European parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If the Anti-EU-parties in these choices well cut off – and that is very well possible –, could dominate for the first time such a block the European parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point on which I want out: In not all too furthermore future, the growing resentment against the EU and the joint currency will meet itself to the abolition of the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but it will become sooner something akin to the &quot;Europe of the (sovereign) nations&quot;, that general favored de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Germany and a couple of its satellite economies hold perhaps at the Euro firmly, but France and southern Europe will return to its own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Great Britain of this project dissociates itself in the hope to ingratiate myself in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> To be sure interest growing in the Pacific room suggests Washington that Great Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where does Scotland remain in all that? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can decide to be a region of (in last consequence) small England. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economic interests – why also belonged to say Berlin and Brussels, what they can stick there itself where. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I assume, Scotland could go in a looser European association very well as far as we retain our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is simpler in a not federate Europe of the nations. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise we should consider, should retain it Norway gleichzutun and our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkable would prove – the most successful political movement against the cost-cutting policy in Europe and won 2011 a spectacular majority based on the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) abridgments, that the Labour treasury Ministers had to take responsibility for Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib the coalition. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> It would be for Scotland laughable to decide now on an independence, to got forced only around then of Berlin and Brussels a cost-cutting policy. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (however no mobile phone conversations lead) </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Flight travelers can hear now its electronic devices from the take-off to the landing for reading, works, games, music and can use the appearance of films, telephone not however with the mobile phone, so the new guidelines that were published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation administration (FAA) in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Yet the passengers should not expect that these changes are transferred immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How quickly they would implement, would depend on the respective airline, explained FAA colleague Michael Huerta on a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training handbooks of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowing of the devices corresponding to the new directions. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA explained, it had received already of some airlines plans, that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Under these airlines, also delta and JetBlue were. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> &quot;According to condition of the plan could we the expanded utilization of electronic devices very soon approve&quot;, announced the FAA in an announcement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Presently passengers must disengage Smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> They may start it first then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> In the entrance in the country approach, the passengers must disengage it again and may start it not again before the airplane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> After the new guidelines, airlines, whose airplanes against electronic interferences would be certain, could to use its passengers permit, the devices also in start, landing and on the roll field, explained the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Most new traffic airplanes and other flyers, who were converted for the use by Wi Fi in larger heights, should correspond to the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, president of the occupation association of professional flight companion, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> &quot;If the new regulation certainly transferred is – and we work relating to this closely with the airline together –, become both side therefrom profit&quot;, commented on Glading. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> We honestly are said it sorrow to have to feel at this subject such as overseer. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Nevertheless Internet connections for surfing, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or downloading of data remained forbidden under three kilometers further, clarified the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Passengers are requested, Smartphones to transfer Tablets and other devices in the flight mode. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Therefore still no &quot;Word With Friends&quot;, that Scrabble resembling Online game, that the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 played on its Smartphone, when he had to leave public effective a jet of American airlines, because he refused to disengage the device while the airplane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> And heavier devices such as laptops must be stowed also further because here an injury danger exists, if they fly by the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Mobile phone conversations during the flight remain forbidden also further. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulation competence for telephone conversations is not about the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA cancels possibly ban for certain electronic devices in start and landing </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Mark Rosenker of the traffic security authority said last month nationally Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS News, mobile phones would be regarded yet always as a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Mobile phone are actual a problem, not only because it potentially interferences in navigation devices cause could, but rather because we of the FCC know, that the transmission out of the air also envoy mast disturb can&quot;, so Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> A consultation committee of the industry, that was called by the FAA to the investigation of this subject into life, recommended last month that the government would permit a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In the last years, the pressure increased to the FAA to relax restrictions for the use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Critic such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill out of Missouri represent would be the view, there no valid safety reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the utilization of the devices became omnipresent. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> In some studies, the speech, that forgets or ignores to one-third of the passengers the disengaging of the device, is therefrom. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA began 1966 to restrict the utilization of electronic devices through flight traveler after reports had become on interferences of navigations and communication devices through UKW radios carried by passengers well known, that at that time the newest technology trend represented. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as earlier generations of aircrafts, but they are constructed also so and approves by the FAA that them electronic Interferenzen settle nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines have offered already for some years Wi Fi to passengers if the altitude is reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The flyers adapted at Wi-Fi-systems are also more insensible vis-à-vis Interferenzen. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The predominant majority of the passenger airplanes should be suited for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The current electronic devices give in general substantially less radio radiation from than earlier generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E Reader for example deliver only minimal radiation if one turns over. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> Yet in the downloading or sending of data, the transmission values are stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> To the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the device utilization through passengers, Amazon. com counts. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> 2011 loaded firm colleague of Kindle E Reader full a passenger airplane and made a test flight in order to determine problems, were able to assess however none. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings what concerns the risk in regards to the utilization of devices. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd of the passenger association nationally Association of airline Passengers said would be would be, it the view, the interference through the devices real, also if the risk would be minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other committee members said, there would be would be only isolated reports of pilots, that would speak for an interference about airplane systems through the devices, and that therefrom very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The committee recommended the FAA to be sure to permit it pilots, to arrange the disengaging of the devices in instrument landing under bad visibility ratios through the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A grouping out of the trip industry welcomed the changes and designated it as a sensible adaptation for traveler, who would be equipped today extensively with technology. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We please us, that the FAA recognizes, that a comfortable passenger experience not in the contradiction to the security stands&quot;, said Roger Dow, CEO of that Travel Association U.S. </seg>

<seg id="1765"> Most pigs are slaughtered with six months. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Television with level? </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Also details such as the ph of the meat play a role. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The darker the meat, the more highly the ph. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;There am I strained, if its Roberto Blanco measures, what then happens&quot;, so jumbo cynical. </seg>

<seg id="1773"> For: Black Forest ham is to be found traditionally without bone on the shelf. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Smoke tower and Rauchfeuerung remind one jumbo optically of a &quot;submarine&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> The trick: Fir branches provide here in the smoke for the special taste the Black Forest ham. </seg>

<seg id="1782"> With a narrow Kader, the Mr. I of the TSV joy city in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb had to begin. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> The Älbler stood to be sure with a learned team on the other network side. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Soon appeared however that they not entirely were able to keep up, also age-related, with the fast actions of the joy city-dweller. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> With the hard and placed had trouble impacts the Gönninger extremely. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Repeatedly they missed the passports passed by Simon tavern and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network middle and attacks and were in the block defense not to the place. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly the superiority of the joy city-dweller in all concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> In view of this earth moving and game certain achievement, the third sentence was won then somewhat lax and listless to the 3:0-Endstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22). </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Because on the 2nd of November with the TV Baiersbronn becomes, that clearly was able to prevail in Nagold, an opponent more high-performance substantially on the field stand. </seg>

<seg id="1792"> They delivered a hard fought over two-hour-Match. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Nervousness on both sides caused above all in the ball acceptance mistake and point gifts; also in the passports was the precision sometimes scarce commodity and in some critical game scenes prevented of the overzealousnesses the view for possible point profits. </seg>

<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: No absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want the inhabitants prematurely into the planning bind&quot;, opened mayor Jens Häußler the citizen information organization to the flood protection draft in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Approximately 80 participants had come into the community hall in order to be explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express objection and to bring in ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Häußler placed clearly: &quot;That in the end decisions fällen the members of the local council&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The flood, the Gechingen on the 15th of May 2009, unprepared encountered, had been an incisive event, that raised ask that about precaution for the future, so Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river zone investigation had been given with the neighbor community Aidlingen in order, that is now base for the flood protection draft in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;The protection if possible many cultivated plots of land is the goal&quot;, so Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Bottom put is the protection from a year statistical every 100 according to Germans weather service to expecting floods the planning. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The climate variation taken into account through a 15-percent extra charge. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> In circles of experts, this is designated with &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The water measures, that had led 2009 in Gechingen to considerable damages, corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;An absolute protection gives it not, but a relative improvement can we obtain&quot;, so Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> In order to obtain the protection HQ 100aKlima, must invest become in Gechingen approximately Four Million Euro whereby the community can reckon with country subsidies in height of approximately 70 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Häußler referred however on that that there only would be the support, if a total concept would be transferred. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> In addition the community would be directed on the cooperation of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> A costly planning procedure and permission procedure would have to be graduated. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> In the best case could be begun 2016 with the conversion. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Among other things the protection draft, that plans became presented (we reported) local measures in the influx of the river Irm out of the Stammheimer valley already in the past week in the local council. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> In the connection at the presentation of the flood protection draft, the participants used the opportunity to bring in its concern. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Among other things was questioned why no longer dams and back stop basin would be planned to the protection of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregor boldly, specialty plans of the delegated engineer office forest and Corbe out of hill home, that the draft introduced, emphasized that it would require the interaction of all introduced measures in order to reach the desired goal in the sum. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> In addition one would be held to find the most economic solution, so Joachim forest of forest and Corbe. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Displeasure ruled with residents of the old place, who have to suffer even in normal thunderstorm rain again and again from an overload of the canal network. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The problem is already were seized at the administration well known and first measures. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Häußler referred however on that that the guidelines would be for canal systems others, when for the flood protection and this mixed become not might. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The community would be obligated to display the canal network so that two-year until three-year rain events borne become could. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> To dimension the sewers more largely, would devour millions. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> That newly formed shines Opschlag with a new cafe. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> One that invites for lingering and coming back. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> One that would like to make the name to the program. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> As Déjà Vu, one designates according to lexicon a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling to have experiences or seen a new situation already once. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> In the case the visit of the of the same name café at the Opschlag in the district capital Kleve in visibility expanse to the university Rhine Waal, it doesn&apos;t have to remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> In the end the café with the beautiful name has exactly that as a goal: to make an actual stay not only intellectual, but rather strongly always recurring tangibly. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Because it is fun just and is simply beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A view into the thoughts and feelings at the Opschlag 8 gives the spectator on attempt a good feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to the Wohlfühlen. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo manufacturers fight in the face of large orders over seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Between leading airplane manufacturers, it came to a discussion over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-range flights, what indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubais Airshow this month. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The dispute revolves offered becomes around the seat width, the passengers in long flights in the tourist class – always that around which airlines strive most, but this expelled room does not place SOW the key for the efficiency statements in the newest airplanes of Airbus and Boeing Co. there. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus demanded says this week an industry standard, that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18-inch) in the tourist class, but the US American archrival Boeing, the airlines should decide that. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The discussion comes at a time because the airplane manufacturers to sell therefore rivalries, even larger versions of its zweimotorigen long-range flyers, and expect at the organization of that 17th until 21st of November of record orders. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> How the rear part of the airplane arranged is – especially whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives –, is decisively for the indicated economic results, that should deliver the new &quot;mini jumbo&quot; -to design. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing maintains, its modernized &quot;777X&quot; would grasp 406 people in seats in the tourist class, that extend are over 17-inch and permit so ten per row. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus explains, the competing version of the A350 conveys 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class whereby there are nine per row. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertising in the specialty press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Now Airbus appeals before the Dubais Airshow where the 777X with more than 100 orders will make presumably the race, directly at the public. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Did recently the business introduce a notice, that could be the start of a new notice war and showed financier a picture, in which three people sit bruised together in a restaurant, and in addition the title: &quot;would become you that accept&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;Boeing strikes long-range flights in seats before, that are narrower than regional Turbo Props&quot;, says Airbus sales and marketing boss John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> In view of changed eating, habits become the people thicker, but airplane seats did not change radically. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Between the early 1970ern when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range trip, and the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US health ministry. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The waist circumference of the masculine average American in the 21st century amounts to 100.8 cm according to US American health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says, its rival would comply with a seat draft out of the 1950ern when the average body circumference of the freshly baptized &quot;jet Set&quot; more narrowly was. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Have, so Airbus, investigations carried out, that covered, that a (2.54 cm additional customs would increase) per seat the sleep quality around 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing challenges the numbers of Airbus to the seat measures and says, it stands to not to decide in the estimating of the manufacturers how airlines form the balance between flight tariffs and arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The business explains would hang also, according to investigations the experience in the airplane of more than the seat width off. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> &quot;It runs really on that out, airline flexibility to give, so that it that do can, what it in its opinion must, around successful to be&quot;, clarifies the flight cabin experts Kent Craver of Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> They would not want that we dictate them, what makes it profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> They know its business better than every other. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers, it concerns more elbow freedom, but for manufacturer, it becomes in increasing mass of a subject, that can affect the revenues. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Behind the discussion, a race stands around airplane orders with an appreciated volume of at least 700 billion U.S. dollars after Listenpreisen in the coming decades, what could affect persistently the export balances of the USA or Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> How Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving power behind the discussion around the new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its newest zweimotorigen long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, that 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> The statements Boeings on the results depend partially therefrom that the 777X with its ten seats is compared per row to the original design by nine seats in the 777. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The increased costs per unit are always even slighter than in presently related machines with ten seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;Boeing bruises therefore more seats into its airplane, around it more competitive to our products to make&quot;, says Kevin Keniston, leader for passenger comfort in the European Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand analysts, full cabins with ten seats say pointed per row in available 777s on that there that many passengers decided on the narrower arrangement, what could walk with cheap flight tariffs. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;Eighteen-inch seat width would be crazy for passengers, but the reality is: of an economic viewpoint out of is the Airbus offer of the threat through the 777 driven&quot;, says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin arrangement, founder and publisher of Runway Girl network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but rather a catalogue of supplier out of which the airlines can select. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The world traveling jets salesmen carry even tape measure with itself, around which to check arrangement in the competition. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they extol the comfort, all manufacturers offer yet also jets with highly condensed arrangement for cheap airline and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen rows, sold however yet none according to own statements. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently Airbus emphasized how importantly more Anpassbarkeit of the cabins would be and offered for some jets wide seats at the gears. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only jet large modern other manufacturer, experts say that the call probably would explode after a new industry standard, but could distract by the wave of 777X-Verkäufen. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> The Veganismus is imputes according to lexicons the Vegetarismus, differs of this however yet on entirely considerable manner. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> For during vegetarian permit itself the consumption of creme pie, ice or a strong Edamer, stand these feast eggs not on the menu of a vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Milk, cheese, egg, next to the renunciation of meat and fish the vegan of the product animal all consumption lets from - also honey is denied. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> One likes to ask himself what remains,, but in nearer view, the vegane nourishment world draws itself through a notable ingenuity from. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Spreads are very chooses&quot;, explains Ute handle man, that proprietor of the local health food shop, who has ready a multitude of special products for vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Also Proctor rubbed visits the store in the cathedral lane gladly. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan lives finds, in Lampertheim he (almost) all before, what he needs for life. I shifted &quot;1997 my nourishment and became vegetarian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Around the century turning point resulted then the next step and I vegan became. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came however not only because of the nourishment, but rather based on the shoe choice&quot;, says Proctor, that art leather prefers leather normal. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> It recognized that it goes also in other daily concerns without animal products. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Primarily vegan is its ethics one. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I wants not, that animals for me die must&quot;, speaks Proctor the maxim of the vegans from, that extends on the entire consumption behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Mourn afterwards instead of castles, scrambled egg or Gummi Bears, had discovered climbed the vegan products quickly entirely new, the enthusiasm on. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;It is a double bonus&quot;, says Proctor today, &quot;actually places vegan its no renunciation, no asceticism there, but rather it is an enrichment&quot;. The acceptance that one would reduce the selection with the nourishment transposition at food option, attributes Proctor sooner to the power of the habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> And exactly these conditionings let fail also many a yet so well meant attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The Suchtfaktor is an entirely decisive factor, that many quickly abandon lets, similarly in the smoking&quot;, places Proctor a comparison up. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> And objects: &quot;Certain Geschmäcker are not to be fastened&quot; at the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Often the spices or the type of the preparation that settle the taste are it. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;One can however also in other manner the same effect produce&quot;, clarifies the vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> To a grill festival, Proctor brings along for example eggplant, mushroom and also a couple Veganwürste. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> It pays attention to a well-balanced, varied nourishment, with which it thoroughly also once heftily should taste. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Naturally one would like to have something between the teeth, is that legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It should taste, but that is not only on animal nourishment to reduce&quot;, so Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Health damages up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance, had not suffered it. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> For me, the transposition had a positive aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I receive no strange cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high performance athletes who eat excluding vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;My blood values are best, I let me often check&quot;, betrays Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Especially before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;There animals with lining means nourished become, instead of on the meadow grasses, is it questionably, whether in the meat, that one in the cool trunk buys, the Vitamin-B12-Anteil is high&quot;, finds Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For vegan, there is moreover the possibility to take the Coenzym in the form of tray to itself. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B12-Werte are in order&quot;, explains it. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Proctor didn&apos;t have to go far ways for the food procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> There is reason food in the end everywhere and every supermarket has meanwhile soya bean milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> All what I need, I find on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Only off and at I buy something special. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people survey that just only the finished products are expensive, but so it behaves in&quot; usual&quot; finished products of course also&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Anyway let the preparation be vegan of courts by far more favorable and less time-consuming when commonly supposed. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;In the house kitchen gives it much to discover, with a couple of small pinched can one good, if not partially better results obtain&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its veganen cheesecakes Proctor was able to bring also its Schwiegereltern for marveling. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> The vegan lends would spice family festivals a new. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> That has dynamics if one cooks together, has the one new status. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations, that at the same time emerge can, are as different as the people themselves&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Naturally scepticism was offered it however also already. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Does my meal taste you no longer? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Should I &quot;now badly feel because I drink&quot; milk? - In questions such one had to act as a vegan with fingertip feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I lean the people not off, I am part of this company&quot;, would like Proctor no enclave existence time periods. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And more exactly observed the everyday life world appears then not at all so veganfremd such as assumed - and the vegan not so in the everyday life restricted supposed how commonly. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Also almost Food is permitted. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> There is fry everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many Dönerläden offer Falafel on, or just a vegetarian Yufka&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> In a pizzeria, it switches over to Pastagerichte, or a pizza without cheese, all one question of the habit orders just. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The restaurants adjust themselves so slowly on that. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> &quot;As I 13 years ago begun still would have, me vegan to nourish, was all much more hard&quot;, foundly can make the New Zealander a development: &quot;One must speak with the people, make&quot; it aware. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;If sufficient demands come, are it perhaps in addition tended, the menu to supplement&quot;, hopes it. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Vegane restaurants develop, like for example the Kombüse in Mannheim or the café bird free. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Proctor cultivates the wish that also other restaurants have stand at least a veganes court on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> In the reason taken are vegane courts for everyone there. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> &quot;Meat courts are on the other hand exclusive, and to be sure in the truest sense of the word, for it conclude other from&quot;, places Proctor firmly. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> &quot;If one groceries scandals avoid wants, is certain Veganismus a way, the very largest part from the start impossibly to make&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The purchase vegan products could be somewhat difficult however at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Especially if one learns to understand, the additive animal also into peanuts as a color giver his contain can, seems to leave one with the compliance with the ethics in so many hurdles and falling quickly the courage. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Not only therefore have rubbed Proctor and Lars Thomsen a book written: &quot;Veganissimo - animal ingredients and its alternatives&quot; explains the many ingredients that are buried food however also cleaner. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> &quot;Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows has&quot; is to be done to pay attention to which signs and Logos one it sometimes better small steps as to stumble remain standing or&quot;, knows Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The Veganismus, it an important moral tip-off that strikes on the consciousness is. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Perhaps it does not create it entirely that one discards its habits, but it at least can teach the consumer to examine its habits critically. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Bavaria basketball in spite of first defeat optimistically </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to lessen in the basketballs of the FC Bavaria Munich the gigantic optimism. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> &quot;No one can us forbid on that to believe, also against the best team of Europe of the past both years to win&quot;, balanced Bavaria coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with title defender Olympiakos Piräus. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> We sent the messages: Also in Munich, basketball exists! </seg>
<seg id="1967"> In its first third entrance in the European king class of sold itself the citizens of Munich long very well, however simply were not clarified in the decisive phases enough. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> The guests created first of all the feat a 15-Punkte-Rückstand 15-Punkte-Rückstand point 15-Punkte-Rückstand residue 13 minutes before end yet into a leadership to transform before Piräus gave the game again a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> &quot;We have us incredibly fought back against the twice-repeated Euroleague champion, but then again foolish mistakes made&quot;, said Bavaria pro Yassin Idbihi. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> We are proud of our achievement, but we want to win each game. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the citizens of Munich that had celebrated in the first two parties against the Italian series master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra clear victories. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> New Anti-nicotine-vaccine could put an end to the pleasure in the smoking </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Scientists developed an Anti-nicotine-vaccine, that could ruin the joke at the smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice a life long against smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Before tests at the person, even further attempts are required, what can last a few more years, but professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said, the first results would be good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;We are very hopeful, that this type of vaccinate strategy once millions of smokers help can, that tried have to stop and there all methods available on the market tries have, but experience must, that its smoking is stronger than these extensions&quot;, so Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so, that it contains the genetic information to the manufacture of nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus infects selective the liver cell that produce then a permanent current of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain, by what means a smoker no nicotine High learns. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In attempts, vaccinated mice which nicotine was dispensed retained, its normal activity level. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Mice without vaccination on the other hand would have taken a &quot;time out&quot;, declared the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The experiments are described in the specialist journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibody. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The vaccinations so frequently had to be given to the maintenance of the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Yet the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, for it changes liver cell in antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> How professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could for people if he would be certain entire, children dispensed become before they ridden in temptation to try a cigarette, and so smoking prevent. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> More probable however is that smokers would use it in order to stop. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;You know then: If they to smoke begin again, they perceive because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure at the same time, and that helps them to discard that habit&quot;, clarifies it. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> British scientists said, the results would be interesting, warned however simultaneously, it would be even further research necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Guillaume Nicloux&apos; adaptation of the novel of Denis Diderot convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary detail, is to be sure also heavier food than necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> The action playing in the France the &apos;1760&apos;s tells the seizing story by Suzanne, a young nobleman, that is sent by its family into the cloister. </seg>

<seg id="1993"> The film never glides from in lustful-ness or sensation desire – and therein lies its problem. </seg>

<seg id="1995"> Egypt swears in first freely selected president </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Mohammed Mursi discards the oath of office, but might day the triumph the end the political disputes in Egypt be do not mean. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he was sworn in firster freely selected president of the country and began therewith the succession of Husni Mubarak, that 16 months had been banished before out of the office. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> With its inauguration before the uppermost constitutional court, Mursi became country chief fifth also the first freely selected Islamist president of the Arabic world and Egypt since the slump of the monarchy before years approximate 60. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> It discarded the oath before the 18 judges clothed into black gown of the court, that has its seat at the Nile and is empathized with an antique Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> &quot;We strive after a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic&quot;, said Mursi in the solemn ceremony, that was transmitted live in the national television. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> &quot;Today has the Egyptian people the foundation for a new life put – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability&quot;, said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Moslem fraternity, a fundamentalist group who had been taken since its foundation 84 years ago usually as a forbidden organization by the respective government sharply into the visor. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Hundreds of soldier and policemen of guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven o&apos;clock local time in a small car convoy. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Only a couple of hundred follower had met was stopped itself before the court in order to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential Prunk out of the Mubarak time the traffic only short-term so that the car convoy was able to cross the usually animated street, that connects the city center with the southern suburbs. </seg>

<seg id="2005"> &quot;Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern country&quot;, declared the Mursi clothed into a blue suit with red necktie the judges in the holzgetäfelten chamber in whom he discarded the oath of office. </seg>

<seg id="2007"> It was welcomed officially of an army chapel, listened that played the national anthem, that it in have eight position. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> The military leader field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present. </seg>

<seg id="2011"> Mursi discarded on Friday a symbolic oath on the Tahir place, that to reclaim birth site of the uprising, that last year to the end of the authoritarian domination Mubaraks led, and it praised, presidential power authorities, that the military advice of the head of state hunted out of the office had received. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> Yet with the discarding of the official oath before the court and like usually before the parliament he does not bend himself the will of the military what refers on that, that the power struggle will go on. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Mursis speech on the Tahir place was full dramatic populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> Nagold: Hugo Wermter since 60 years in the choir </seg>
<seg id="2015"> At 60 years of age as singer, Hubert Wermters story is at the man song society Cäcilia almost doubly as long as that of the Herbsfestes in whose frame he solemnly was honored. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Hubert Wermter stood lived how in the colors of its man song society on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Also after 60 years, the singing with the joke still large in the meantime probably more than dearly won choir makes it. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> In the society, Wermter was also active, among other things for 28 years as a member of the committee. </seg>

<seg id="2040"> It concerns the most faithful customers of Frontier, who would have expressed clearly, that it would become more heavily and more heavily to find place in the specialty over the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers, that buy your tickets on the websites of the airline, don&apos;t have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> That means that a passenger may bring a baggage piece at the gate of Frontier under circumstances free of charge, that next person must pay however 100 dollars for a comparable baggage piece. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O&apos; Malley explained, that changed would become website of Frontier and the Check-in-procedure, so that the passengers would be informed about the fee, before they would come to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The new carry-on luggage fee of Frontier steps not until the summer effective, gives an exact date it not yet. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers scold frequently over baggage extra charges and other fees, but airlines grasp gladly on that back. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> They argue that the carrier of the baggage money would cost and passengers should pay these services, if they wished it. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Many at the Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that the airline enough money take in in order to cover after years the losses the costs of flight trips. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> That let until now however the fingers of fees for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Spirit airline inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for carry-on luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a no-frills airline. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Let the only other airline with such a fee be the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline adviser Jay Sorensen that the addition fees pursues attentively. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> It appreciated in a report from December 2011 that the carry-on luggage fee Spirit would bring in annually 50 million US dollar. </seg>

<seg id="2061"> Airlines pay Online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per sold ticket. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> That delivers a stimulus to move passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an Online travel agency to all companies. </seg>

<seg id="2065"> On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again to 25 percent the flight stretch. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Esa decides over large space missions: Missions for billions </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Distant planets, gravitation waves or black holes - experts of the European space flight agency must agree now on two large projects, that want to start it in the next years. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 suggestions stood are to the selection, five yet in the race. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> More than 1000 planets in other stars already found astronomer. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Whether there is life at least on some of them, knows no. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The selection falls heavily: Should one search for gravitation waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Investigate or rather the origin of the cosmos? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Search or after earth similar planet and discover therewith perhaps extraterrestial life? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> These questions stand just the responsibles of the European space flight agency Esa. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For its program &quot;Cosmic vision&quot; they seek ideas for two large space flight projects, that should advance the cause of the research decisively. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such &quot;L missions&quot; is respectively about about a billion Euro. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The start will be presumable 2028 and 2034. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Beginning of September met in Paris the elite of the European space research in order to discuss suggestions for such missions. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were came up for debate, five therefrom now into the narrower choice. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Numerous groups appraise the suggestions, hook at the researchers after. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> In the next days, a final decision should fall through the scientific program committee. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> The Esa selected altogether four large questions, on which the missions of the 2007 initiated program &quot;Cosmic vision&quot; answers should find. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the origin of planets and life? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact processes in the origin of stars out of large gas clouds - and therewith also the origin of planets, that these stars circle - lie still in the proverbial dark. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A large infrared telescope in that all this darkly could permeate. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Does and if a star planets possess, under which circumstances life can emerge there? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In order to investigate this question, the space telescope &quot;Cheops&quot; should start 2017, with which 500 already well known planet systems in our nearer environment more exactly are examined. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The possibilities are limited however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With larger instruments, the astronomers could portray earth similar planets and could analyze even the composition of its atmospheres and search so for &quot;organic markers&quot; : Gases that apply as an indication to biological activity. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system function? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Also this question should give last of all information about that, which prerequisites there are for the origin of life. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> An important roll plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation outgoing by it with the planet system. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot;, the Esa allowed already a mission of the M class (there is the budget about about a half billion Euro) for this question. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe should start 2017 and exactly should observe surface and activity of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Of large interest for the researchers, also Jupiter and its moons are. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> They want to find out, whom roll played the giant planet in the development of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> For that the Esa plans the first of the altogether three L missions of the &quot;Cosmic vision&quot; -program. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The probe &quot;Juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons explorer) begins its trip presumably 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> It later reaches eight years Jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the basic physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether that confessed nature laws there still validly are to us. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Perhaps also deviations, that could the physicists the way to a new theory of wise, are found, under whose roof all well known nature laws can be united. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> How did the universe emerge and from where it exists? </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Before 13.7 billion years, our cosmos was caused by the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Next to matter familiar us, out of the stars, planet and living thing how we exist, gives it dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy pile, and dark energy by whose causing the expansion of the universe speeds up. </seg>

<seg id="2231"> With a special telescope, the probe should examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time at the entire sky and should enable so conclusions on the state of dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could make the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the 30 suggestions will remain at the end of the selection procedure only two remaining. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> The best chances for a permission as a L mission &quot;E Lisa&quot;, a demanding draft to the proof of gravitation waves has in the opinion of many experts. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Under that physicists understand changes in the structure of the room time that Albert Einstein had predicted before almost 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Proved became it until today not. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could create that, hope the scientists behind the project. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission plans one out of two or three probes existing detector, that becomes all stationed in that. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It could prove in contrast to plants on the earth also gravitation waves, could deliver that emerged in the Big Bang, and so new insights over the origin of the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Four further suggestions compete yet around the second L mission: a large x-ray telescope by the name of &quot;Athena&quot; that should investigate among other things black holes, &quot;Icy planet it&quot;, a further mission to the external planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism&quot;, a mission to the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and that &quot;exoplanet Finder&quot; that earth similar planets should track down and examine. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Already eliminated are suggestions to the rehearsing back carrier of Mars among other things, to the investigation of moon, Venus and asteroid as well as to sun physics. </seg>

<seg id="2314"> Most citizens could such a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favorable than predicted receive. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;You come a better offer&quot;, said it. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The government designated it as few surprisingly that the five percent of the population that locked even an insurance would have to look around themselves, after one other tariff, because its contract would not correspond after the Affordable Care Act to the new standard. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;I would like to say very directly to these Americans: They earned better&quot;, said Sebelius in a hearing before the energy shot and trade sow shot of the House of Representatives in Washington. </seg>

<seg id="2324"> Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is acknowledged for children, who were born with not unambiguous genital. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> New-born is shown no longer stare man-like or femininely. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> After the new law, parents must declare no more sex to be such children, but rather can determined&quot; indicate &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;not on the birth document. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> It that pressure of parents to take is rushed make must goal of the law, therewith it none decisions with regard to operations for a sex assignment in new-born, and to fight the discrimination of intersexuellen people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> An intersexuelle person said according to BBC years later: &quot;I am neither man nor woman&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I remain mutilates the botch that was created by physicians, and full scar. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Approximately each year comes one of 2,000 children neither as a boy yet as a girl to the world. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> They belong to the Intersexuellen, a group, that fall under the diagnosis &quot;sexual differentiation interference&quot; (DSD), a collecting concept for people with atypical chromosomes, germ gland (ovaries or testicle) or unusually developed genital. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexuell. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> The understanding of the sex identification is developed advise yet always not very well, but most experts in the USA in addition, one should use the best available information to the sex assignment if a determination would not be possible, and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before one would decide – if at all – on an operation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> That Jack thresher New York psychiatrist Dr., who specialized in the problematic nature of the sex identification, said &quot;would sound, the new German law after a good thing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Intersexuelle children represent an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> &quot;Many people have life-threatening diseases, that a surgical intervention required make, but for most children counts that not&quot;, said he. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> One could a sex assignment without operation of distinguished and then await how the identity would develop. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data about how a child develops generally its sexual identity, are not very exact. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> No one knows why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It is like the secret why people are homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report at the European commission from the year 2011 it is named are to be distinguished, intersexuelle people from train oil sexual or Transgender people, for its status would not be stipulated gender-related, but rather through its biological constitution, would be defined, that is neither exclusively man-like yet feminine, but rather characteristically both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These characteristics appeared in nachrangigen sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statue, priority sexual characteristics such as propagation organs and genital or in chromosome structures and hormone. </seg>

<seg id="2350"> The US American websites Catholic Online talked things out also against the German law, with the establishment: &quot;if the world into a new condition tugged becomes, where the sex a decision represents, sexual activity however not, distort we two further columns of the civilization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a new-born out of Maryland declared vis-à-vis baby zone, it it would find better if baby would be shown in the birth a sex. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;The parents existence is also without further restrictions already stressful enough, especially if one the sex of the own child does not know&quot;, said it the parents websites. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Historically seen became children, who were born with masculine and feminine genitals, when Hermaphroditen designates, after which attractive Greek God whom both sexes had. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Yet ten years ago observed the medicine the sex as something, that one extinguish and then newly construct could. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Yet in the meantime the ethical bases of an operation are disputed after now well known is, how complex the sexual identity is, and that physicians also incorrectly can lie, because they do not know, how the child feels in the growing up with the sex shown by them. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> One named &quot;middle of the 20th century the one, psychiatric emergency&apos;&quot;, said thresher. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If such a child was born, one did not call the psychiatrist, but rather the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The ruling theory over the treatment of children with not unambiguous genital is due to Dr. John Money of the Johns Hopkins University, whom the view represented, let the sex be mouldable. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> It stamped the concept identity&quot; &quot;sexual and argued, social and environmental impetus – like the parents a child raise – interacted with the genes and hormone of a child and stamped so whether a person femininely would regard herself as masculine or. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Yet in a case well known become under the title &quot;John/Joan&quot; from the year 1966 its theories became controversial. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> It advised castrate the parents of a boys, whose penis had been detached in a verpfuschten circumcision, the child very to and to remove also its testicles and to raise it then as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;Money presented this case as a successful example for a transformation, what it however was not&quot;, so thresher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When the boy about 15 was, he changed back to the masculine sex and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> With 38 however it committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to thresher, there are yet always physicians who would become this model practice. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Yet in the &apos;1990&apos;s, with which entrance of the Internet, stepped surviving of these sex operations at the public, that are not &quot;happy with the result&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Author old so about in Jim Bruce, a 36 year out of Montana, that was born with XY masculine chromosomes, but ambiguous genital. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The physicians were not themselves clearly about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced, he never could lead a &quot;satisfying life&quot; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Therefore became be external organ and the testicles shortly after the birth 1976 surgically removes and was raised it as girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> In the age of 12, it received feminine hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> &quot;I knew, that I no girl am&quot;, explained it vis-à-vis ABCNews. com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unfortunate, but it was really heavy to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> In the age of 18, it should receive a vaginal plastic. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> Yet there it was depressive and knew that somewhat did not agree, demanded it its medical acts. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What it out found, was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilized in my birth – and none said that ever to me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD, through which its body was able to produce not enough testosterone to the development of the genital. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After it had learned the truth, it changed again to the masculine identity, received testosterone injection and let itself remove its breasts. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Through the operation, it became infertile. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today it fights for other in an organization by the name of interface Project that intersexuelle people are perceived as normal. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Yet Anne Tamar Mattis, manager of the right group resident in California Advocates for Informed Choice, provides itself that the German law could encourage&quot; &quot;for stamping and stigmatizing. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> &quot;Many activists are provided that the German decision parents could encourage to make fast decisions and the child on not to show determined&apos;&quot;, explained it. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We fear, that favors interventions. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think to show it would be better, the masculine or feminine sex and to await then. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Yet yet we do not know how the law will have an effect, therefore we only can speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar Mattis said, its organization would support the Australian law, for adult enables &quot;it the recognition as a third sex&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> &quot;Adult should in a position be, own decisions on its legal sex to encounter&quot;, explained it. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> In the German law, it concerns the assignment in the birth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> That is no battle to which one should force small children at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> If they are adult, it itself can decide over its body. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Yet Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login out of Pittsburg, that a daughter with a sexual differentiation interference has and hundreds supports other in a self-help group, says, the German law &quot;would authorize&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with masculine chromosomes, has however a DSD by the name of complete Androgenresistenz. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the receptor defect of the goal cell for testosterone, Katie developed feminine characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> It has a vagina, but no Uterus and no ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Today Katie 29 is and marries; it works at the University of Pennsylvania as a colleague in the child psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> To be sure it is infertile, hopes to be sure to be able to get through adoption or a lend mother a child. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;The law gives parents room, by what means it not precipitate decisions encounter must&quot;, said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> It provides them the time to make different tests and to clarify things and gives them so time before they write &quot;man-like&quot; or &quot;femininely&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this manner all in order is – one raises the child and loves it. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents good fortune. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And one doesn&apos;t have to rush undertake a operation, make lets himself that no longer annulled. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;That closes the children into the decision with on and removes the anxiety, that parents worries, because it the opinion are, it would become not the correct do&quot;, clarified it. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> In the end decides fits the child over the sex, that better to it – and that is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Through it children are transferred into the situation to make the decision itself. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellently the battle mastered </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Horst Janson is cut the roll of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novel &quot;the old man and the sea&quot;, on the body. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Janson is even an old rabbit in its profession, the drama. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> The old man Santiago can show no in the fishing somewhat. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> So supplement itself both simply magnificently. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> One means almost, the folds in the nape of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks, to be able to see. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> If Santiago sits bended tiredly of life on the chair, that is real in Janson. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Beside it the roll of the old fisherman is through and through a character roll, that excellently masters Janson. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man that does not abandon and wins in the end the battle against the fish through its knowledge and also its will strength. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Janson is in far stretches as an alone performer on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> It creates it, that to focus attention of the audience on itself, so that its monologues are boring no moment. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Its exertions to pull the fish finally at the surface of the water, are so really that the spectators forget, that the sea consists yet only of blue illuminated water bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Director Jens Hasselmann lets act the old man in the boat before the fisherman village. </seg>

<seg id="2420"> The four musicians play Kubas rhythm in addition and are at the same time guests of the bar. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Does desire on ice cream, that illuminate in the dark? </seg>
<seg id="2422"> A British entrepreneur developed the ice illuminating not until the dark – with the help of by jellyfishes. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescing characteristics of the marine creatures and created from that an illuminating delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The idea in addition came it after it had read a research project over jellyfishes and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the illuminating protein artificially. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The ice cream reacts in the consumption with the tongue by what means the pH is raised in the protein and the illumination is released. </seg>

<seg id="2507"> The throw-away society does not think </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The night was long, that music loudly and the mood well, but sometime it goes home. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger seat and back seat, the hunger becomes apparent. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Clearly, for that the one or other cocktails or sparkling wine responsibly likes to be! </seg>
<seg id="2511"> Go to what more closely lies there, than a gechillt to the next Drive in, in order to grant itself a trifle? </seg>
<seg id="2512"> I admit, I am gladly with there if it goes spätnachts or early in the morning at the fast food getting. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> A couple of fry, a Cola, a castle - and then nothing like from home and into the bed! </seg>
<seg id="2514"> Yet on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry discos gears become apparent. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> For what must be missing one that one with constant regularity its fast food paper bags out of the car window wirft?! </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Above all at the weekends, thrown away paper paper bags lie at roadsides and on parking lots. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> &quot;Why do?&quot;, ask I me. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Are the people too dumb in order to take the paper bags home or more precisely to the next trashcan? </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It is not only so that the paper thing the landscape verschandelt. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Paper bags covered also already traffic arrangements such as guardrails and released through it accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Over so what thinks purported &quot;throw-away society&quot; however not after, probably knows it not once, what actually means this word. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If one evenings more often underway is, first quite with several people in the car, knows one, like a back seat after celebrated through nights look can: Clothes, bottles and other rubbish are piled up there. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> There more or less yet also would nothing settle a couple of paper bags - in contrast to the street where no on the meal remainders of other trample around wants. </seg>

<seg id="2525"> Milk overview and egg of alternatives in the overview </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Vegane nourishment requires vegetable alternative to eggs, milk and milk products. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Pürierter Tofu with plant creme is for example some curds replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The vegetarian alliance to the Weltvegantag names further on the 1st of November. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The vegetarian alliance Germany proposes a row of veganen of alternative on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on the 1st of November: </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Let pure plant margarine be a good alternative to butter, yogurt let replace by soya bean yogurt. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Instead of milk, soya bean milk, oats milk, almond milk or rice milk to the use could come. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Impact bar plant creme replaces conventional blow creme. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Also to eggs, there is vegetable alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> A half crushed, can replace ripe banana for example an egg as a bandage means in a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Also 50 grams of Apfelmus or a tablespoon of tablespoon of water ground linseeds plus three suit themselves for that. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Loose doughs become instead of with egg for example with a mixture out of a teaspoon baking powder, a tablespoon food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> But also 50 grams of soya bean yogurt or Seidentofu can fulfill this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> According to the Vebu, round 800,000 people vegan eat in Germany presently, therefore purely vegetable. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> A Blackbox in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2540"> US American street plans is believe found in search of a money source in order to repair the decaying Highway system, and the solution in a small black box to have, that in the instrument panel of each car place finds. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices, that record every gone kilometer and report the information at the authorities, to revise are essential point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the states, the obsolete system of streets US American to the financing. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The zone rather boring normally of the street planning has kindles suddenly an intensive debate with colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertarian allied and speak itself with environment groups itself for that from that the government can use the small boxes for recording the gone kilometers – and possibly also, where it gone became – and can use the information then for the calculation of tax modest. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Tea party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American civil right union (ACLU) is provided also deeply and expresses a row of data protection objection. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Yet during one in the congress on an action do not agree can, wait several states not more long. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> They test presently how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system, with which drivers pay per gone mile. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of drivers already tested the tachographs, of which some with GPS supervision are equipped. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> That is must actual a for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;It is nothing, that we only possibly use become&quot;, said Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern Californias Assn. of Governments, that plans a record of the gone miles at all Californian drivers in the state from 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The type and manner how we pay these taxes, will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology for that is there. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The initiative comes at a time because the Highway trust finding that is financed out of the taxes is, that US Americans pays at the gasoline pump, broke. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Yet in America, so much is refueled no longer like earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars consume less gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The national mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Euro cents per liter) did not climb for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians do not venture in high Spritpreisen to raise the tax also only around a cent. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> &quot;The gasoline tax is simply not future capable&quot;, so lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Its state equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs, with which a mile been based pay system is supposed to be tested. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;That places the long-termed most meaningful alternative there&quot;, said it. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats designate it as a mile been based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> It do not surprise that the idea finds in municipal liberal accord, for the tax could be used for example in addition to influence the driving behavior so that obstruction and climate harmful exhaust fumes are reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Californian plans set on the system in the elaboration of strategies, with which the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state are supposed to be reached to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Yet the republican Bill Shuster out of Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, explained also that he would see therein the most passable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Also the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are done of the idea let pay driver after traversed stretch. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;That is no tax, that in a black hole disappears&quot;, explains Adrian bogs, vice president for guidelines in Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> The people pay directly for that, what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is supported also of two earlier American transportation ministers, who had requested the congress in a report in 2011, to move toward mile been based statement. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Year approved last the US senate a pilot project expensive 90 million dollars that would have comprised 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Yet the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the attack and reacted therewith on the objections of delegate out of rural zones, that people represent, who must traverse many miles in the everyday life often on the way to the work or into the city. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Several states and cities move nevertheless independently into this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Most engagly Oregon, that presently 5,000 drivers recruits for the largest experiment of the country, is. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax at the state. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada locked already a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York city considers also such a. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois tests it in restricted mass with truck. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I-95-Koalition, to which the transportation ministries of 17 states belong at the east coast, examines presently how one could introduce the change. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The draft is no universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada where recently 50 volunteers with the devices were equipped, were driver sceptical in the thought, the government could pursue each of its movements. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> &quot;Consider against Big Brother and such things were a large problem&quot;, explains Alauddin Khan, leader of the strategy management and result management in the transportation ministry of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its websites: &quot;it would be relatively simple, the tachographs into fully grown supervision devices to change&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There was no necessity to construct a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure, that would become inevitable in addition relatedly to grasp data over the daily movements of individual. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada does not belong to a row of states, that hold now after affordable technology lookout, with which the country can grasp the gone kilometers, but exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Therewith, so Khan, would be also the public more calmed. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The hunt after this technology led some authorities to a small Startup business by the name of True Mileage in California. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The firm not originally is begun in order to help states in the taxation of drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Rather it was its goal of getting an in a soaring market for motor vehicle insurances foothold, with which drivers should pay on base of the gone miles. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Yet that of its devices of tested are not work also for the street plans interesting, for it with GPS and deliver only limited information that become high loaded regularly per modem. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;The people are rather ready, itself on that to involve, if its speed and locations not recorded become&quot;, explained Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> In some of these public pilot programs, large mistakes were made. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There are substantially cheap and less intrusive possibilities to transfer this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon, the plans experiment therewith to give drivers a row of choices. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> They can for a device with or without GPS decide. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or they select generally no device and pay instead a flat rate on base of the miles gone on the average by all inhabitants the state. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Other places hope to be able to sell the draft of a distrustful public in that they equip the devices with more functions than with wenigeren. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> In New York city traffic officials want to develop a device to the taxation, pays will must, with which also parking fee can be paid, an insurance only for gone kilometers and raised become speed data by other vehicles in real time, avoid can driver thanks to those obstruction. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> &quot;Driver would become through that value-added the advantages, that the system offers, the participation motivates&quot;, is named it in a planning document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Some traffic plans ask themselves to be sure whether the entire talk would be over the paying per mile not only a gigantic diversionary tactic. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> The problem of the bankrupt Highway trust finding could solve official declared in the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the zone the San Francisco Bay, the congress simply by increase of the fuel tax. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> An additional unique fee or an annual duty could be imposed drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles who consume little gasoline, so that also these pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> &quot;It gives no reason for an operation, if an aspirin also suffices&quot;, clarifies Randy Rentschler, the leader for legislation and public matters of the commission. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers make provide itself over its privacy and numerous other things. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Bath drought home: A dream becomes true for the FC </seg>
<seg id="2605"> At the meaning for the city and the soccer club, the official inaugural celebration forfeited nothing for the art lawn sport field in spite of the cold weather and the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> A more comfortable celebration hour probably everyone had wished for at the past Saturday, but Petrus did not want to play at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> So all that were left empty-handed that came without umbrella or were not able to hold such one out of any a reason. </seg>

<seg id="2614"> Further words of welcome spoke for the municipal Sportausschuss Hubert Baier, the district chairperson of the south soccer association, Kuno Kayan, Baden and Friedrich Knorr about the planning office that a contribution announced for the youth department of the club. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Mayor Klumpp brought in memory that always recurring weather contingent influences in the spring and autumn added so to the original lawn place, that he not recorded on. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to the solution of the problem when at the building of a third place in the terrain of the soccer club or in the secondary school at the Salinensee thought became. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> Both was rejected again. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Six years ago thoughts arose to the application of an art lawn sport field, what was looked at generally as the given as an ultimatum solution. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Concrete plannings were received two years ago when the FC the Schabelstube in inherit lease received, some costs participation of 100,000 Euro for the building of the place accepted and approved the country subsidy of 104,000 Euro. </seg>

<seg id="2875"> A copy of the soon appearing book exists the Times and it reported on Thursday evening that the Topberater of the president would have carried out &quot;extensive group sessions and surveys end 2011&quot; to find around out whether it better would look fading hope for re-election for Obamas, if he would let bathed fall. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book draws thoroughly the story of the efforts of leading colleague the campaign and the white house after, nominally the earlier White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure, which effect it would have on the survey values, to trade the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the vice president. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> The potential change was an exertally watched secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Only a half dozen of the narrowest advisers of the president – including Daley, the earlier campaign leader Obamas, Jim measuring, and the earlier leading advisers of the white house, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew over the angedachten change. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> In &quot;Double Down&quot; is maintained had stood, Daley at the tip of the efforts, bathed to exchange in spite of its &quot;narrow, personal ratio&quot; before one decided in the end against such a gambit, after the data showed, that the candidacy of Clinton would not improve&quot; &quot;the chances Obamas authoritatively. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Daley confirmed in an interview with Martin that the government actually had considered, bathed to replace by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> &quot;I expressed a whole series of things, that one in deliberation pull should, and that was one of them&quot;, explained Daley the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Must one call himself in memory that the president had at that time terrible survey values, therefore we thought: &quot;for God&apos;s sake, what make we&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2883"> While Daley designated the investigations as an &quot;offered care&quot;, Martin said vis-à-vis Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expense had been operated to find around out whether such a train would pay itself with regard to the choice urns. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> &quot;In campaign becomes not so much money for surveys and focus groups issued, if one not seriously over somewhat thinks&quot;, explained Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> It is to be sure not clearly whether Obama knew, that its team thought about an exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Martin said vis-à-vis CNN, it had asked Daley whether its at that time boss would have known over the potential change. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Although Daley explained, it would believe not that himself the president of the possible variation &quot;was aware&quot;, admitted the earlier rod boss, it would be &quot;possible&quot; been that Obama had known therefrom. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; would deliver no definitive answer to the question, whether the political probes Obamas desk would have reached. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Cooper asked Martin whether it seriously would think, Obama had known nothing of the investigations about whether one should bathed fall let in the choices. </seg>

<seg id="2892"> Always if it concerns in local council sessions the household, mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The Gemeindesäckl in stove cheeks Schönach is filled well and has known guilt the administration already since 2005 no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Also that fiscal years 2012 can be booked in this sense as a full success. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> This became in the presentation of the year calculation for 2012 clear. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> How Andrea Rothmund clarified, the administration household with approximately 7.6 Million Euro more highly had fallen out than planned over a million Euro. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Also the excess of the administration household lies with about 1.8 million Euro round a million Euro over the extension. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> To owe would be the excess above all higher business tax collections and the community share at the income tax. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Also the fortune household lay again clearly over the planned values. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Instead of the planned 1.5 million Euro, it amounted to 2.5 million Euro in the past year. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;This lies essentially at the higher conveyance out of the administration household&quot;, so Rothmund. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Because in the fiscal year 2012 less investments were handled than planned, also the reserve conveyance more highly fell out. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> Altogether the general reserve could be increased around approximately 2.1 Million Euro on now altogether 4.9 million Euro. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> &quot;Such a work shakes one not simply out of the sleeve&quot;, praised Gerster with view of the year calculation. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> It and the local councils were happy evidently about the good numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> It paradoxically likes to sound, but exactly these good numbers the citizens could come to stand soon expensively. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Through the good financial state, the community in the past was able to forgo high assessments rates. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Through it again subsidies had been shortened however according to Gerster already often by the country. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> For these subsidies out of various balance canes, there are prerequisites. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Among other things the cities and communities that apply for subsidies must, certain assessments rates share. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> &quot;The subject of assessments rates must we us regard, because in the coming years investments stand, for that we gladly subsidies would have&quot;, gave notice Gerster in this context on. </seg>

<seg id="2922"> The blockade politics does not excuse the websites problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Let Obamas memoirs over the campaign 2008 be a sad memory of that what would have been possible </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Nathaniel P. Morris is student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> I read presently a terribly sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> It is a book of which I believed, it would become during the gloomy second year of my medical studies aufheitern and me again hope give me. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> It is named &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (courage to win) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas to the presidential election 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> If I am evenings with my patient written records ready and go to bed, me the keep the books back into a time when the politics was able to steal millions inspired and a speech the breath. </seg>

<seg id="2931"> A young team of visionary was was on the way into the white house and the nation ready for variation. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> When at that time 2008 Obama changed into the office, it had approval value of 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> And then latch I the book. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> To shift again on the present an evil awakening is as if one is torn out of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – it seem to be one vaguely memory, a sad admonition at missed possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In the years since I delivered for the first time my voice, changed actually something. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But it is simple nothing what I would have been able to introduce me. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I acknowledge the magnificent and multilateral things, that Obama reached, of the dismissal of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military deduction out of Iraq, the end of the forced concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> Also I am the view that the party-political blockade tactic had tipped over too many strivings, with which our nation should be brought forwards: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay in order to name only some. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Yet after I defended countless times the Obama government vis-à-vis colleagues and acquaintance, I arrived with my explanation attempt at the end. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The republican blockade politics cannot explain why one allows the monitoring of foreign country chief or the killing of innocent children through drones in overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It cannot explain why that gathers nationally Security Agency data over the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower are punished, that disclose national false behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It cannot explain why Anwar al Awlaki, a US American citizen was murdered, without procedure, yet why the public financing boundaries and edition boundaries during the presidential elections gone around become. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It does not justify the results of a report in which it is named, let the exertions of the white house to the immobilization of the media be that &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon government&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And jüngstens cannot excuse it the inability to sketch a simple website in the more than three years since the dismissal of the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I do not know whether it is that, what I should have expected. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Whether I should have understood with 18, that the government work could contradict that its campaign preceding political. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> The delegate office is obvious no foreseeable course because an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre stamp the public discussion. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Yet if I look at the examples named above, they seem selected extensively by the government itself to be. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> And that disturbs me most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I selected 2012 again Obama, not because I was enthused over its candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> If Romney avoided placed a confusing and unausgegorene alternative there, it did not seem determine its direction and positions to can. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> I had, freely of the pressure of future choices, would fulfill the impression, a second tenure for Obama the hope, belong had we of that already so long. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> Yet with the sinking of the approval values for Obama on less than 45% this week the return became into the year 2008 through this book the harder. </seg>
