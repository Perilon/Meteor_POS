<seg id="95"> Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with treating hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="96"> In the west-African country there are not many doctors, only one, for 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="97"> You vote here or with your mobile from </seg>
<seg id="98"> Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs too the top 10 of the „CNN Heroes of 2013&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="99"> They can agree for it or one of the other heroes in the top 10, to choose around it to the „CNN hero of the Year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The winner receives 250,000 dollars for the continuation of his extraordinary work </seg>
<seg id="101"> For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father lost the consciousness again and again and traveled to hospitals which did not have the means in order to help him. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Jamef Bwelle was hurt by Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981 at a car accident near. </seg>
<seg id="103"> First he had only a broken arm, however, then an inflammation which expanded onto his brain and a Hämatom which should influence it for the rest of his life caused there formed itself. </seg>
<seg id="104"> „There were not any neurosurgeons in Cameroon&quot;, according to Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="105"> We would have brought it out from Cameroon if we had had the money. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Instead of this Bwelle spent years with accompanying his father in full clinics and hospitals in order to get the treatment which they had to offer there. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Bwelle comments, „It is not simple </seg>
<seg id="108"> One can leave at five o&apos;clock the house in the morning and run that to the hospital in order to be the First and nevertheless First is not. </seg>
<seg id="109"> There are many patients. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Some people even die because they must wait. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The situation hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In Cameroon there is only a doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="113"> On the other hand the relation is in the United States near a doctor for 413 persons. </seg>
<seg id="114"> However, even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Live two of five people in the country below the poverty border and are almost three quarters of the health editions in the country private. </seg>
<seg id="116"> „The only problem which they have is the poverty&quot;, says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy the life. </seg>
<seg id="118"> To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering let mature in Bwelle the decision to undertake something against that. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out in the last year 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="120"> He became even doctor and works as a vessel surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In addition he based a non-profit organization by the name of ASCOVIME who travels to rural areas at weekends and offers there free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Since 2008 it and his volunteer group have helped just 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Almost every Friday it and up to 30 people squeeze themselves into minibuses and go the verschnürten medical outfit on the roof about unfortified terrain into the villages that require help </seg>
<seg id="124"> Not always everything goes by smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Already more than once they had to shift the vehicles through rivers and sludge </seg>
<seg id="126"> However, if they arrive, they are received as heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation which the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In these villages free medical care is really a reason for the celebrating and Bwelle – with his wide smile and his boundless energy – is there gladly during the cheerful celebration. </seg>
<seg id="128"> At the next morning the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="129"> „Per journey we treat 500 persons&quot;, according to Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="130"> You come from a vicinity round the village from 60 kilometers – and that on foot. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a series of fields </seg>
<seg id="132"> Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transferable illnesses. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – not simply be able to afford a document that is necessary for the school, however, many poor families. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the evening the team carries out simple operations with local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="135"> The operations occur usually in a school, the city hall or an apartment; according to the intervention the patients get up and go into the recovery field in order to do place for the next one. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The light for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday work. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It is a hard workload but the village musicians help usually with holding the team in a motivated way. </seg>
<seg id="138"> „You drum the whole night so that we remain awake and can continue our work says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday the team drives back then into the city, tired, but proud of the achieved work </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out in the last year 700 free operations and knows that it causes an enormous difference with their work for the people who it helps. </seg>
<seg id="141"> A man declared that the free operation of an inguinal hernia which he received makes to work again for him possible now. </seg>
<seg id="142"> „That changes the future of my family&quot;, thought the man. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Next to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle works also at night in private clinics in Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="144"> With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations. </seg>
<seg id="145"> „I do really not know when he sleeps&quot;, says Katie O&apos;Malley, who studies in the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelles group. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is always in the hospital either or attempts to raise money for the organization so that it can go onto these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medicine and nursing students as O&apos;Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experiences which they would never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="148"> „We can be in the case of operations in this case, where we help, to dab blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle&quot;, declaredly O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring along frequently donated Sanitätsmaterial. </seg>
<seg id="151"> If they are, however, first once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transportation and the instructions. </seg>
<seg id="152"> „He is completely a hero without doubts&quot;, says O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> It dedicates his life of this organization and his wish, to help the Cameroonian nation, does not know any borders </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a load. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Helping to others to a happier life and giving that to a promise which it gave to his father prepares great joy for him. </seg>
<seg id="156"> „I am so happy if I do this work thinks Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope, he sees what I do. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I do it in order to make people laugh again and in order to ease the pains. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Go to the web site of ASCOVIME and find out how you can help. </seg>

<seg id="162"> Pope Franziskus will call on 22nd February for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic church as the Vatican announced on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Cardinals are the rank-highest clergymen in the Catholic church after the Pope and they that elect a Pope so that Franziskus in this way will appoint the first group of men that finally will participate during the choice of his successor are it also. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Currently there are 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="165"> However, a cardinal that an old man of 80 years reached cannot participate anymore in the pope election – that falls to a group from 120 „elective cardinals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="166"> In a declaration in which the information was announced padre Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said a meeting of all cardinals will occur before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals is kept off which is known also as a Konsistorium. </seg>
<seg id="167"> „Papst Franziskus decided on announcing his decision for the calling of the Konsistoriums in February in advance in this way other meetings, that&quot; the participation of cardinals from all world require&quot;, be able to be planned, Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the elective cardinals until February will probably have sunk. </seg>
<seg id="169"> It declared the number of the elective cardinals again in this way a Pope appoints usually as many cardinals as necessarily in 120 is, and as many cardinals above 80 as it would like. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The Konsistorium in the next year is important, because it is the First since the choice of Franziskus in March this year&apos;s, so Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Currently there is a certain overhang of aufseiten Europe and in particular Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> „It will be interesting&quot; he said „to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to reconstruct the balance&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, however, they have only a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The cardinals will be also the First ones to be called since the education of the council of the cardinals based by Franziskus for finding a group of eight cardinals from the whole world that has the task possibilities for the reformation of the church. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In the past the Pope decided on everything alone. </seg>
<seg id="176"> „Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals who are supposed to help him&quot;, said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It declared it is „well possible&quot; that Franziskus the cardinals around council please. </seg>
<seg id="178"> However up to now we were not in this situation – that is everything very again. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Valero said that the bishops would appoint as cardinal typically from big places, nevertheless Franziskus of „full surprises&quot; puts „– we do not know therefore who he appoints&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="185"> Is it ready to Europe&apos;s elite to do businesses with Great Britain? </seg>
<seg id="186"> Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring the economy onto a table and to define, which those ones that provide prosperity and work in Great Britain would like to change at our relationships to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Too we commissioned the greatest and most comprehensive inquiry to this purpose among British economic leaders and they asked what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="188"> YouGov consulted more than 1,000 managers from the economy, that into about instance the British enterprise sizes, -sectors and show regions </seg>
<seg id="189"> The results of the inquiry will surprise many. </seg>
<seg id="190"> We found out that meanwhile the predominant majority of the enterprises exports outside of Europe and concentrates on countries that modernize and increase while the states are stagnating in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You want that from government page new commercial connections with countries as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of stopping oneself with the long and hard process to reform the obscure EU institutions. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The majority of the economic leaders of the opinion the control of these key competences should be fetched back according to Westminster is asked for their opinion on certain by law controlled topics – of the restrictive trade practices act up to the product legislation. </seg>
<seg id="193"> There was it general dissatisfaction with the home market since meanwhile according to the enterprises the costs of the Brussels rules would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe&apos;s commercial zone – even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises that are traditional at the Europe-friendliest agreed to that. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Finally, and that says presumably the most, our questioning of economic leaders made, that a clear majority change of the agreement is wished from Great Britain a course in the direction and a relationship to the EU that is based on trade not on politics </seg>
<seg id="195"> This discovery which finds itself with the case of enterprises of all sizes and leading company groups shows that the economy is urgent onto a „reasonable change&quot; which brings the notebook of the action again to Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="196"> It is a question of a lot – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead at 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a plebiscite. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The prime minister should not have any doubts: This inquiry shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership </seg>
<seg id="198"> It also shows that the enterprises expect a clear shift of the power relations of some new negotiations back to Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary in increasing measure, after the euro zone moves now in the direction a narrower economic and fiscal agent union. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Jobs and growth must be the priority in Great Britain, as the result of our inquiry it shows which enterprises an increasing attention to trade and a basic change in the Brussels approach for rules means. </seg>

<seg id="399"> Two installations so near with each other: Intention or Gothamite prank? </seg>
<seg id="400"> Gutachs mayor answered this question clearly yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="401"> &quot;The city hall traffic lights were installed then because this safeguards the way to school&quot;, explained Eckert yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="402"> The Kluser traffic lights safeguard both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="403"> The yesterday officially in operation taken installation is important for the crossing field brawn creek way/Kirchstraße. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have the museum, two churches, spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area &gt;Grub&lt;. </seg>

<seg id="411"> The about 15 000 euros expensive traffic lights installation itself is that most &quot;modern, what currently there is on the market&quot;, Arnold explained. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The installation is endowed with colored LEDs which shine so strongly that the lights are to be recognized by the motorists for example also at inferior sun well. </seg>
<seg id="413"> And it is economical also: The older lighting systems use about 100 watts, that new just once eight watts. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Per driving direction there are three lighting systems. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Arnold explained the technique of the new installation This is equipped with two radar sensors. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The pedestrian presses the traffic lights button, tests the upper radar sensor the traffic situation. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The street is free, green comes immediately for the pedestrian, if not, it lasts about 15 seconds. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Another radar sensor checks, whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian. </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;Should a group or gehbehinderte people about the street go, the green phase is prolonged, it comes therefore every secure above the road&quot;, Arnold declared. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Of course the motorist must show initiative here as a partner and observe the road. </seg>
<seg id="421"> This was not yesterday the case: Hardly the traffic lights did not show for pedestrians green, a superclass vehicle roared through - with the case of radiant red. </seg>

<seg id="521"> &quot;This expenditure is now away&quot;, Maier pleases itself. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Halloween 2013: In numbers </seg>
<seg id="523"> When I was small, Halloween had something magic. </seg>
<seg id="524"> My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress ourselves up for the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Today I rather became the Halloween-sourpuss. </seg>
<seg id="526"> In the last two years I did not declare myself readily to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will not do it presumably also this year. </seg>
<seg id="527"> But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns to Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The majority of the Americans - 158 million, in order to be exactly – this year of Halloween celebrate and in total 6.9 billion United States dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations distribute in this case, according to the US American association of the retailers (NRF). </seg>
<seg id="529"> A thing, onto which I me every Halloween then nevertheless again pleases, the trend values are. </seg>
<seg id="530"> The costumes will form about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion of spent United States dollar, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="531"> This year seductive inanimate objects are the last scream. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Women must wrap no more in sexy clothing, they can embody now pizza, hamburger or carrots also seductive food as about instance. </seg>
<seg id="533"> I every amount expect what concerns to men zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bets, the Daft punk space men will get it this year into the Instagram-Feeds. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the meistgesuchten costumes. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I presume, it nothing is turned at tradition. </seg>
<seg id="536"> We covered last year our dogs and were not in this way alone for my astonishment. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In fact Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their domestic animals, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="538"> Those ones are an amount „Hot Dogs&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="539"> We are not what concerns to sweets oversensitive. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollars for that, according to The Nielsen Company. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Those ones are about 270 million kilograms at chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and rubber bears. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Therefore good news for those according to US Board of Trade of Commerce of Commerce 41 million people that pull „Sweet or Acid&quot; through the quarters with the saying. </seg>
<seg id="543"> In fact we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do not show anything to ourselves – eat. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The only thing which we would not like to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless 15 million kilograms of that are sold around Halloween, according to the National association of the sweets manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Those ones are about instance nine billion maize kernels. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It is a puzzle which I could not solve yet. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Nothing belongs anymore to Halloween as houses which it haunts. </seg>
<seg id="548"> You have splendid names as „Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (what after all the way stands in a real prison), „Howl-O-Scream&quot; and „The House of Shock&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="549"> There are in fact 1,200 officially acknowledged spook houses to America Haunts so in the United States that 500 million dollars achieve proceeds, and that includes the wonderful photos on which one pees just into the trousers and that friends put then on Facebook, where one does not rid oneself of it again, and the type onto which one stands leaves a comment to one then as „nice facial expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="550"> But let&apos;s come at last to the pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Charlie Brown machte vertraut us with the Large Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is as the adorning of the Christmas tree – something, that we have done of small on. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Fortunately that one began „Baby in the pumpkin&quot; trend only last year thanks to pint rest, so that most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin, and not, to be in that. </seg>
<seg id="553"> This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, so the US Census office. </seg>
<seg id="554"> The pumpkin lantern which rots slowly in the front garden comes presumably from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested. </seg>
<seg id="555"> If you liked to score correctly, you Tim and Susan Mathisdon call then into Napa, californiums at and you carve something pretty from their 921 kilos heavy pumpkin. </seg>
<seg id="556"> Pimp must into the prison </seg>

<seg id="568"> As a criminal investigation department official told, at least four more cases of exploitive human being trade could be determined according to a first advertisement through telephone monitoring methods. </seg>
<seg id="569"> The conversations listened to were shaped from high aggression. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In later examinations the damaged ones would have confirmed her martyrdom. </seg>
<seg id="571"> A further female witness with whom one of the women had discovered blue spots at the whole body did not do any statement until today. </seg>

<seg id="575"> Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="576"> Against the former minister of the lab-party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales a determination is initiated through the state corruption supervision. </seg>
<seg id="577"> The former NSW-minister denies having changed the regulations for the maritime lease on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid which had covered participations in three plots on from a government viewpoint controlled country. </seg>
<seg id="578"> The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC ­ independent commission against corruption) expanded on Friday their investigations for the question whether Obeid influenced different Ministers of State in such a way to extend leases at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids practiced two restaurants and a café, without announcement after their outgoing in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Now the accusation is investigated, Tripodi knew about Obeids concealed interest at the plots, after Tripodis former deputy stick leader Lynne Ashpole on Thursday had testified corresponding. </seg>
<seg id="580"> In conversations lasting for years which began in 2005 the government had insisted on public announcements for the leases. </seg>
<seg id="581"> On the other hand the tenants were and wanted furthermore longer terms. </seg>
<seg id="582"> In 2009 the leases were extended for the enterprises at the Circular Quay that were the Obeids worth annually 2.5 million dollars without public announcement. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Tripodi, that was of February 2006 until November 2009 harbor minister, had spoken out initially for public announcements. </seg>
<seg id="584"> However, he denied to have made the changes at the request of Obeid who as Tripodi confirmed had insisted on a conversion of the lease regulations of the government. </seg>
<seg id="585"> A telephone record presented to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official that was changed into the harbor ministry that having worked under Obeid in the fishing authority. </seg>
<seg id="586"> „The topic discussed about in these telephone conversations was the preparation of the commercial lease regulations the deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked. </seg>
<seg id="587"> „No&quot;, Tripodi answered. </seg>
<seg id="588"> I cannot remember, which was cured but that was not it definitively. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Definitive not between me and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="590"> NSA-disclosures intensify company paranoia because of state supervision </seg>
<seg id="591"> On a mild day at the end of August a German police helicopter flew deeply over the US consulate in Frankfurt on the Main, the finance capital of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="592"> On the instructions of the federal velvet for intelligence service and terrorism abatement (BVT), the German inside secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US Außenpostens that there is little as 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. </seg>
<seg id="593"> According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the existence of supervision antennae and the action led for an argument into Berlin between the USA and the German foreign ministry of State. </seg>
<seg id="594"> James Clapper, US American Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September once again on the USA not using any possibilities of the foreign espionage „in order to steal the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf of US American companies in this way these their international competitive capacity or their profit could extend.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="595"> However since Edward Snowden, the former employee become to the Whistleblower, began with the publication of his horn of plenty at US American supervision secrets, European governments and enterprise leaders are not more sure, whether they can take the director with the case of the word. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Reports according to which the American National Security Agency ausspioniert the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and got herself for data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo brought the company paranoia onto a new highest level because of state supervision. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The barrel for the overrun brought the disclosure, that chancellor Angela Merkels was a telephone verwanzt, possibly already for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="598"> If the most powerful person can get into the visor in Europe, also managements are potential objectives then with security </seg>
<seg id="599"> Snowden made the intense cooperation between US secret services and enterprises transparent. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I believe, it is conceivable that these data are used to the mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="601"> „Germany must wake up&quot;, declares Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi who represents small and middle IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="602"> German enterprises believe, the USA represented now an almost just as great risk as China did if it is a question of industrial espionage and data theft, such an inquiry that was published by the consultant company EY in July. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In the documents seeped from Snowden it, however, up to now did not give any proof that the USA passed on the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises to own companies. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Politicians expressed their worry over the EU lacking certain IT and internet possibilities and her should reduce their dependence on the USA. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The enterprises are sceptical concerning that. </seg>
<seg id="606"> In the Bundestag Federal Parliament it was suggested we should build up a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I can close only my eyes and open it slowly again... </seg>
<seg id="608"> „So that does not function, Hasso Plattner, chairperson of the German SAP software manufacturer, says. </seg>
<seg id="609"> If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, one should not have made her become extinct 20 years ago then. </seg>
<seg id="610"> All in Germany is subsidized, of the coal above cars up to the agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="611"> All, up to the IT branch. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Nevertheless companies that before had seen the greatest espionage risk in China shocked range and technical smartness of the US espionage authorities uncovered from the Snowden-disclosures. </seg>
<seg id="613"> With the Cloud Computing a great change occurs because European enterprise conductors are now more conscious that in the USA stored data of the nonlocal jurisdiction are defeated and therefore potentially endangered are. </seg>
<seg id="614"> According to an inquiry carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected after the disclosures about the US American data Mining activities with Prism for instance ten percent the not in the USA resident members plans, to be useful an American provider. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Jim Snabe, deputy manager of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customers that a year ago there was not yet – it says: Where my data are stored and you can guarantee that these stay physically in this right room </seg>
<seg id="616"> Many German enterprise conductors represent the opinion the recent reports only simply confirm that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore these must be guarded at all costs what they in any case already knew indeed. </seg>
<seg id="617"> That industrial espionage occurs is not a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="618"> That was always like this. </seg>
<seg id="619"> „A topic was for many years and did not change itself through the current discussion in a basic way&quot;, says Kurt Bock, chairperson of the chemistry enterprise BASF. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The Americans spy us on commercial and industrial level, so as we that also do, because it is in the national interest to defend our enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="621"> The management does not boast usually about the countermeasures that one took, because with that provides assailants advantages. </seg>
<seg id="622"> In great enterprises employees are already long blued to, that the taking along of a free USB-Sticks on a fair or the unattended forgetting of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, putting it mildly. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Collecting the mobiles so that they cannot be used as monitors says to Ulrich Hackenberk, board member near car manufacturer Audi, that it belongs to the standard practice for years before an executive board meeting. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The German BVT recommends managers to use simple Prepaid-mobiles if they go onto trips abroad because smartphones can be possibly compromised. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The Prepaid-mobiles are thrown away afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="626"> The worry withstands it, however, that small and middle enterprises remain Hacking and supervision vulnerably opposite. </seg>
<seg id="627"> In Germany many of these enterprises are worldwide market leaders in the respective niche. </seg>
<seg id="628"> „Small and middle enterprises often miss the experience, the personnel and the financial resources in order to protect companies confidential secrets effectively against not authorized access the BVT warns in a report. </seg>
<seg id="629"> The USA warn own companies against industrial espionage through other countries. </seg>
<seg id="630"> According to Washington mail office France, Russia and Israel were classified in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February behind China on rank two of the countries which used the Hackings for the procurement of economic data. </seg>
<seg id="631"> A board member of a German Blue-chip-enterprise agreed if it is a question of industrial espionage, then „the French are the worst&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Bernard Squarcini, former conductor of the French inside secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with following words: „The secret services know very exactly that all countries ausspionieren their allies even if they cooperate in the fight against the terror.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="978"> Scientists could fling more light on in which connection the tail wag of a dog with his atmosphere stands </seg>
<seg id="979"> Former investigations had shown that happy dogs waved more to the right with the tail (from view of the dog) while it was being the left page at nervous dogs. </seg>
<seg id="980"> However, now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to that. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a Neurowissenschaftler of the Trient university, said: „With the human being is well known, that the left and react right hemisphere differently on Stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here we attempted to notice this about us with the case of other species. </seg>
<seg id="983"> He in addition noticed, that at dogs as with the human being the right hemisphere is responsible exactly for the movement of the left page and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles with the case of the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> In order to find out more about that, reacting to the lateral tail wag of their fellows, the researchers controlled the animals, as dog while these films of other dogs were looking at themselves. </seg>
<seg id="985"> You measured the heart frequency of the Vierbeiner and analyzed the behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Probably we will soon understand, why the tail once into one, once in motion into the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vallortigara said: „We showed films with dogs to the dogs – either a nature-true version or a silhouette, in order to eliminate other aspects turning away, and we could control in this way more towards to the left or to the right the movement of the tail.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="988"> If the animals saw, how one otherwise blank dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely loose </seg>
<seg id="989"> The tail inclination was, however, above all to the left (again from perspective of the dog that waves), so their heart frequency increased and they looked restless. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the view of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate on purpose with each other through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> It is rather convinced, that the dogs would have learned from experience, at which movements they should do themselves to worries and when not. </seg>
<seg id="992"> He said: „If one has different meetings with other dogs and the wag is linked with the tail into a direction rather with friendly behavior and produces the right page rather one less friendly behavior, then one reacts to basis of these experiences.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to a better sense of the emotions of their animal. </seg>
<seg id="994"> John Bradshaw, Experte for dog behaviors and guest scholarship holder at the department of animal medicine of the university of Bristol declared this was not the first study at the was examined, whether to the left and to the right important for dogs is. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year a team of the university found out that dogs turn the head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog from Lincoln and to the right, if it is a question of a satisfied dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In another study work at the university of Victoria in Canada following stood „Dogs rather go towards a robot dog, if his ,Schwanz‘ waves to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study. </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to his statement the differences could originate therefore from the dogs not interpreting as dogs the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs in the different studies. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study, to react to real dogs as dogs, could help, it declared. </seg>
<seg id="999"> „Indeed it gives considerable proofs of many different mammals that the two hemispheres are used for different purposes, nevertheless many of the details must still be determined – and dogs do not form any exception there&quot;, so Bradshaw&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Since their behavior, however, can simply be recorded, it will long presumably not last until we understand why the tail sometimes into one, sometimes in motion into the other direction. </seg>

<seg id="1052"> „My husband and I bought just a house, there my whole money is „in that&quot;, Amirthalinga says. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Although they every month 3,000 Singapore dollars (ca 1,730 euros) than administration employee deserves and their husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, it explains. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> In fact the demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the budgets increases – that ValueMax, where she carried out their exchange, became the third pawnshop to be listed at the Singaporean stock exchange this week. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> The pawning of jewelry is not only a fast way in order to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsaved bank loan. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> Typically pawnshops require in Singapore an effective year interest of 17 percent that lies only just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas demands Bank a local credit grantor with a branch in the same shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> Pawnshops offer, however, the advantage that no inspection of the creditworthiness or income proofs are necessary here, for which loans are more fast than possible near banks </seg>
<seg id="1058"> For this reason millions of people turn in the region to pawnshops after families sense the pressure through increasing costs of living as well as an increasing budget and consumer indebtedness. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed markets families with smaller and middle incomes consult pawnshops in order to balance so the difference with the case of stuttering economy. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> This week the rating agency described standard &amp; Poor&apos;s wachsende budget indebtedness, main through increasing mortgages, as a factor of risk for the creditworthiness of Asiatic banks </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have according to assessment of the agency the highest budget indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Malaysia stands with 80 percent of the BIP at the top of the list, a rise of 60 percent still in the year 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Nation business persons worry also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week just from a technical recession. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> On Thursday the data showed an export weakness keeping on existing and a remission of the consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> „In the final effect that means, that faced with increasing costs the people in the middle one will attempt to lower segment (the income scale), their to complement&quot; „incomes where that is always possible,&quot; says song Seng Wun, economist, at CIMB, a Malaysian bank </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Historical highest levels with the case of the gold prices of gold in the last two years still intensified the trend towards the pledge of personal objects since the people take the opportunity for changing the jewelry of the family into cash. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned objects are gold in the 200 pawnshops of the city state. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> The people tell: „The gold price of gold looks good, let us grandmother&apos;s Goldkette pawn and fetch back next month.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1069"> The tallest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20 per cent customer increase in his branches in the last months. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The growth in the pledge business is so strong, that ValueMax would like to expand, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only into the adjacent Malaysia – where the enterprise practices four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, manageress of ValueMax. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> The enterprise finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore-dollars which it took this week with the initial public offering in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> While some credit grantors were getting into the cross fire because of high interest rates, Yeah declares that pawnshops would not offer only more favorable interests than other lenders, but did not increase the debts directly either. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> „Customers grant a loan on objects which they already own and the liquefaction of personal articles of value does not extend the Haushaltsverschulung&quot;, it explains. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> The pawnbroking business is accepted socially increasingly as a short-term, protected financing. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Also all people are not, use the pawnbroking, in financial difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of ValueMax in order to pawn gold bars and Rolex-clocks for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price cash. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> To us customers come from every social shift </seg>
<seg id="1078"> „Prosperous ones who lend something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises which must bridge bottlenecks in the Cash Flow belong to that&quot;, says Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Sometimes they also simply need money only very much quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> Rangnick-Schelte for ski resistance: Mane no swallow king </seg>
<seg id="1081"> So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current top form of Federal League Tabellenführer Red Bull Salzburg also is, so disappointed the sport director of the &quot;bulls&quot; of the referees showed himself. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan into the category are pushed swallow kings&quot;, he defended the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday on a press conference in Salzburg. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Recent reason for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday at which an alleged acting for the doom became to the Senegalese - that certainly was not a how the TV pictures showed. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> &quot;A blatant incorrect decision&quot;, meant Rangnick, the referee Harkam as &quot;completely overtaxed&quot; described. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Harkam would have contributed furthermore &quot;his part&quot; to the escalation between Salzburg-coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-coach Adi Hütter to the lot. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> He defended his German compatriot dezidiert: &quot;There I would have behaved in every single situation now as Roger Schmidt&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Schmidt himself does not want to have had after the Scharmützel with Hütter any contact with his colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> I would not know, why. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> &quot;Because I am that one that was offended&quot;, stressed the 46-year long one. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> Faced with the success race Rangnick sang, however, a praise hymn. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> &quot;For that there are only two words: Correctly well&quot;, he stated. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Misfiring a lot does not give. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> Particularly the kind and way in which the team plays is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> That is supposed to go on quietly so. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> There will hardly be cadre changes in the winter transfer time. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> There are not any splendid reasons to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> &quot;Except for a player confronts with the wish, that he wants to leave the association&quot;, Rangnick explained. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> A study which is supposed to increase the advantages of the HS2 railroad project for Scotland was announced by the British government. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> In the work of HS2 Ltd it is suggested to realize already with beginning of phase 1 per year 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Traffic minister Baroness Kramer said, the project will bring together Great Britain nearer. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> The Scotch Minister of Transport Keith Brown declared it is very delighted with the British government at this plan to work. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Phase 1 consists of a new high speed railroad connection between London and the west Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> On completion of phase 2 there will be according to connections Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> In June the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high speed trasses between London and north England of 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The British government which stands in conversations with transportation Scotland charged HS2 Ltd to search for further stretch capacities and travel time improvements for north England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> The possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or little belongs to that from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Baron&apos;s daughter Kramer said: „Our objective for HS2 is a really national railway network, the Great Britain and his cities nearer brings together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1108"> We precede with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages with themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our traction network. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> However it is a question also of the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, that is improved thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The Scotch undersecretary Alistair Carmichael commented: „The present announcement is a good information for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1112"> On behalf of the Scotch government Keith Brown Carmichael asked to support the Scotch integration „unmistakably&quot; into the HS2-network. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> Brown said: „The high speed railroad connection contains the potential of enormous economical advantages for Scotland, simultaneously also the economic strength of Scotland supplies, however, an argument for fast railroad connections in whole Great Britain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Therefore we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high speed railroad connection in Scotland that creates advantages for all and the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh complements that the Scotch government already plans. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> I look forward to examining the research report with the British ministers in the next year and deciding on the next steps together. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Living with future perspective </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Actually Waltraud Ries lives marvellously. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Your house lies in one quiet residential area&apos;s of Stuttgart with a lot green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and neither too much traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Into the city it is only few minutes with public means of transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> &quot;You are not afraid it is to be hoped of spiders&quot;? Waltraud Ries asks and points at a fat spider at the door frame. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> I search already for some time a new apartment for my husband and me. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the worry, it declares not to be able to overcome the many stairs anymore in the age to the house and in the apartment. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Furthermore: For a meniscus-operation the Mittfünfzigerin has had to find out at the own body what means to move from storey with Handicap to storey. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Recently first a book was published from it on the topic &apos;Live happily in the age - Which Living-Form the best is for me?&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> &apos;Our apartment is the best example of what&apos; does not &apos;work&apos; in the age at all begins to tell it </seg>
<seg id="1127"> When it more than 20 years ago with their husband moved into the May sonnet apartment, it was only simple a beautiful apartment right in the Green Party member </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Today with middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks different about that. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> She also knows, however, that she belongs to the few people who deal with the topic &apos;Live in the age&apos; anyway. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Most replace it as long as it works. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Only the others get old always&apos;, she says smiling. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Only if the suffering pressure is really big one is concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &apos;Then it&apos; can &apos;be&apos;, however&apos;, already too late&apos;, according to Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In their book the interior designer presents 17 living-models for an even specific living in the age. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> &apos;Which living-form one, however, chooses is always an Individualentscheidung&apos;, it declares. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> There is not D i e solution for the age. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Even who can afford the age transition fit in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can become also sick. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> And: &apos;Without good knowledge of the national language vereinsame one also in the Dolce Vita&apos;, the specialized book book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Under their models classical care models, alternative living-forms or the often quoted Rentner-WG, are found. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In the age everyone has so his tics and flaws </seg>
<seg id="1141"> &apos;For me such a flat-sharing community would not be, however, anything&apos; she thinks with a wink. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Already not at all as in a Studenten-WG with a common bath and a kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> &apos;In the age one simply needs also his withdrawal rooms&apos;, according to Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> That nevertheless a senior flat-sharing community can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> That must go by then differently, however, than in the classical Studenten-WG. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> And sometimes one simply wants also only his rest&apos;, she believes. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> With this opinion it does not stand at least in the capital only there. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay &apos;as long as it works in their own apartment&apos;, also the experience of Theresa Rütten is, the head of the civil service life in the age of the capital. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Your office advises people around the topic &apos;Get older&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Therefore older people would just accept also inconveniences and restrictions frequently only in order to be able to stay in their usual surroundings that is also the experience of the foundation product test. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> In this case there are today many possibilities to design the house or the apartment barrier-freely. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Ream is recommended to all that deal with the age-just reconstruction of their house or their apartment first once thoroughly to inform and not to charge the first-best craftsman. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Today there are specialists also for the age-just reconstruction. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Even in the flat let for rent one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But not always the existing apartment is let age-raked and reshape in this way barrier-freely even if it is still so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> This experience had to make Waltraud Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Indeed one could install a stairs lift within the apartment, the way paved also with stairs to to the apartment door would be, however, the by far greater obstacle. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It will weitersuchen until she found the ideal object for itself and their husband. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> She is terrified by the move more by it than by the spider at their apartment door. </seg>

<seg id="1185"> Cocaine-Dependent Attorney, the drug boss in front of police determination warned, must into the prison </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The attorney was afraid, his secret drug addiction could come onto the light </seg>
<seg id="1188"> He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court to three years of prison </seg>
<seg id="1189"> A known punishment defender that warned a drug baron against a great police determination because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, three years of custody was condemned to. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations to his activities in the drug traffic after he had been compromised by his own cocainism. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The attorney considered as „first-class&quot; by criminalists with the nickname „Bash&quot; was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police had controlled Scarborough which he had represented in a former drug procedure. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Officials observed, as Scarborough (32) three bags cocaine at the house of the attorney in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered, while this with colleagues was being to the Bar Association during a food. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The investigations revealed, that Ditta consumed regular drugs of the class A, after in the case of tests tracks of cocaine in his hairs, on his wallet and at credit cards had been found. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Over a period of eight months between January and he attempted August 2011, without authorization information about the arrest of two men in the task of Scarborough and one of his partners to get. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> All four suspects were controlled then by the police within the framework of a great preliminary inquiry for the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and west Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Together with 32 other persons they were arrested later after the police guaranteed heroin and cocaine to the value of 1.5 million pounds as well as 200,000 pounds at cash with the case of a series of house searches. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction can become public. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Today Ditta became that for the office Forbes Solicitors works in Blackburn, been at the Liverpooler Crown Court according to a three week long procedure in two charges because of hindrance of the justice for guilty and condemned. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> He admitted with the case of a former questioning the cocaine possession </seg>
<seg id="1200"> The attorney was transferred after the police found out at their investigations against Scarborough that this had stood in February 2011 in regular telephonic contact with Ditta. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Two investigation officials followed the suspect and saw how it went to Dittas house and laid the drugs with a purity of 60 percent there under the garbage can of the attorney in a black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In a word after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough phoned regularly Ditta who was during the supper in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The attorney returned home, got the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In court court it became known that Ditta was a „regular consumer&quot; of cocaine after with the case of tests drugs of the class A in his hairs, his wallet and on his credit cards had been discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Ditta was arrested later, denied, however, to take cocaine and said it spoke with the supposed dealer, because this his mandator is, and said their discussion is subjected to the „attorney secret&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and attempted to remove a row from credit cards, nevertheless they were guaranteed and a hair test was taken from it </seg>
<seg id="1207"> During the police interrogation he served, he practices an office both under his private address and at the job and mandators would call him at home because of juridical matters. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> In court court it became known that he had called and informed important protagonists of the drug traffic from whom he had represented some before after important arrests of what the observers about them knew. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> State attorney Anne Whyte said: „A criminal law law attorney should know better that one does not break the law than all others should.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Ditta is accused of the abuse of his position as a punishment defender since he went along with certain mandators too very much. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The relationship in question is simply not that of a drug trader, but a drug trader&apos;s that supplies his attorney with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> A part of his communications was beyond doubt legitimate, because he was the attorney of these persons. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> However, that exceeded far the borders of a normal relationship between attorney and mandator. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> It counteracted the police investigations so far as possibly so that they kept on being able to follow their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> It suited certain mandators too near, in particular Scarborough, and it permitted that his independence was compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> Ditta expelled every error behavior from himself and claimed: „If I was a corrupt attorney, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait then any 15 hours, but would do that immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1218"> However after the hearing superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: „Herr Ditta added the step to a criminal from a punishment defender in the moment when he started acquiring drugs of organized criminals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1219"> His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless Kompromittierung and did it pronely to the motives of leading members of the organized criminality that charged him to obtain valuable information about police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> Attorneys must maintain the highest standards at integrity and guarantee in public for confidence and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> Ditta cheated this confidence and attempted to entrench oneself behind the facade of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta that led also to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession from cocaine and justice hindrance, which underlines our determination to bring criminals in court court. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> This case should be criminals a warning and it shows that no one can escape from the arm of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> We find you and bring you in court court. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Prison was condemned to Scarborough itself to 14 years after it had declared itself to the conspiracy for the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade for guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Thirty-five more at the drug traffic beteiligte&apos;Personen were condemned to total punishments of 153 years because of drug offenses. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> On his web site Ditta published a field with questions and answers above themselves in which he served, it is his dream job to represent as an attorney mandator in the death cell in America, his ultimativer guest during the supper is Mohammed Ali and chance inequality is the motivation for his work </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Up to the present time the police inspection Kempten can look back upon a quiet Halloween-night. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The officials were called to children egg-flinging only twice too that flung these against house facades. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Since the houseowners recognized this in time and the ones remote like Eierreste, also no property damage might have arisen. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Furthermore also some Sylvesterböller were presumably ignited in the town area, but also here no property damage arose. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg announced, that his Pkw with loo paper wrapped and were stolen his wheel facing strips. </seg>

<seg id="1251"> If the municipalities agree to the structural alteration measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, railways and Federal Government divide themselves the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the Bahübergangs &quot;Am deer&quot; to the district council. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There the city plans, in to build height of the nonlocal tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a deflection. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> There can also bigger vehicles, for example such that transport long-cut wood with the case of oncoming traffic traffic stand without having to block the rails </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Grießhaber suggested therefore to construct a necessary retaining wall so. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This was discussed in the district council controversially since some councils questioned the necessity of a street circulation: Thomas Kipp brought the atmosphere of the critics with his comment onto the point: &quot;We must take so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The level crossing &quot;deer&quot; is used regularly for long-cut wood transportations. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even wood from the field &quot;cow creek is transported in part over this stretch because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the stretch at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In addition the stretch is used as Umleitungfür the vehicles that must not use the tunnel if the main road is spaced, argued Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg- and castle mountain tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated as this is currently the case in Wolfach, &quot;Am &quot;deer&quot; also for a longer period can be to the level crossing &quot;of an important traffic importance </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The councils agreed on making examine which costs the thought broadening of the street would cause. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Despite that was agreed the reconstruction of the level crossing mainly with the possible specification, that the necessary retaining wall is built so that the city can extend the subsequent street where appropriate direction &quot;Railway station trasses&quot; for meeting traffic on about 5.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> On the other hand the reconstruction of the level crossing near the tannery familiar wine could involve a very different problem which affects the access into the &quot;Geroltzhäuser Weg&quot; going up strongly. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The administration had made examine the reconstruction plans of the railways of the engineering office Breinlinger since she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser way is still possible without further one. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation came for the result, that it is not to be excluded that the inclination relations of the street could result in longer vehicles sitting up. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The responsibility for that supports in turn the city as a road construction load carrier. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The reconstruction can involve accordingly liability quarrels. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Since both the wood removal and the turning in the current capacity stage functioned, one is not supposed to agree to the reconstruction of the level crossing, argued Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is clearly smaller at this place than at the other level crossings because the breakpoint middle to which a good line of sight connection exists is directly next to that. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Even trains of the central station would have to be here at this place already so far slowed down that no collision threatens. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Mainly the approval was refused the reconstruction of this level crossing since the city of Schiltach &quot;would have to pay&quot; for the problem with vehicles sitting up, according to the councils since the railways can withdraw from the responsibility on completion of the construction works. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The committee considers the reconstructions as unproblematic at the level crossings &quot;Before hay creek and &quot;Before cow creek for which already crossing agreements with the railways were reached. </seg>

<seg id="1431"> „According to opinion of the prosecution Coulson that now Herausgeber is the NotW is not to catch anybody that stands before the apartment of people and hopes it on fresh action but one, the people&apos;s confronted with a history gladly in order to see their reaction&quot; declared Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> He said NotW uses three procedures in order to investigate histories investigativ: Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The editor is participated in the third method personally. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Obviously he knows about the second, the supervision, it cannot be different. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> How does it look with the first? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> He knows above the Telefon-Hacking Bescheid? </seg>
<seg id="1437"> He denies that, but we say: „And whether he knew about that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Rumors about an affair Clarkes were picked up first by the feature editorial staff from NotW when a source that was sexually interested at Pawlby was said to: „You&quot; do not „waste your time, she is with Charles together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A volume with voice mail of their telephone of at least three reasons apartment was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> The observers in addition found entries on the computer of the detective on whom Pawlby and their sister as „projects&quot; were stored. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> In the time, when the investigations ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, declared Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the supervision of the movements of Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On 18th June 2005 Coulson left a voice mail with following contents to her: „I have a story which we want to bring out tomorrow which I would like to talk about gladly with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1444"> Edis declared about instance the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett Coulsons activities with the case of this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett confronted because of an affair with a married woman that had been then married when it was associated even with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Coulson and Brooks deny to have oneself with others verschworen between the 3rd October 2000 and the 9th August 2006 telephones chop. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: Being arisen more quickly </seg>
<seg id="1449"> Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries as investigations show. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical changes do not mean the puberty immediately yet </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is not any proof of hormones or other chemicals being responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe, the epidemic corpulence is a trigger of the early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend towards the early puberty is less marked with boys </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is one journalist, that specialized on child health and family topics. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Should a mother be worried if from seven or eight years breasts and shame hairs increase to their daughter already in the age? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Declared during the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics child specialist association this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm </seg>
<seg id="1457"> „I spend a lot of time with calming parents – usually is that no sign for the puberty setting in now quickly&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Obvious advertisements of the development as for example wachsende breasts, shame and armpit hairs as well as body odor, are proved with girls formerly. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> Nevertheless it gave only a slight shift with the case of the age of the Menarche (Appearance of the first rule bleeding in the last 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States the average age at 12.5 years, a little little, lies as 12.75 in the year 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> „If the development of the breasts begins, it lasts still at least two to three years up to the Menarche&quot;, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book „Morning puberty with girls: The essential mentor for the contact with this problem occurring frequently&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> During the most exact test is, as the puberty strides. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is controversial what in fact represents the beginning of the puberty, nevertheless it is valid „precociously&quot; if the breast enlargement is accompanied from a growth push before an age of eight years. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases the process slows itself down or stagnates – something, that a child specialist can control exactly. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In the case of faster striding tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems as tumors or cysts can be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatment methods to the delaying of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: to the early aging of the bones that can lead ultimativ to growth inhibition and in this way small body growth with adults. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a medikamentöse or hormonal therapy base themselves on the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz what concerns, but grants medicines is reserved: „The suppression of the puberty can moderate behavior problems to be different than their contemporaries and the feelings of girls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other great problem is understandable: Parents would simply not like, that their very young daughters have the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> „You worry because of the pregnancy risk or about that as they handle the hygienic page said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> „A shock was&quot;, a woman whose daughter got their days with ten remembers. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> It came verängstigt and annoyed by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> However, there are not any conclusive proofs of hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media being causal. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Boys come similar to girls into the puberty formerly. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz thinks the most convincing premise is the epidemic of the corpulence. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> It supported the realization of a study in the age of six to nine years that makes a connection between body fat and the entry into the puberty per year in 2001 above girls. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors which played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are for that different declarations </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Globally an early puberty seems from all possible things to be influenced, of economic conditions about the climate up to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A further puzzle: Although the face and shame hairiness increases to boys already formerly, the trend towards a vollumfänglichen former puberty is not as marked as with girls. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other doctors on the AAP-conference underlined the complexity of the topic. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The emergence of acne and shame hair is spread even with babies and small children. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> „We must be cautious as we identify the true beginning of the puberty&quot;, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe, at the Goryeb Children&apos;s hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Parents should not hesitate with making oneself from their child specialist be advised as they should speak with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> „That can mean, that one formerly than expected a conversation must lead, Kaplowitz guessed. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If one remains quiet the child reacts usually well. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Girls that early blossom need the insurance, that the process is a normal part of the life, self when it formerly than thought kicks in. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Illmensee: Second Mountainbike-race inspires participants </seg>
<seg id="1493"> In the case of marvellous weather 214 cyclists came according to Illmensee in order to overcome the cylindrical course about the hill chains around the lake. </seg>

<seg id="1504"> Also the age structure reached from ten years at the youngest ones up to more than 70 years with the oldest starters. </seg>

<seg id="1507"> Under that Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike half pro of the Black-Tusk-Racing team. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Pangerl was a world champion together with a team colleague already two times in the twelve-hour-driving. </seg>

<seg id="1524"> Borussia Dortmund announced then hard consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Before the Friday game of the soccer Federal League against the VfB Stuttgart the Ultras with a silence reacted - at first. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> A new, almost already spooky acoustics was, that the observer to shortly before the starting whistle of the Federal League game between the German vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park offered. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> The guest fans with their songs were mainly to be heard. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The south bleacher against where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB-fans stand was presented at first unusually quietly No songs, no battle calls. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> The platform of the Capo which otherwise coordinates the common Anfeuerung remained vacant. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> And very in front on the bleacher a big flag with label &quot;Section stadium prohibition waved in an alone way. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Only as a goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller as always as a first BVB player the place entered, short-term rejoicing surged on. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> When his team colleagues followed, there were loud song and waving scarves - however for a long time not everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south bleacher nothing moved. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel counted the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory above arsenal, contract prolongation of coach Jürgen Klopp - once again, did not guarantee for celebration mood. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Only five minutes in front of the starting whistle the Capo climbed up his platform - and the until then almost with hands tangible strain unloaded in a loud scream, than Dickel as usual asked the atmosphere on the ranks in the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> It was up as last as always to the south bleacher - and the loudest place was final here again as usual in the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> And at the latest than with starting whistle of the south bleacher the loud request &quot;suits Derby winner on&quot; came, everything was again as always. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The silence before was presumably a reaction to the events of the last days. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> Immediately before district derby near the FC some of the traveled BVB supporters signal rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the place had fired hatch batten 04 - and hit in this case almost goalkeepers novel Weidenfeller. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The game was started because of the chaotic scenes in a late way. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had obtained the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras then in his office - and one believes Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> &quot;There will be for the entire ultramovement massive incisions&quot;, announced the BVB-boss at the Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> As a Sofortmaßnahme Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home match against the VfB Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> &quot;I forbade that&quot;, it declared. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> We cannot give up the zero-tolerance-politics as regards pyrotechny. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Furthermore different possibilities of a penalization were shown to the Ultras - up to the Tuesday have decided these now time for one. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will define a sanction until end of the coming week. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> &quot;That becomes drastic&quot;, assured Watzke. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> One may be tense as the reactions turn out on the south bleacher then. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> What happens on the way with my E-Mail? </seg>
<seg id="1551"> E-mail is called really actually electronic letter. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Was the letter secret transformed with the case of the draft of the internet-service similar to E-Mail as at the traditional mail office technically? </seg>
<seg id="1553"> During the conception of the early internet services stood to the fore, to make communication possible. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Therefore one did not pay attention at the basic technical protocols to creating a stable foundation for an anhörsicheren correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Therefore a traditional E-Mail rather corresponds to an open postcard as a sealed letter. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> If user &quot;Anna&quot; sends a mail to &quot;Benni&quot;, the computers of the two of them are then directly joined? </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step to the mail server of their Service-Providers. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> If she has for example a GMail-account, the Google would be. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> This mail-server sends the contents to the Provider which Benni uses. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> On the stretch the mail can run across many other servers in the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Bennie can phone his Provider then the contents. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Are traditional E-Mails read on their way by the net? </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Most mails are read on the way repeatedly by software-robots. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> At the Provider of the sender it is checked normally whether the mail leads a pitiful program as an appendix with themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> On the receiver-systems also a virus-check is planned. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> In addition the Provider check whether it is a question of an annoying and unwanted spam mail the now putly or at least into a spam folder is way-sorted. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Do the robots have another further task? </seg>
<seg id="1568"> With the case of systems as GMail the robot determines also the information which Google needs for the placing of context-advertising </seg>
<seg id="1569"> When Anna and Benni by GMail communicate over their coming holiday trip, can insert links corresponding to Google to vacation offers. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Do also unknown people read the E-Mails with? </seg>
<seg id="1571"> The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail, is extremely small. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> That is theoretical, however, possible. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> In companies administrators have frequently the possibility to read electronic mail office. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> Also the prosecution authorities and secret services caught legal possibilities, E-Mails or to take note. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> For this purpose possible illegal spying actions come. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Is it possible to protect E-Mails against the monitor? </seg>
<seg id="1577"> With an encoding according to the OpenPGP-standard an E-Mail can be enciphered effectively against monitors. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> With high technical expenditure it is also possible to disguise the metadatas of an e-mail communication so that not even without further be recognized can who with whom has communicated. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail-market in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Near the mainly privately used post-office boxes Yahoo and Google according to an investigation of Convios only play consulting from August 2013 a subordinate role. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> While the parts had been falling last from Yahoo-mail, GMail of Google could hot up the pace clearly. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Germany&apos;s biggest national church has an Offensivegestartet in order to advertise the profession of the pastor. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Background is a possible priest lack: The evangelic Hanover national church reckons that the number of their currently about 1,800 woman ministers and pastors according to present situation to 2030 will halve itself. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the conversation with the Evangelic News Service. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> With Burfien the national church charged for the first time a pastor to inspire young people for the theology study on a full place. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> At the time of decide always less young people after the school-leaving examination, to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Burfien puts this down to the process of the Entkirchlichung: &quot;Gottes Stimme is quiet the world is loud&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> In this case the profession is shaped from great freedom and variety. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> I am a gentleman of my diary and can put my emphases, where it is important to me, there. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Pastors could be very near as ministers with the people. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> You deserved so much as teachers and could live well on that. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for that theologians would have a secure employer. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> That complies with the young people for whom it is a question not only of career, but of a sense-fulfilled work from today. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> According to information of the national church which contains three quarters of Lower Saxony about currently per annum 60 pastors retire. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Simultaneously about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their curacy. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In sparsely populated fringe ranges as the resin, the Emsland or the turning-country it can become in the future heavy to fill places. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Burfien wants to organize among other things study days for young people and invite also prominent persons to that, have studied the theology. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> The theology study offers a wide training. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> One can become in this way even Federal President. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Hearing in front of the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees in front of accusations accused of Sexualdelikten against Jonathan Lord </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Two YMCA-employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of Sexualdelikten in connection with children before 2011 reproaches were raised against the child nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah as the Royal commission heard from children for sexual abuse </seg>
<seg id="1603"> However with the case of the opening declaration in front of the commission the YMCA had declared one had never had to put in the organization from sexual child abuse with an incident. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Manager Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of offenses with child pornography and another, at which a sport teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 because of the abuse had been condemned it children&apos;s entrusted with. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Hare said to Gail Furness, an attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, did not know the second, however. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He added the opening declaration of the YMCA opposite the commission was also inaccurate in the claim „there were external inspections of the YMCA, in which the YMCA than at most front front with the case of the child security was acknowledged </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Proofs in front of the commission rather show that the YMCA was informed about that. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare that began with 21 at the YMCA granted, the management failed „from me&quot; of Lord „downwards&quot; during the attitude and not guaranteed that employees realized their obligations to be reported violations of the guidelines for the child security </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Lord had been condemned at the beginning of the year because of Sexualvergehen at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> He was condemned to at least six years of prison. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem which kept employees from that to announce lords violations with respect to the security of children. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The employees stated they would have observed violations among other things, that Lord was alone with children, was in charge of it privately as sitters, made her be on his lap it told with regard to one that he has it dearly, and made play children with his mobile. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Danielle Ockwell testified, that superior Lord was and that had asked for a training to the child protection because it was gotten because of his behavior, that the child service head Jacqui Barnat that in the YMCA Caringbah the superior was to lords „very intimidating and most time was very unapproachable&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The manager declared their superiors it would not accept statements of employees according to which these would not have dared announcement refund. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Instead of this, so he said, their friendship with lord rather influenced their discernment, for which they would not have announced it </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Hare declared it informed the executive board of the YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson that has to draw the organization from the „Jonathan lord incident not the reporting&quot; through employees affects, and the executive board agreed to it </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Hare said the decision to push the employees from secrecy obligations for the signature shortly after appearance of the accusations was made by the manager of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He said a Kontaminierung of the proofs should be prevented in this way, which, however, „übereifrig&quot; and badly was transplanted. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The YMCA NSW was not an organization secure for children in the time, when Jonathan lord was there busy in between 2009 and 2011, declared professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, expert for sexual child abuse the commission. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> It explained that there were „serious problems&quot; during the attitude inspection, training, training and supervision of the employees. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The hearing was adjourned until 20th December. </seg>

<seg id="1623"> On about 120 meters length is below Cologne a sewer from the Roman time keep. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Who goes to Cologne does not pass by the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> About 157 meters jut out the two towers into the sky and turn it into the second-highest church building of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Nevertheless only few visitors who gaze at the two filigree church towers foresee that discovering an amount gives also under the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Rainer Schulze is an expert as regards underworld of Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> The service-center of Cologne-tourism is meeting place for his leaderships directly at the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The round begins very unspectacularly: &quot;We begin in the basement garage&quot;, Schulze says. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the seventies the city fathers wanted an selfjust city, and therefore only that kept on standing from the residues of the old city wall, which was not too large. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most users of the multi-storey car park hurry therefore past today also at the roman remains and park only their car. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> However, who in a more exact way hinschaut, discovered in the parking deck D2 an archeological place of finding separated by metal railings. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> About five meters of high ruins are to be seen of palm of the hand big stones. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;There are residues of the roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century according to Christ&quot;, tells Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before it goes again back onto the daylight, Schulze makes the participants on the upper park level fling another look into a shaft dark, 15 meters deep. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> That is the well of the old cathedral which is also hardly perceived unfortunately. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> The Prätorium is next station of the round, and here the participants climb again down into the depth. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> We experience the seat of the once most powerful man here north of the alps, the pregate of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> A visitor would like to know what means CCAA. </seg>

<seg id="1647"> The Jewish municipality built their bath deeply into the ground in order to come onto the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual ablutions. </seg>

<seg id="1654"> Declared to Drew Bowler, manager of Bowler motor sport „The Rally-customers who come to Bowler changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1655"> You are not race drivers experienced all, but people, which are in search of tension and adventure as well as to an accessible way to world class events. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We are pleased with being able to reveal Rover and the MSA this way in partnership with country and believe of that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different Rally-disciplines in Great Britain and the exterior country and to prepare newcomers for the strains and the reality of Rally Raid. </seg>

<seg id="1659"> George Kerevan: The choice gives the Scots European deconcentration </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new terror history for the independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time we are warned against an independent Scotland being necessary in order to join the Schengen-room as a condition for the EU membership </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That supplies the keyword for histories about passport checks into Berwick and a border safeguarded with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> In fact the possible economical advantages which more travel freedom would bring in the remaining Europe with themselves were referred in the Strathclyde-presentation nevertheless this did not play any role – as expected – in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend their strict rules to themselves frequently if it is more favorable to them. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Since Scotland does currently not belong to the Schengen-room the consecutive nonobservance would be only a small concession for Brussels in the corresponding train for what one really wants from the bulkheads. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Therefore actually no story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And one, the already so in the years has come, that it resembles already a fossil: The first time I meant the „independence passport check&quot; duck at least 40 years ago belongs. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In this case an interesting point disappears during the constant repetition of this ancient history </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances to the European whistle </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Those ones are the real European news: The plan great, understood after the war to the union of Europe came to a standstill. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Everywhere in the EU parties at ground win which are EU enemy or would like to fling the euro overboard as community currency. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative could get just five million voices for Germany – set up only this year – during the Bundestag Federal Parliament choice in September for themselves and drive out in this way the Free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) effectively of the Bundestag Federal Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There was always domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalistic Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The current depression turns out, however, as a turning point point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the severe saving-politics imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by the adherence at the common currency many people think, the project Europe went too far. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Little has to do the crisis of the euro with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead of this the euro system tied down his members to exchange rates that are useful for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that so gladly. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency Southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage opposite Germany recovers itself. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The only possibility consists in abbreviating wages and public editions – encouraged by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Behind the current budget and currency problems a deep lies going European productivity problem. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a consequence of the „green&quot; energy guidelines prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy enterprises at the expense of the consumers – the European industry pays compared with the United States the Double for electricity and the fourfold thing for gas. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> That is a paralyzing cost disadvantage how we could already look into Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All wage celebration spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry against that, of cheap American slate gas to be pushed into the corner. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> When consequence works up a revolt, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift that to Paris onto eye level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Nevertheless Berlin does not need Paris more than gate for the political legitimization and Europe pressed his own economic policy which the changed French economy has to fight with. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Marine Le Pens rightly directed, EU enemy front National won just a decisive by-election and referred in this way the ruling socialists to place three. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The most popular party is to the front National now in France with 24 percent of the votes – a first-in first-out warning for the British Labour party, that it cannot come from that, a split in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatic for the left winger. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What makes Le Pen with theirs for popularity wonly again among the white French of the working class? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It would like to use the EU choices for that next year, one Anti-EU-, to forge anti-community currency block in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If the Anti-EU-Parteien come off at these choices well – and that is very well possible –, such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time then. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point onto which I want out: In future not far too far the wachsende resentment against the EU and the common currency will find itself for the abolition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but she will rather become something as the „Europe of the (sovereign) nations&quot; which favored general de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Maybe Germany and a few of his satellite-economies hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Great Britain distanziert of this project in the hope to ingratiate oneself with the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> However, Washington&apos;s increasing interest in the Pacific room advises that Great Britain will only stand in the Atlantic rain. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where does that have Scotland at all of them? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can decide, a region of to be (in last consequence) small England. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economical interests – to which also it belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what they where can put. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I presume Scotland could go in a looser European compound very well provided that we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The cooperation with countries other, thinking similarly is simpler in a Europe of the nations not föderierten. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise we should consider, to match it to Norway and our economical independence kept. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The SNP-government in Scotland is – bemerkenswerterweise – the most successful political movement against the saving-politics in Europe and gained in 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the shortenings suggested (and carried out) which the Labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to account for. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for an independence now only in order to get a saving-politics forcedly then from Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (but no mobile conversations lead) </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Flight travellers can hear now of the takeoff up to the landing their electronic devices for the reading, works playing, music and the renown of films use, not phone, however, with the mobile, so the new guidelines that were handed over by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> Nevertheless the passengers should not expect that these changes are transformed immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How they were implemented quickly would depend on the respective airline, declared FAA-employee Michael Huerta on a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowage of the devices according to the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA declared, she received already from some airlines plans that would like to build up the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Also delta and JetBlue were among these airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> „According to state of the plan we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices&quot;, announced the FAA in an announcement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Currently passengers must switch off smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> You may not start it before then again if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> With the case of the entry into the landing the passengers must switch it off again and they must not start again before the airplane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> To the new guidelines airlines whose airplanes are protected against electronic troubles could allow their passengers, the devices also at start, landing and the FAA declared to use on the landing field. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Most new airliners and other airmen which were adapted by Wi-Fi for the use in bigger heights should fulfill the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> „If the new regulation is secure moved – and we cooperate concerning that with the airline closely –, both page of that, Glading commented on,&quot; profit. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> We are it honestly said, to have to feel us with the case of this topic as overseers. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Nevertheless internet connections to the surf remained, the authority explained exchange of E-Mails, kept on being forbidden to plaintext messages or to download of data under three kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Passengers are asked to move smartphones, Tablets and other devices into the flight mode. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Therefore still no „Words With Friends&quot;, the online game resembling Scrabble that played the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone, than he public-effectively had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to switch off the device while the airplane was being parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> And heavier devices as laptops must be packed also furthermore since an injury danger exists here if they fly through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Mobile conversations during the flight keep on being forbidden also furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulation competence for telephone conversations is near the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA cancels possibly prohibition for certain electronic devices with the case of start and landing </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Last month mark of Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board said, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS news, mobiles would still be considered as a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> „To Handy are real a problem, not only because they could cause troubles potentially near navigation devices, but because we of the FCC know that the transfer from the air can interrupt also transmission fattenings&quot;, according to Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> A consultation committee of the branch which was started up by the FAA for the investigation of this topic recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In the last years the pressure increased itself to the FAA, to loosen restrictions on the use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Critics as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the opinion there are not any valid safety reasons for the prohibition </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the use of the devices became omnipresent. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> In some studies it is talked about that, that forgets up to a third of the passengers the shutdown of the device or ignores. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices through flight travellers after reports about troubles of navigation and communication devices through VHF-radios carried along by passengers which then represented the newest technique trend had become known. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as former generations of aircraft, but they are also so constructed and approved by the FAA, that them electronic interferences nothing form. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines are offering passengers Wi-Fi already for some years if the altitude is reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The airmen adapted onto Wi-Fi-systems are also more immune opposite interferences. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The predominant majority of the passenger planes should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices to the new guidelines, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The present electronic devices give in general considerably less radio radiation than former generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E-Reader give for example only minimum radiation if one umblättert. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> However, in the case of the download or sending of data the transmission parameters are stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Amazon.com numbers among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions on the device use through passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> In 2011 company employees loaded a passenger plane fuller Kindle E-Reader and did a test flight in order to determine problems, could not arrest, however, any. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings, which concerns to the risk during the use of devices. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he thinks, the trouble through the devices is really even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other committee members said there are only occasional reports by pilots who would speak for a trouble from airplane systems through the devices, and most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The committee recommended the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices in the case of instrument landing under bad view relations through the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and referred as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be endowed with technique today extensively. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> „We are pleased with the FAA recognizing that a pleasant passenger experience does not stand contrary to the security said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="1754"> Jumbo jet in search of the &quot;best ham of the world&quot;: For the TV-broadcasting &quot;Galileo&quot; the Pro7-star went to Bonndorf. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> The speaker explains now at the beginning: The pig clubs are the most important for the ham, turbo fattening is not in this case a good condition. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Can ham which one gets in every supermarket be therefore a quality product? </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Uli as a head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest declares Jumbo to &quot;eagle&quot; the working method of the company in Bonndorf. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Germany&apos;s dearest ham&quot;, as jumbo jet the black forests hams announces. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Only with hair-protection and smock it comes into the interior of the factory. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Also jumbo jet must disinfect erstmal the hands before he may reach for the micro. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Jumbo jet for the strengthening near Schnellimbiss screened in forest guard </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;Here I&quot; am &quot;worked&quot; to rießigen amounts the TV makers, Schwarzwälder hams as a standing article, are astonished. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> 16,000 clubs weekly speak for themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Weight fat part, color: Uli declares what it depends on with the case of the quality. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> Most pigs are slaughtered with six months. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Television with level? </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Also details as the Ph-Wert of the meat play a role. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The darker the meat, the more highly the pH-value. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;There I am tense, when their Roberto Blanco measure, what then happens&quot;, so jumbo jet cynical. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> Here the level of the private television in bacilli-culture is presented. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> But the watching is worthwhile in spite of that. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> The spectator sees that the dismantling of the clubs keeps on being handiwork. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Because: Schwarzwälder hams is to be found traditional without bones in the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo of a &quot;submarine&quot; optically. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> The trick: Fir branches guarantee here in the smoke for the special taste of the black forests ham. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Finally 20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> &quot;Now the disk disappears in the jumbo jet&quot;, it announces the Test-Verspeisung. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> &quot;That one is correctly delicious&quot;, so the upshot of the TV star. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In this way all participants involved will be able to live. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Joy city: Fast actions überrumpeln hosts </seg>
<seg id="1782"> With a narrow cadre the gentlemen I of the TSV joy city in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian one nightmare had to line up. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> The Älbler stood indeed with a practised team on the other net page </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Soon it was proved however, that they could completely not keep up, also age-conditional, with the fast actions of the joy town-dwellers. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> With the hard and placed impacts the Gönninger did themselves extremely heavily. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Repeated they missed that of Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly above the net middle passed passports and attacks and were not during the block defense to the place. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly the superiority of the joy town-dwellers in all interests </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Faced with this crushing and game-determining achievement the third sentence was gained then a little laxly and listlessly to the 3:0 closing balance (25:13, 25:14, 25:22). </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There a considerably more efficient opponent will stand on the 2nd November with the TV Baiersbronn which could continue in Nagold clearly on the field. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> TSV joy city of I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> In the B-class the second teams suited themselves in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn from Baiersbronn and opposite joy city. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> You delivered a two-hour-match in a hard way umkämpftes. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Nervousness on both pages caused particularly with the case of the ball assumption errors and dot presents; also with the case of the passports the precision was now and then scare commodity and in some critical mock bullfights the overeagerness prevented the look for possible dot profits. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> In this from the point of view of performance very much harmonious meeting the big physical use and a pleasant engagement of both teams was right in the TSV-team of Marcus Blasutto but altogether. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: No absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want to bind the inhabitants early into the planning&quot;, mayor Jens Häußler started the civil information event for the flood control draft in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> About 80 participants had come into the municipality hall in order to make oneself explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express objections and to bring in ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Häußler explained: The members of the district council make the final decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The high tide water, the Gechingen on 15th May 2009, in an unprepared way struck, a drastic event that raised the question about protective measures for the future was, according to Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river field investigation had been commissioned with the neighbor municipality Aidlingen which now is basis for the flood control draft in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;The protection most possible many plots&apos; built on is the objective so Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Taken as a basis is the planning the protection from an aloud German meteorological service statistical all high tides waters to be expected 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The climate change is taken to into account through a 15 per cent surcharge. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> In experts this with &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot; is described. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The water masses, that had led 2009 in Gechingen to considerable damages, corresponded to a 1000-year long high tide water. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement&quot;, so Häußler. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros at which the municipality can reckon country subsidies at the level of about 70 percent must be invested in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Häußler referred, however, to there being only the promotion if an overall concept is transformed. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> For this purpose the municipality is dependent onto the collaboration of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> An extensive planning and permission procedure must be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> Most at best the conversion can be begun with in 2016. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Among other things the protection concept sees, which was presented already in the last week in the district council (we told) local measures in the influx of the rivulet Irm from the Stammheimer valley in front of </seg>
<seg id="1813"> After the presentation of the flood control draft the participants took the opportunity for bringing in their requests. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Among other things was questioned, why more dams and moving hold basins are not planned to the protection of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregory Kühn, compartment planner of the charged engineering office forest and Corbe from hill home that presented the draft stressed that it requires the co-ordination of all presented measures in order to reach the wanted objective in the sum. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> In addition one is held to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald of forest and Corbe. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> There was annoyance with adjoining owners of the old place who have to suffer from an overloading of the sewer network again and again even in the case of normal thunderstorm rain. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The problem is known during the administration and first measures were already taken. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Häußler referred, however, to the guidelines being others for channel systems than for the flood control and this must not be mixed. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The municipality is obliged to lay out the sewer network so that rain events two to three year long could be verkraftet. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> To dimension the sewers in a larger way would entwine to millions. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The again designed Opschlag shines with a new Cafe. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> One that invites to the staying and returning. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> One which would like to turn the name into the program. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> One refers as Déjà Vu according to lexicon to a psychological phenomenon that the feeling is shown in by having experienced a new situation already once or seen. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town Kleve within sight to the college Rhein-Waal it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu-Gefühl. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly that to the objective to make an actual stay not only intellectual but solidly always recurringly erlebbar. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Because it does now fun and simply beautiful is. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A look into the inner life at the Opschlag 8 gives the observer immediately a good feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> The café-ambience state-of-the-art, but not cool looks like a place for the feeling well. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> Here the team with the founders Mirjam van of the Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with most different coffee or cocktail variants. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> For this purpose there are delicious cake or individually busy fresh French loaves. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The holders both 33 years old, made already before the opening of the neat café at the Opschlag as gastronomes a name: In Kranenburg they led the &quot;Art Lounge&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The agreeable café-lovers expect more public from the move after Kleve onto the Opschlag. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Last but not least also through the college </seg>
<seg id="1836"> &quot;At what we do not have any certain target group&quot; stress Daniel Büttner. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Rather here young students would like to speak to the two just the same as seniors and all age groups between that. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> Apropos café-lover. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The agreeable holder pair stands behind the coffee-pleasure </seg>
<seg id="1840"> Enjoy the smelling hot brew in the most different variations themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Expressofan </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The Expresso fan and Mirjam van of the Stelt is Daniel Büttner rather the cappuccino alcoholic. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> &quot;For this purpose a French loaf - that is my thing, the NRZ betrays it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> There were already two events in the bright café. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> Better said one. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Because the harbor celebration occurred really rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not profit by that. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> But there was also the Ringelnatzabend. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> The two 33-year long ones found, &quot;beautiful, successful and witty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> But now not Everyone&apos;s thing. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in view of great orders about seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Between leading airplane manufacturers it resulted in a quarrel over the width of seats in the tourist class with the case of long-distance flights what gives the clay to Dubai Airshow for a bitter collision on that one this month. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The quarrel turns around the seat width that is offered to passengers in the case of long flights in the tourist class – not always those ones, airlines make an effort for those ones the most, however, this shown room puts SAS and Boeing Co the key from airbus for the efficiency claims at the newest airplanes. dar. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus required this week a branch standard, one seat-wide of at least 46 cm (18 customs) in the tourist class specifies, however, the US American ore rival Boeing says the airlines should decide on that. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The quarrel comes to a time since the airplane cages compete for selling even greater versions of their zweimotorigen long stretch airmen and expect record tasks of the 17th to 21st November during the event. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> How the rear part of the airplane is built up – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is decisive for the indicated economical results which the new „mini-jumbo jet design „is supposed to supply. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing says his modernized „777X&quot; grabs 406 persons near seats in the tourist class that more than 17 customs are wide and allow so ten per row </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus declares, the concurrent version of the A350 carries 350 persons in 18 customs wide seats in the tourist class with the case of which there are nine per row </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Airplane giants distribute frequently blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Now airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will probably do the race. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Recently the enterprise presented an advertisement which are the beginning of a new advertisement war can and financiers a picture showed, in which three persons are squashed in a restaurant, and for this purpose the title: „You would accept that&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1870"> „Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats which are narrower than regional Turbo-Props&quot;, says airbus marketing leader John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Faced with changed feeding habits the people become fatter, however, airplane seats did not change radically. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Between the early 1970ern, than the Boeing defined the modern long stretch journey in 747, and to the at the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The waist extent of the masculine average American in the 21st century is according to US American health statistics 100.8 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says his rival sticks to a seat draft from the 1950ern when the average body extent of the freshly christened „jet set&quot; was narrower. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> One has carried on, so airbus, investigations, the busy ones, that one additional customs (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality around 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing denies the numbers of airbus to the seat measures and says, to decide in the discretion of the manufacturers how airlines arrange the balance between flight rates and equipment it does not stand. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The enterprise also declares according to investigations the experience hangs in the airplane from more than the seat width. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> „It really comes to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do that what they according to their opinion must in order to be successful&quot; the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing explains. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> You would not like, that we dictate to them what makes it profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> You know their business better than anyone else does. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers it is a question of more elbow-room, but for manufacturers it becomes in increasing measure a topic which can affect the turnovers </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Behind the quarrel a race stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion United States dollars according to list prices in the coming decades, which could affect the export balance of the USA or Europe lastingly </seg>
<seg id="1883"> As Reuters in July for the first time reported, the seat layout is the floating strength behind the quarrel around the new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with the case of their newest zweimotorigen long stretch designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige of Boeing 77-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> The statements of Boeings for the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in that one in 777. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The climbed costs per unit are still smaller than at currently used machines with ten seats per row </seg>
<seg id="1887"> „Boeing squashes therefore more seats into his airplane in order to turn it into our product more competitively&quot;, says Kevin Keniston, conductor for passenger comfort at the European airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at available 777s indicated that many passengers decided for the narrower order, what could be accompanied by cheaper flight rates. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> „Eighteen customs seat width would be fabulous for passengers, however the reality is: from an economical point of view the airbus-offer headed&quot; from the threat&quot; &quot;through the 777 of them&quot;, says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin equipment Gründerin and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing do not offer any seats, but a catalog of subcontractors which the airlines can select from. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The world-traveling jet sales assistants bear even measuring tape with themselves in order to measure the equipment with the case of the competition </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they recommend the comfort nevertheless all manufacturers offer also jets with highly condensed arranging for cheap airlines and regional flights so. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows did not sell, however, yet any according to own statement </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently airbus showed how more adaptability of the cabins is importantly and wide seats demanded for some jets at the walks </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of big modern jets experts say that the call after a new branch standard will presumably blow up, but could turn away from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> The Veganismus is subordinated to the vegetarianism according to lexicons, distinguishes from this, however, nevertheless in very considerable way </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Because while vegetarians are allowing themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice or a strong Edam cheese, these Schlemmereien do not stand on the menu of a Veganers. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Milk, the Veganer lets cheeses, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish of the all consumption of animal products off - also honey is denied. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> One likes to wonder what remains, however, in the case of nearer consideration the vegane feeding world is characterized by a considerable imaginativeness. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Spreads are very popular&quot;, declares Ute Henkelmann, the holder of the local health food store who prepares a great number of specific products for Veganer. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Also Reuben Proctor goes to the shop in the cathedral lane gladly. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> For 13 years the native New Zealander is living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) all which he needs to the life. &quot;In 1997 I changed my feeding and Vegetarier became&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Around the turn of the century then the next step occurred and I became Veganer. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came, however, not only because of the feeding but due to the shoe choice&quot;, says Proctor who prefers imitation leathers to normal leather. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> He recognized that it works also in other everyday interests without animal products. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> In the first place is vegan be an ethic. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I do not want animals to have to die for me&quot; expresses the maxim of the Veganer which applies to the entire consumer behavior Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> To mourn instead of Burgern, Rühreiern or rubber bears, the Veganer discovered quickly very new products that enthusiasm increased at. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;It is a double bonus&quot;, says Proctor today, &quot;in fact sets vegan be no renunciation no asceticism dar, but it is an enrichment&quot;. Proctor rather puts down the assumption that one reduces the selection with the feeding adaptation at food options to the power of the habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> And exactly these conditionings let also some still so well-meant attempt fail. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The addiction factor is a very decisive factor, which makes many be given up quickly, similarly as while smoking&quot;, Proctor sets up a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> And objects: &quot;Certain tastes are not to be identified with the animal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Often it is the spices or the kind of the dressing which define the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;One can produce, however, the same effect also in another manner&quot;, the Veganer clarifies. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> For a barbecue Proctor brings along for example aubergines, champignons and also a few Veganwürste. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> It pays attention to a balanced, varied feeding with the case of which it is absolutely supposed to taste also once solid. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Of course one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It is supposed to taste good, but that is not to reduce&quot; only to animal food&quot;, according to Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> He did not suffer sanitary damages up to Essstörungen, a further widespread assumption </seg>
<seg id="1920"> For me the adaptation had a positive aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I do not incorporate any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin part. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;My blood values are at best, I make myself be often checked&quot;, Proctor betrays. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Many Vegansimus-critics warn in particular against the lack of vitamin B12. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;Since animals are fed with fodders instead of grazing on the pasture it is questionable whether in the meat which one buys in the freezer the vitamin-B12-part is high&quot;, thinks Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For Veganer there is furthermore the possibility to take the co-enzyme in shape of trays to himself </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B12-values are in order&quot;, it declares. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Widens ways must go Proctor for the food procurement not. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Finally there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has in the meantime soya milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> I find all which I need on site. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Only now and then I buy something specific. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive now, but so it also behaves near usual finished products as is generally known&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Anyhow the dressing of veganer courts is by far more favorable and less time-consuming than gemeinhin accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;In the house kitchen it gives to discover a lot, with a few small tricks can one good if results not in part better achieve&quot; Proctor says. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his veganen cheesecakes could bring also his parents-in-law to Proctor to the astonishment. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> The Veganer gives a new spice to family celebrations. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> That has dynamics, if one cooks together, that has a new significance. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations which in this case can arise are as different as the people themselves&quot; are, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Of course skepticism was already evinced for it however. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Does my food not like to you anymore? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> &quot;I am supposed to feel now bad because I drink milk&quot;? - with the case of such kinds of questions one must act as Veganer with intuition. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I do not refuse the people, I am a part of this society Proctor would not like to survive any enclave existence. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And the everyday life world does not appear in a more exact way considered then at all as veganfremd as presumed - and the Veganer not restricted so in the everyday life as gemeinhin accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Also Fast Food is allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> There are chips everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many Dönerläden offer Falafel, or now a vegetarian Yufka&quot;, Proctor says. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> In a pizzeria he switches to paste courts or orders now a pizza without cheeses, everything a question of the habit. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The restaurants appear so slowly on that. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> &quot;When I 13 years ago started eating vegan, everything was still much more difficult&quot;, the New Zealander can make a development ausfindig: &quot;One must talk to the people, make it attentive on that&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;If sufficient demands come, they are inclined maybe in order to complement the menu&quot; it hopes. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Vegane restaurants develop, as for example the galley into Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Proctor cherishes the wish, that also other restaurants have stood at least a veganes court on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Basically vegane courts are for all of them there. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of excluding. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> &quot;On the other hand meat dishes are excluding, and indeed in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others&quot; Proctor finds. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> &quot;If one wants to avoid food scandals, Veganismus is then a secure way to make the biggest part from the beginning impossible&quot;, says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The purchase of veganer products can be, however, at the beginning a little difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Contain that also into peanuts, in particular when one learns to understand, animal additives as color donors his can, one seems the courage to leave with the compliance of the ethic near so many hurdles and traps quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Not only therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: &quot;Veganissimo - Animal contents materials and their alternatives&quot; explains the many contents materials that Food- however also detergents are buried. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> &quot;Little by little one develops a scanner look and white, to which signs and logos one has to pay attention It is&quot; Proctor &quot;to do small steps sometimes better than to conk out or to stumble,&quot; white. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The Veganismus, he is an important moral hint that beats onto the consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Maybe it does completely not manage that one puts aside his habits, however, at least it can teach the consumer to question his habits critically </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Bavaria&apos;s basketball player in spite of first defeat optimistic </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not curtail the gigantic optimism to Bavaria Munich with the basketball players of the FC. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> &quot;Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning also against the best team of Europe of the last two years&quot; bilanzierte Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) at the Thursday evening with title defender of Olympiakos of Piräus. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> We sent the message: Also in Munich basketball exists! </seg>
<seg id="1967"> At theirs first third appearance in the European royal class sold the inhabitants of Munich long very good, were in the decisive phases not clarified, however, simply enough. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> The guests created the trick first of all, still to convert some 15-point remains into a leadership 13 minutes for end before Piräus gave a turn to the game once again. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> &quot;We fought us incredibly back against the double Euroleague champion, done, however, then again frivolous errors Bavarian pro Yassin Idbihi said. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> We are proud of our achievement but we want to gain every game. </seg>

<seg id="1972"> New anti-nicotine-vaccine could do the Garaus to the pleasure with the case of the smoking </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Scientists developed an anti-nicotine-vaccine which could spoil the fun at the smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> A single dose of the vaccine could long protect mice against nicotine addiction a life. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> For tests at the human being even further attempts are needed which can last still some years, however, professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> „We are very hopeful, that this kind can help millions of smokers that attempted to stop and in this case all methods available on the market tried out, but that had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches from vaccinating-strategy once&quot;, so Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus which was changed so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine-antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus infects selectively the liver cells which then produce a constant stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain through which a smoker does not find out any Nikotin-High. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In attempts vaccinated mice to which nicotine was given retained their normal activity level. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Mice without inoculation on the other hand would have taken a „time-out&quot;, declared the researchers, a sign, for the nicotine reaching their brain. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The experiments are described in the technical journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The inoculations had to be given for the maintaining of the antibody turn-off level so frequently that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Nevertheless the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it changes liver cells into antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> As professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to children for people if it is sure before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent so nicotine addiction </seg>
<seg id="1987"> It is more probable, however, that smokers would use it in order to stop. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> „You know then: If they resume smoke, they do not feel any pleasure anymore in this case because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them with putting aside the habit&quot; it explains. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> British scientists said, the results are interesting, they warned, however, simultaneously, it even further research is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Guillaume Nicloux&apos; Adaptation of the novel of Denis Diderot convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, also heavier food is, however, than necessary. </seg>

<seg id="1995"> Egypt vereidigt first freely elected president </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Mohammed Mursi takes the office oath, however, his day of the triumph might not mean the end of the political quarrels in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a „new Egypt&quot;, than he was vereidigt as a first freely elected president of the country and in this way the succession of Husni Mubarak lined up that 16 months before had been marketed from the office. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> With his inauguration in front of the uppermost constitution court Mursi became fifth head of state also to the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arabian world and Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which has his seat at the Nile and an antiquated Egyptian nachempfunden temple is. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> „We move to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic&quot;, said Mursi during the solemn ceremony which was transferred live in the state television. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> „Heute put the Egyptian nation the foundation for a new life –&quot; the 60-year old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim brotherhood, of a fundamentalist group that had been taken into the visor by the respective government since their foundation 84 years ago mostly as prohibited organization sharply said „absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, as Mursi shortly to eleven o&apos;clock local time in a small car convoy arrived. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Only a few hundreds of supporters had met before the court in order to cheer to the new president, and unlike the presidential splendor from the Mubarak-time the traffic was stopped only on a short-term basis so that the car convoy could cross the usually animated street that connects the city center with the southern suburbs. </seg>

<seg id="2005"> „Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state&quot;, declared the Mursi dressed in a blue suit with red tie the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he took the office oath. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Later Mursi went to the university from Cairo, where it should hold his inaugural address. </seg>

<seg id="2009"> With the case of his arrival he was welcomed from hundreds of person presents in the biggest lecture hall of the university with speaking choruses of „The army and the nation are a hand&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The university of Cairo founded in the year 1908 as a bastion of secular education developed in the 1970th years into a stronghold of Islamic student groups. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> Mursi took on Friday a symbolic oath on the Tahir-place to zurückfordern the birth place of the revolt that led last year at the end of the authoritarian domination, and vowed to Mubaraks presidential power that the military council had taken over from the head of state hunted from the office. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> Nevertheless with the storing of the official oath in front of the court and not as usually before the parliament bows down it the will of the military, what refers to the power fight going on. </seg>

<seg id="2015"> With 60 years as singers Hubert Wermters is history near the man choral society Cäcilia as those of the Herbsfestes in whose frames he was honored solemnly almost twice for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his man choral society on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Also after 60 years the singing with the choir meanwhile presumably more than dearly gained does him still great fun. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> In the association Wermter was also active among other things 28 years long as a member of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> For his engagement and his association faith he received now several distinctions: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented a document of the association and an honor letter signed by bishop Gebhard Fürst to him - since the choir is also a choir. </seg>

<seg id="2037"> Passengers that attempted to go around these stuffed therefore so much as possibly into the hand luggage, which results in the consequence that the luggage lockers are frequently full above the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Fees are a possibility to convince passengers of that less to take Bord. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> O&apos;Malley said with the case of the new fee it is really not a question of earning money. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> It is a question of the most loyal customers of statute labor animal to have expressed clearly that it becomes increasingly heavier to find place in the compartment above the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers do not have to pay that buy your tickets on the web site of the airline. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> That means that a passenger may take along a piece of luggage freely from statute labor animal possibly at the gate, the next person, however, must pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O&apos;Malley declared the web site of statute labor animal and the Check-in-Verfahren would be changed so that the passengers are informed of the fee before they would come to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The new hand luggage fee of statute labor animal does not come into force before in the summer, there is not an exact date yet. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers swear frequently about baggage surcharges and other fees however, airlines fall back gladly to that. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> You argue, that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Many at the rampart Street consider the new baggage fees as signs for the airlines taking enough money in order to cover the costs of air trips after years of the losses. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Most let up to now the fingers of fees however, for Handgepäck. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as First Fees for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap airman followed. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The single other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, declared the Airline-Berater Jay Sorensen who pursues the addition fees attentively. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> He reckoned in a report by December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit is 50 million United States dollars worth annually. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Sorensen that formerly held a leadership position with Midwest Airlines flew recent with Spirit and was curious, what it at the gate would expect, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> „The Boarding-process belonged to the smoothest which I experienced in my career in the aviation&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> I expected to see tooth crunching and obvious discussions at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> „The airplane was full&quot;, it declared, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Statute labor animal follows Spirit also at the 2 dollars which are demanded for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The enterprise declared that passengers who bought lemonade or juice might keep the whole can and coffee is refilled gratis. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Water keeps on being free. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> US Airways had attempted in 2008 on a short-term basis to demand money for soft drinks, this made however, seven months later again declining, after passengers had complained and had tightened no other large society </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Statute labor animal&apos;s step, to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly near the airline is the recent initiative with which customers are supposed to be directed to the own web site. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Airlines pay online travel agencies as Orbitz 10 to 25 United States dollar per sold ticket. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> That provides all societies with a stimulus, to convince passengers of the direct purchase with them instead of above an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Statute labor animal is widest in this field however, gone. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> In September the enterprise began with assigning so much Vielfliegermeilen in the case of booking about an online travel agency only still half. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again on 25 percent of the flight stretch </seg>
<seg id="2066"> An air trip booked with a third provider with statute labor animal above 1000 miles is only another 250 miles to customers worth therefore. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Passengers can reserve also exclusively places during the direct purchase on the web site of statute labor animal. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Statute labor animal has a loyal clientele at his seat in Denver, nevertheless the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> The proceeds decreased about 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank just 13 percent in the first quarter as in the financial statement is to read that on Wednesday of the mother company group, Republic Airways holding companies Inc was published.. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Republic attempted to get the finances of statute labor animal into the grip within the framework of the sale of the society </seg>

<seg id="2095"> „You are convinced from that of their son being murdered&quot;, declared Benjamin Crump, the attorney of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> You would never have believed, he died so as the sheriff concluded it. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> „You think that it lacks every logic against which expels laws of the physics as also against the healthy human intellect&quot;, according to Crump. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Rather they are convinced, the truth is hushed up in order to protect the person or persons that are responsible for the death of their son. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> It comments, „your son went for the learning into the school and came in the corpse bag back&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> US public prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal determination for the death of Johnsons since a series of important questions are still unclear. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> What was the death cause? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Is his death to be put down to a crime? </seg>
<seg id="2103"> That declared bogs at a press conference in the Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> I follow the facts, to which direction they also lead. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> It is my objective to find out the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> „I represent the opinion that a sufficient basis exists for a formal determination he said. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> Moore declared opposite reporters the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson had passed away at the consequences of a „position-conditional suffocation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> A second autopsy showed, however, another death cause, according to Moore. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> „There is a series of questions which must be answered or confirmed&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Moore added, if there are sufficient proofs of a legal or civil law investigation for the death of Johnsons, he will charge the FBI the realization of the investigations. </seg>

<seg id="2126"> A softening of the defensive attitude of the USA with respect to their monitoring programs programs pointed out to John Kerry with an unexpected admission when he said, the espionage went in certain cases inappropriately too far. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> The foreign minister of State in addition admitted it would bear together with Barack Obama the responsibility for one switching to „autopilot&quot; when the explosive disclosures of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden became public about the espionage activities of the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Through the seeped information the US government is into a diplomatic storm of the indignation vonseiten their ally guessed. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> With the case of a speech transmitted by video connection on the Open Government-Konferenz in London Kerry said: „Completely without question the president and I as well as others in the government heard about some things that ran as it were by autopilot simple because the ability for this purpose existed, what still onto the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War as well as natural on the 11th September goes back.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Afterwards he admitted as a first hochrangiges member of the US American government that the US espionage crossed a border it also stressed, however, that no rights were misused. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> He said: „In some cases that went inappropriately too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The president is decided to create clearness and carries out therefore a thorough investigation so that nobody has to have the feeling here abuse occurs. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not influenced in this process </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Kerry insisted, however, on the NSA being a strength of the good one and many lives being saved by their monitoring processes. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> He added: „We have to do it with a new world in which people are ready to blow oneself up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2136"> It gives blowing up a radical extremism in the world to which on that it is crazy to kill people and attacking governments. </seg>

<seg id="2140"> Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut did not tell about the supervision anymore it spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is worried because of their threats due to the frustration through the National Security Agency at anti-terror organizations involve. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> „It is very important for the national security interests of the USA, that the Europeans with regard to our common efforts against the terrorism with stay on board&quot;, declared Murphy that is as a democrat for the first time in the senate and is active for non-resident relationships and European matters as a chairperson of the senate sub-committee in an interview in Washington. </seg>

<seg id="2164"> What has it with the action day and the helpers on themselves? </seg>
<seg id="2165"> Bauhaus provides the material with support of the savings bank Zollernalb. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It is supplied on the agreed day into the kindergarten and is supposed to be processed then directly by the helpers. </seg>

<seg id="2171"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the senate that are important for the decision whether the CO2- and be deleted to mining industry taxes or abbreviated. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> However, Palmer said that only ministers could have interest conflicts and the daughters would profit by Abbott personally from the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> „It is in a great interest conflict if it is a question of paid parent vacation, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in that, whether she receives vacation or not&quot;, Palmer said. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> The choice commission Palmer with 53 voices declared two months after the choice to the new counting officially according to projection to the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-Sitzes of fair fax. </seg>

<seg id="2178"> „We need a better system&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Why should we not have any system with the case of which one marches, enters the data in a computer, chooses immediately and has the result then at 6:30 o&apos;clock in the evening? </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Palmer criticized also the use of pencils in the event of the marking of the ballot papers. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> Does one use it because one, when one does not like them, can erase the results? </seg>
<seg id="2182"> To vote nowadays with pencils is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> The choice commission examined the options for an electronic choice and published recently a common law proposal with New Zealand. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Esa decides on great space missions: Missions for billions </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the European space travel agency must agree now on two large projects which want to start it in the next years. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 proposals were selectable, five are still in the running. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Far worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Astronomers already found more than 1000 planets at other stars. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> No one knows whether at least there are lives on some of them. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The selection is difficult: Is one supposed to search for gravitational waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Or investigating the origin of the cosmos more gladly? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Or searching for earth-similar planets and discovering maybe extraterrestrial life in this way? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> These questions are just asked to the European space travel agency Esa the persons responsible in charge. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For their program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; they search ideas for two great space travel projects which are supposed to voranbringen the research decisively. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such &quot;l-missions&quot; is in each case about instance near a billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The start will be 2028 and 2034 probable. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> At the beginning of September the elite of the European astrionics met in Paris, around proposals for such missions to discuss. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were under discussion, five of them were short-listed now. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Numerous committees examine the proposals haken with the researchers after. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> In the next days a final decision is supposed to fall through the scientific program committee. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> The Esa onto which the missions of the program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; initiated in 2007 are supposed to find Answers selected in total four great questions. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the origin of planets and lives? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact processes during the formation of stars from big gas clouds - and in this way also the origin of planets that circle these stars - lie still in the proverbial darkening. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A big infrared telescope in the space could penetrate this darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> And if a star has planets, under which circumstances life can arise there? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> In order to follow this question, the space telescope &quot;Cheops&quot; with which 500 already known planetary systems are examined in our nearer surroundings in a more exact way is supposed to start in 2017. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The possibilities are, however, restricted, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With bigger instruments the astronomers could show earth-similar planets and analyze them even the composition of their atmospheres and search them so according to &quot;Biomarkern&quot;: To gases which are valid as an index for biological activity. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system function? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Also this question is supposed to give ultimately information about which conditions there are for the origin of lives. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of his magnetic field as well as the particle radiation going out of it with the planetary system. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> With the &quot;Solar Orbiter&quot; the Esa granted already a mission of the M-class (there the budget is near about instance half a billion of euros) for this question. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe is supposed to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun exactly. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> From great interest in the researchers also Jupiter and his moons are. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> You want to find out which role the giant planet played during the development of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> For that the Esa plans the first of the in total three L-missions of the &quot;Cosmic vision&quot;-program. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The probe &quot;Juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probably begins their journey in 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the basic physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The cosmos offers many possibilities, matter to study under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether the natural laws, known to us, are still valid there. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Maybe also deviations which could show the way for a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united to the physicists are found. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> How did the universe arise and of what does it consist </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Before 13.7 billion years our cosmos arose through the Urknall. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Next to the matter, us common, from the stars, planets and living beings how we withstand, there are Dark matter whose force of gravity galaxies and galaxy heaps hold together, and Dark Energy, the expansion of the cosmos at an accelerated rate through their work. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Neither up to now the researchers do not know yet which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Urknalls from which withstand Dark Matter and Dark Energy. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> With &quot;Euclid&quot; the Esa granted also here already a M-mission whose start is planned for 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> With a specific telescope the distribution of the matter is supposed to examine the probe for the first time in the universe at the entire sky and facilitate so inferences onto the state of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could do the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> From the 30 proposals only two will remain at the end of the selection method. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> &quot;E-Lisa&quot;, a pretentious draft has the best chances on an approval as a L-mission in opinion of many experts as proof of gravitational waves. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Physicists mean changes in the structure of the room time by that, the Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago had predicted. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> They were not proved until today. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could create that, the scientists hope behind the project. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes which is stationed in the space. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It could prove unlike installations on the earth also gravitational waves which arose with the case of the Urknall, and supply so new findings about the origin of the cosmos. </seg>

<seg id="2248"> It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in an in stock way – the car-injection of the brand EpiPen is used most frequently – in order to be able to encounter a potentially fatal Überempfindlichkeitsreaktion. </seg>

<seg id="2250"> In the report also a list is contained typical symptoms that are named by children that show an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Maybe children say: „It feels as if something presses onto my tongue My tongue feels, as if a hair lies on that&quot; or „My tongue itches&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2283"> At the border between Mexico and the USA observers discovered and deactivated a &quot;super-tunnel&quot; for the drug smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> As the US customs authorities informed, the more than 500 meters long tube was endowed with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilating system between Tijuana and San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Three suspects were arrested accordingly, confiscated eight tons of marihuana as well as almost 150 kilograms of cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The tunnel had not been taken according to the information in use yet. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> &quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they could &quot;durchgraben&quot; under the radar&quot; the general state attorney of the US district Southern California, Laura Duffy said, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Turned onto the drug gangs Duffy insured: &quot;If your wide builds such tunnels and attempts to use it, we are decided to turn that into a gigantic waste of your dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous-fight against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Since became 2006 in Mexico more than killed to 77th 000 people in connection with the drug criminality. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Constructed by experts </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel the observers assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction used about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> The railway construction siding track was so equipped, that there electrical practiced cars could be used. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> On Mexican page the access lies in a building which is 80 meters of the border away. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> According to authorities a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entry </seg>

<seg id="2303"> Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This shows the &quot;despair&quot; of the drug gangs whose traditional routes are meanwhile cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug search DEA in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> You would do everything in order to reach the USA. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> To the arrested ones no details were announced, Mexikaner is to at least one, it was said. </seg>

<seg id="2308"> Obamas moving-snag in the healthcare policy </seg>
<seg id="2309"> According to vehement criticism president Obama made yesterday a moving-snag with the case of his frequently repeated, unequivocal promise: „If you like your health insurance, you can keep it then.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2310"> After Hunderttausende of their insurer received a written notice, the republicans reproached the president in the last days, it deceived the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Yesterday Obama relocated his initial promise. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> „They can keep the predominant majority of the citizens who have a functioning health insurance&quot;, he said with the case of a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> As reaction to the numerous media reports for the notices Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance on the free market. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Most citizens can such a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favorably than predicts receive. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> „You come a better offer&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The government referred to it as little surprising, that the five percent of the population that finished even an insurance according to another rate would have to look around, since their contract does not correspond to the new standards to the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> „I would like to say to these Americans very directly: You earned better one&quot;, said Sebelius with the case of a hearing in front of the energy and commercial sow shot of the House of Representatives in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Sebelius which is responsible for the conversion of the Affordable Care Acts declared that the start of the online-platform since October proceeded „miserably&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> „I am also just as frustrated and furious as all others are&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I am decided to recover your confidence. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> This saying of an angry Sebelius to a consultant being behind it during the hearing of yesterday in the House of Representatives was incorporated after a quarrel conversation with the republican representative Billy Long from Missouri. In this case it worked around whether it should be obliged to the participation in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> To finish after more than three hours of hearing badgered Long Sebelius repeatedly with the question why the „architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Acts did not renounce a from a government viewpoint supported insurance voluntarily around even a rate at HealthCare.gov which she wants to sell to millions of Americans now. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Parents of intersexual children can choose „Sex indefinitely&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is acknowledged for children who were born with genitals not unequivocal </seg>
<seg id="2325"> More is not assigned to newborns inflexibly manly or in a feminine way. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> According to the new law parents do not have to explain any sex more for such children, but can indicate „indefinite&quot; or „not defined&quot; on the birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> It is an objective of the law to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make any rash decisions with respect to operations for a sex assignment with newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> An intersexual person said years later according to BBC: „I am not either Mann or woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I remain the patchwork which was created by doctors, mutilated and full scars. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Approximately one thing does not come from 2,000 children to the world every year either as a boy or as girls. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> You belong to the intersexual ones, a group that falls under the diagnosis „Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung&quot; (DSD) a comprehensive term term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (Eierstöcken or testicles) or unusually genitals developed. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> The sense of the sex identification is not yet very well developed, nevertheless most experts recommend that in the USA, one is supposed to use the best available information to the sex assignment if a definition is not possible, and wait not for the psychological and physical development of the child, before one decides – when anyway – for an operation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The New York psychiatrists&apos; Dr. Jack Drescher who specialized on the problems natures of the sex identification said the new German law „rings to a good thing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Intersexual Children represent an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> „Some people have life-alarming illnesses which require a surgical intervention, however, that is not valid for most children&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> One can carry out a sex assignment without operation and wait for it then, as the identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data above how a child develops anyway his sexual identity are not very exactly. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Nobody knows why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It is as the secret why people are homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report onto the European commission from the year 2011 is called it, intersexual people are of transsexual or to distinguish Transgender persons, because their status is not sex-gotten, but necessitated by their biological constitution that neither is not feminine manly yet exclusively, but typically both simultaneously or not defined as one thing by that clearly. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These properties were proved in lower-level sexual characteristics as muscle measures, hairiness, breasts and stature, major sexual characteristics as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> The report gives also an overview of the discrimination, that intersexual and see Transgender persons abandoned in the professional life as well as about the extent of molestation, power and prejudice criminality. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Boys agreeing not with the sex picture have a specific camp now. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> Meanwhile it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents masculine, feminine or to declare „third sex&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as worldwide a first „sexless&quot; person after a court had granted the lifelong retention of a sex status „not defined&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> German identity cards have a third assignment, X for intersexual in the future next to M and W, according to the Ministry of the Interior Office. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In the adjacent France sex topics are still controversial, such a notification of message on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In 2011 French representatives of the severely Catholic country signed dozens a petition, that the „sex theory&quot; is supposed to be removed from school books. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The US American web site Catholic Online spoke out also against the German law, with the reason: „If the world is dragged into a new state, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, however, not, then we twist two more columns of the civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared opposite baby zone she would find it better if a sex is assigned to babies at the birth. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> „The parent existence is already stressful enough also without further restrictions especially if one&quot; does not „know&quot; the sex of the own child, she said to the parent web site. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Children were seen historical to, that both with masculine as also feminine genitals were given birth, than described to hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God that had both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Still ten years ago the medicine considered the sex as something which one can wipe out and establish again then. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Nevertheless meanwhile the ethical basics of an operation are doubted after now known is, how the sexual identity is in a complex way, and that doctors can be also wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with the sex assigned by them. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> „In the middle of the 20th century one mentioned that a ,psychiatrischen emergency&quot; Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If such a child was born, one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon then. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with genitals not unequivocal goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University who represented the opinion the sex is plastic. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> It shaped the concept „sexual identity&quot; and argued, social and environment-conditional impulses – as the parents bring up a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped so, whether a person considers herself as masculine or feminine. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> However in a case become known under the title „John/Joan&quot; from the year 1966 his theories became controversial. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> He recommended the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated at a bungled curtailment completely to castrate the child and to remove also his testicles and to raise him then as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> „Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he, however, was&quot; not, according to Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> As the boy about 15 was, it returned to the masculine sex and a woman got married. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> With 38, however, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to Drescher there are still doctors who would practise this model. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> However in the 1990th years, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations stepped onto the public that is not „happy with the result&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> So about instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana that was born with XY-masculine chromosomes, however, ambiguous genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The doctors were not clear about that, whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced, it can never lead a „satisfactory living&quot; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Therefore his external organ and the testicles shortly after the birth 1976 were removed surgically and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> In the age of 12 he received feminine hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> „I knew that I am not a girl&quot;, it declared opposite ABCNews.com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unhappy, but it was really heavy to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> In the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic </seg>
<seg id="2375"> Nevertheless since it was depressive and knew, that something was not right, it demanded his medical files. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What he found out was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever said that to me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After his having found out the truth, he changed again for the masculine identity, received testosterone injections and made remove his breasts. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Through the operation he became infertile. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today he fights for others in an organization by the name of interface Project for intersexual people as normal being perceived. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> However Anne Tamar-Mattis, manageress of the right group of Advocates for Informed Choice resident in californiums, worries, that the German law to the stamping and Stigmatisieren can encourage. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> „Many activists are worried, that the German decision could encourage parents, to assign&quot; fast decisions to hit and the child a ,nicht defined‘, she declared. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We fear that favors interventions. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think it would be better the masculine or feminine sex to assign and to wait then. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> However nor we do not know how the law will affect, therefore we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the recognition for adults possible as a third sex&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> „Adults should be in the situation to make own decisions on their legal sex&quot;, it declared. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> With the case of the German law it is a question of the assignment at the birth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> That is not a fight which one should force small children to this time to. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> If they are grown-up, they themselves can decide on their body. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation trouble and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group says the German law „authorizes&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with masculine chromosomes, a DSD has, however, by the name of complete androgen resistance. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for Testosteron Katie developed feminine characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> It has a vagina, however no uterus and no ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Today Katie 29 is and marries; she works on the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Indeed it is infertile, hopes, however, for being able to get a child through adoption or a lending-mother. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> „The law gives parents to room through which she does not rush decisions must hit&quot;, Baratz said. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> It provides them with the time, to do different tests and to clear things and time gives so to them before they „manly&quot; or „in a feminine way&quot; write. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this way everything is all right – one raises the child and loves it. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parent luck. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And one does not have to carry out rashly an operation which cannot be canceled anymore. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> „That closes the children into the decision with one and removes the fear that drives parents because they think they would not „do&quot; the correct thing&quot; explained it. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Finally the child decides on the sex that co-ordinates to it better – and that is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Through that children are moved into the situation to make the decision itself. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellent the fight mastered </seg>
<seg id="2407"> The role of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novelette &quot;The old man and the sea&quot;, is cut to Horst Janson onto the body. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Janson is even an old hare in his profession, the dramatic art. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> The old man Santiago cannot fool to any during the fishing. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> So the two of them complement themselves simply splendidly. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> One almost thinks to be able to see the wrinkles in the nape of the old man which the Fisherman-Young Manolo speaks of. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> If Santiago in a tired way of the life fits bently on the chair, that is really at Janson. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Next to that the role of the old fisherman through and through is a character role which Janson masters excellently. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Hemingway told the history of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally gains the fight through his knowledge and also his will strength against the fish. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Janson is in wide stretches as alone actors on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> It manages to focus the attention of the public on himself so that his monologs are no moment boring. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> His efforts, to grow the fish at last onto the surface of the water, are so really that the spectators forget that nevertheless the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Director Jens Hasselmann makes the old man in the boat before the fishing village act. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> During the performance he puts the in each case active scene in the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, that with theirs songs&apos; and their marvellous voice&apos;s the joy of living of Cuba records. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> The four musicians play Cuba&apos;s rhythm for this purpose and are at the same time guests of the bars. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Fancy for ice cream which shines in the dark? </seg>
<seg id="2422"> A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – with the aid of jellyfishes. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Charlie Francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea animals zunutze and a radiant titbit created from that. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The idea on that came to him after he had read a study work about jellyfishes and could convince Chinese scientists to make the radiant protein artificially </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The ice cream reacts with the case of the consumption with the tongue by which the pH-value is raised in the protein and the brightness activated. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Chris declares, the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and that shines – more each therefore one licks the brighter it becomes. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious&quot;, says: „The product is incredible, however still in a very early production phase, and so one gets two grams of that for 200 pounds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with the case of a neutral pH-value. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH-value increases and the ice shines. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> We tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it at Halloween because it has this wonderful shining-effect. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream which I ever manufactured, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold is. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Every ball costs me about 140 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> But for that it tastes delicious. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for their unusual taste directions which beer, cheese, beef and gold foil belong to. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Nevertheless his newest creation is supposed to become even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> That is impossible at and for itself due to the refraction which is caused by the ice crystals which ice cream consists of; but I presume we find a possibility to create it. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that is made by Chinese scientist artificially </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Salem: Johanna Rahner during the Ecumenical Conversation Forum </seg>
<seg id="2440"> During the next Ecumenical conversation forum on Monday, 21st October, in the New museum of the castle it is a question of the topic &quot;To the hell with the hell - Theological considerations for the present contact with the last things&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Consultant is professor Johanna Rahner. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelic church municipalities Salem, the Salem castle&apos;s and the culture office&apos;s Lake Constance circle </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question today the people classify the &quot;last things&quot; after the death. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> The people would have known about that too much in the last centuries and backed on those pictures in this case from sky and hell &quot;that shape to today our ideas so is characterized the contemporary prophetic lesson of the hopes for completion rather through a certain embarrassment or quite Sprachlosigkeit. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;Christians were cured of the greater hope appropriately by the religion criticism says the consultant. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> She &quot;supplied us with so many question marks, that us the exclamation marks seem to have gotten lost. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Johanna Rahner passes on: &quot;Nevertheless the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of the death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The question about that longing &quot;which dreams about at the end everything liking to be good&quot; is combined with that. </seg>

<seg id="2475"> The group, the thousands of former Nortel patents has, an avalanche of complaints because of patent infringement against mobile manufacturers tired on Thursday, under that also Google, the enterprise that was outdone by Nortel during the insolvency auction from it </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Rockstar, the consortium which had bought the Nortel-patents for 4.5 billion United States dollars sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other enterprises because of patent infringements in front of the US district court in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> There is Rockstar in the community possession of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> Google is accused in seven cases of the patent infringement. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> The patents would affect technology that brings search keys words into correspondence in the Internet with relevant advertising so the complaint that Suchmaschinengeschäft hits the core of Googles with that. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Representative of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and skirt star were not immediately accessible </seg>
<seg id="2481"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobiles which work with Googles operating system Android which stands in sharp competition to the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In the year 2011 Google gave an initial commandment over 900 million dollars for the Nortel-patents. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Google increased his offer repeatedly and last offered 4.4 billion United States dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> After it was outdone by Rockstar near the Nortel-patents, Google Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion United States dollars, a business acquired, who from Motorolas library was also partially motivated at patents. </seg>

<seg id="2487"> Frankfurt parking fees are supposed to increase strongly </seg>
<seg id="2488"> Parking in Frankfurt could become soon sensitively more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The municipal council of the city discusses this morning about a presentation of traffic departmental head Stefan Majer (Greens Party). </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Accordingly the parking fees are supposed to be increased around 50 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> However not the prices are supposed to be begun an, but be shortened the time interval from parking meters and park appearance automats from 30 on 20 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> In December the Stadtverordnetenversammlung must still decide. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt does not hold that &quot;for any good idea&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> The park possibility immediately in front of the business is &quot;an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller authorized dealers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> The Germany traffic club thinks that a rise is &quot;absolutely adequate and actually for a long time overdue&quot; after two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> The public local traffic becomes also more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Oil price keeps on dropping apart from 96 USD per barrel </seg>
<seg id="2498"> The oil price kept on falling also on Friday after worries about a high offer overshadowed a report according to which the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China increases. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> The reference crude oil sort for deliveries in December had fallen at the late morning into Europe in the electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange about 14 cents on 96.24 USD per barrel. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The contract fell around 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a collapse of prices of 5.8 percent in October. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The big crude oil offer loaded the prices in the last weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The energy ministry of the USA declared on Wednesday the US offer increased last week barrel around 4.1 million. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In the course of five weeks barrel had climbed around 25 million the offer. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> However, on Friday there were references to stronger demand through two reports about an activity increase in the Chinese manufacturing. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> This indicates a consecutive recovery of the economy of China that growth had gone up onto 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it quarter had arrived above on the lowest state in two decades. </seg>

<seg id="2507"> The throw away society does not think </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere well, but sometime it is slow house. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Only: In the stomachs of the people on the co-driver and moving seat the hunger becomes noticeable. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Clear, for that one or the other cocktail or champagne likes to be responsible! </seg>
<seg id="2511"> What seems likely there, than to go to the next Drive-In gechillt in order to treat oneself on a small thing? </seg>
<seg id="2512"> I add, I am gladly with in this case, if it late at night and/or in the early morning goes onto the Fastfood-getting. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> A few chips, a coke, a Burger - and then nix as off home and into the bed! </seg>
<seg id="2514"> However, on the way home the obvious differences become noticeable between me and other hungrigen Disco-Gängern. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Because what one must lack, that one flings his Fastfood bags from the car window with constant regularity?! </seg>
<seg id="2516"> Paper bags thrown away are due particularly to the weekends at street edges and on parking places. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> &quot;Why?&quot; I ask to myself. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The people are too dumb, around the bags with home respektive to take up to the next garbage can? </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It is not only like this, that the paper stuff&apos;s the landscape verschandelt. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Bags already concealed traffic facilities as guardrails and activated accidents through that. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Said &quot;throw away society&quot; does not think about something like that, however, presumably she not even knows what means this word actually. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If one is in the evening more often on the way, first rakes with several people in the car, knows one, as a moving-bank after celebrated nights can look: Rags, bottles and other garbage pile up there. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Nevertheless there a few bags would form more or less also nix - unlike the street, where no one wants to stamp on the food residues of others. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> I see really already the day coming, at which the removing becomes too stupid to the cities and to municipalities - and have to demand the Fastfood chains for their bags pledge. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Milk and egg alternatives in the overview </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Vegane Ernährung requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Mashed Tofu with plant cream is for example a curd substitute. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> The vegetarian Federal Government to the Weltvegantag names further ones on 1st November. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The Germany vegetarian Federal Government suggests a series of veganen alternatives on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on 1st November: </seg>
<seg id="2530"> A good alternative to butter is pure plant margarine, Joghurt makes replace by soya yogurt. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Instead of milk can Soya-, be used oat, almond or rice milk. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Impact Cash Plant Cream replaces traditional whipped cream. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Also to eggs there are vegetable alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Half a crushed, ripe banana for example can replace an egg as binding agent in a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Also 50 grams of apple purée or a tablespoon of milled linseeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for that. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Doughs become loose instead of with egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> But also 50 grams of soya yogurt or Seidentofu can serve this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> According to information of the Vebu about 800 000 people eat currently in Germany vegan, therefore in that vegetable. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> A black box in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2540"> US American street planners are in search of a money source in order to repair the deteriorating highway-system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the instrumentation panel of every car. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices which record every driven kilometer and which information onto the authorities announce are central point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal states to rework the obsolete system for the financing of US American streets. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The usually rather boring field of the road planning provoked suddenly an intense debate with colored alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertäre allied with environmental groups and speak out for that, that the government use the small boxes for the write-out of the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – and be able to use the information then for the calculation of notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Tea Party is horrified. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American civil rights union (ACLU) is also most deeply worried and expresses a series of data protection objections. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> However, while one is not can agree on a procedure in the congress, several Federal states do not wait longer. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> You check currently how they can change in the course of the next ten years for a system with the driver per driven mile pay. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of motorists already tested the tachographs from which some are endowed with GPS-supervision. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> That is really a must for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> „It is not anything, that we will use only possibly&quot;, Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern California Assn, said. of Governments who plans a recording of the driven miles with all Californian motorists in the Federal state from 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The kind and manner as we pay these taxes will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology for that is there. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The initiative comes to a time since the highway trust is broke to Fund which is financed from the taxes which US Americans give at the petrol pump. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> However, in America as much is not refueled more as formerly. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars consume less gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not been increasing for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians do not dare with the case of high spirit prices also to lift the steering wheels only around a cent. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> „The gasoline tax is simply not future-capable&quot;, according to Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> His Federal state furnished 500 cars with tachographs with which a mile-based paying-system is supposed to be tested recent. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> „That represents the on a long-term basis most reasonable alternative&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee </seg>
<seg id="2562"> It does not surprise that urban liberals approve the idea, because the tax could be used for example dazu to influence the driving behavior so that jams and climate-harmful waste gases are reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Californian planners put on the system during the preparation from strategies with which the ambitious, by law anchored objectives of the Federal state for the climate change are supposed to be reached. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Nevertheless the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, also declared that he sees the most feasible long-term alternative in that. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Also the free ones Vermarkter of the Reason Foundation are caused from the idea to make drivers to covered stretch be paid. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> „That is not a tax which disappears in a black hole&quot;, declares Moore, vice-president, Adrian for guidelines at Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Paying the people directly for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is supported also by two former American Ministers of Transport that had asked in a report in the year 2011 the congress to move in direction of mile-based billing. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> The US senate approved last year a pilot project 90 million dollars expensive which would have contained 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Nevertheless the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and reacted in this way to the objections of representatives from rural fields which people represent who must often cover many miles in the everyday life on the way to the work or into the city. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Several Federal states and cities move nonetheless on own initiative in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Oregon, which recruits currently 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment of the country, is at the most engaged. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will pay soon the mile fees to the Federal state instead of the mineral oil tax. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada finished already a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York City considers also one like that. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois tests it in restricted measure with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I-95-Koalition which the traffic ministries belong to from 17 Federal states at the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines currently as one could introduce the change. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The draft is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were sceptical with the case of the thought the government could pursue each of their movements. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> „Objections against Big Brother and such things were a great problem&quot;, declares Alauddin Khan, conductor of the strategy and result management, in the traffic ministry of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on their web site: It would be relatively simple to change the tachographs into full-grown invigilators.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2583"> No necessity to establish a gigantic, unwieldy technological infrastructure which would be used unavoidably to entering data about the daily movements of individuals exists. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada does not belong to a row exactly from Federal states that stay now according to affordable technology look-out with which the state can capture the driven kilometers, however, when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> In this way, so khan, also the public would be more calmed. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The hunt according to this technology led some authorities to a small startup-enterprise by the name of True Mileage in californiums. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The company did not line up initially in order to help Federal states from motorists during the taxation. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Rather it was their aim of gripping in a rising market for Kfz insurances feet in the case of which drivers are supposed to pay on basis of the driven miles. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Nevertheless the devices tested by her are interesting also for the street planners because they do not work with GPS and only restricted information that are loaded regularly by modem deliver. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> „The people are rather ready to participate in that if their speed and locations are not recorded&quot;, declared Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> In some of these public pilot programs great errors were made. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to transplant this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon the planners experiment with giving motorists a series of choices. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> You keep yourself up for a device or without GPS decide. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or they do not choose at all any device and pay one instead of this flat rate on basis of the miles on the average driven by all inhabitants of the Federal state. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Other places hope for being able to sell the draft to a mistrustful public when they endow the devices with more functions when with wenigeren. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device into the taxation with which make pay also parking fees, an insurance must be paid only for driven kilometers and speed data are raised by other vehicles in real time thanks to which motorists can evade jams. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> „Motorists would be motivated to the participation by the added value of the advantages which the system offers&quot;, it is said in a planning document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Some traffic planners wonder however, whether the whole gossip is not only a gigantic diversion about the paying per mile. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the field of the San Francisco Bay officials declared, the congress can solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust find simple through rise of the fuel tax. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles which consume little gasoline so that also these pay a fair part. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> „There is not any reason for an operation if an aspirin also suffices&quot;, explains Randy Rentschler, the conductor for legislation and public matters of the commission. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists do themselves worry about their privacy and numerous other things. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Bath thin home: A dream becomes true for the FC </seg>
<seg id="2605"> At the importance for the city and the soccer club the official opening celebration did not pay for anything for the artificial turf sports ground in spite of the cold weather and the rain one. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> Presumably all had wanted a more pleasant ceremony on the last Saturday, however, Petrus did not want to play in this case. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> So all those had the checking, that came without umbrella or could not hold one like that for any reason. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> That went the musicians that framed the ceremonial act just the same as some speaker. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Also the FC chairperson Albrecht Schlenker who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream became wet therefore. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> His thanks were meant first and foremost for mayor Walter Klumpp that committed himself to the conversion of the project strongly, the district council, the shared enterprises and association members that brought in. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> Here completely especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> The rüstigen pensioners laid out 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Also the landtag State Parliament representative Karl Rombach acknowledged this remarkable honorary engagement. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Further greeting words spoke for the urban sport committee Hubert Baier, the district chairperson of the south Baden soccer association Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Mayor Klumpp brought into memory, that always again weather influences turning round in the spring and fall added the initial field so, that it could not be played on. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to the solution of the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of near the ground of the soccer club or near the secondary school at the saltworks lake. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> Both was rejected again. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Six years ago thoughts for the application of an artificial turf sports ground arose, which was regarded as the ultimative solution generally. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Concrete plannings were incorporated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube into heritage lease, a cost participation of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place accepted and the country promotion means of 104 000 euros approved. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> The district council concluded in October 2012 the takeover of the remaining 356 000 euros at the total costs of 560 000 euros, summarized Klumpp. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The start of building of the 68 times 108 meters of big artificial turf place occurred on 4th June. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> During the more than three months continuous construction phase 3000 cubic meters of earth were leveled from which half was used for the application of a Dirt-Bike-stretch </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Strangers hurt girls through shot from car </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Strangers hurt with the case of shots from a car a twelve year long one in Saxony-Anhalt. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The culprits had presumably lit with an air pressure arm at the Thursday evening in Genthin onto a group from children. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> That informed of the police in Burg. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The girl was hurt easily at the left calf. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> Rescue teams brought the girl into the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> The shot came from a small car which had driven past a group of six children and suddenly had stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> Witnesses saw two people being in the car. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The culprits in addition fired onto a bus stop. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> A disk broke. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Afterwards they went from that. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> The criminal investigation department investigates, it was said on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Snowden ready, „co-operate&quot; with Germany too with respect to US supervision </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US American secret service, declared it is ready to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag Federal Parliament if the American National Security Agency and their director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> The German representative Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this received asylum in order to discuss the statement with him in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> In a letter of Snowden which was presented to the media by Ströbele on Friday in Berlin this writes: „Even if the result of my efforts was nachweislich positive, my government keeps on handling a differing opinion as a faith break and attempts to kriminalisieren political opinion comment with punishment threat with the case of which no defense is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2639"> To say the truth is not, however, a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> In the letter Snowden writes it is convinced from that of the support of the international community being able to convince the American government of making the accusation against it fall. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> The accusation raised by the US Ministry of Justice covers espionage and theft of state property. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said Online opposite time: „If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we find then ways to facilitate that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2643"> The relationships between the USA and Germany are loaded by the claims the NSA listened to the mobile from chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Thomas Oppermann, the representative who guides the parliamentary committee, responsible for the secret service, declared one is supposed to seize the occasion to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible „without endangering it and completely ruining the relationships to the USA&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Ströbele, a representative of the greens Party, a picture of themselves and Snowden in his Twitter-Feed published. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> He was helped with his visit by two German journalists in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Declared to Ströbele, that according to the attorney of the former NSA employee Snowden not to Russia can return, if he leaves the country. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assertion then, that it is there „secure according to the representative. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Snowden declares in his letter that he would see himself exposed to a „serious and continuous&quot; pursuit campaign that marketed it from his home. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> It is, however, affected from the worldwide reaction to „my act of the political opinion comment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Citizens on the whole world as well as hochrangige politicians – also in the United States – referred to the disclosures as a merit about supervision covering an uncontrolled system at the general public </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In his letter Snowden makes an offer of the cooperation for the German authorities „if the difficulties were solved around the humanitarian situation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Security objections in Mozambique increase faced with collisions between influential personalities </seg>

<seg id="2657"> For two weeks there are almost daily reports about collisions between government strengths and Renamo which number among the worst combats since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Renamo was at one time a notorious rebel movement, that initially of the Rhodesia ruled over from white and later the Apartheitsregierung Südafrikas was supplementary in the bothering, to destabilize the independent government of the country. </seg>

<seg id="2855"> Nevertheless I hope for our winning also once again at last </seg>
<seg id="2856"> &quot;Because I white yes no more already at all as such a victory tastes&quot; Malmon expects a success experience of his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> Even if the third league reserve has currently not pulled out yet any trees of Fredenbeck, Malmon previously lifts the forefinger warningly. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> I myself trained many players still in the A-youth. </seg>
<seg id="2859"> Of therefore they motivate against their ex-coach surely completely especially. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> &quot;Furthermore it is to wait necessary, whether strengthening from the First in this case is still&quot;, the SG coach clarifies. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> In order to return to the success track at last again, the Malmon-team must increase itself in any case in comparison with the last appearances. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Nevertheless before all things in the cover work and during the switching game it last haperte tremendously. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Also the chance utilization must become definitively better. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> Therefore I hope for my players getting the head freely during the short pause at last </seg>

<seg id="2868"> Therefore he must be confronted in the USA with a punishment procedure, said the speaker of the US foreign ministry of State, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Also the recent comments of Snowden would not change anything at that. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Before the German greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to keep on threatening it with punishment </seg>

<seg id="2872"> Report: Obama-campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The narrowest consultants of president Barack Obama considered in secret to replace vice-president Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton in the election campaign 2012 so the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The disclosure is the most noteworthy surprise of the long expected work of marks of Halperin and John Heilemann about the election campaign 2012, „Down voice-dubs: Game Change 2012&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> There is a copy of the soon appearing Buchs for the Times and she told at the Thursday evening that the top consultants of the president „extensive group meetings and inquiries at the end of 2011 would have carried out in order to find out whether it looks for hope fading away to Obamas for re-election better if he makes Biden fall. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Say Jonathan Martin, national-political correspondent of the Times, paints in the book of employees of the campaign and the White House leading the history of the efforts thoroughly, in particular the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, measure, which effect it has exchanged onto the inquiry values the former exterior minister Clinton against the vice-president. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> The potential change was a severely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the oval Office </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Only half a dozen of the narrowest consultants of the president – including Daley, the former campaign conductor of Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading consultants of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the thought change answer. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> Is asserted in „Double Down&quot;, Daley stood at the top of the efforts to exchange Biden in spite of their „narrow, personal relation before one decided finally against such a move after the data showed the chances Obamas not to improve the candidacy of Clintons in a leading way would become. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> In an interview with Martin it confirmed Daley in replacing Biden by Clinton that in fact the government considered. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> „I expressed a whole series of things that one should take into consideration, and that was one „of them&quot;, Daley declared to the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> One must call oneself into memory, that the president had then dreadful inquiry values, therefore we thought: „For God&apos;s sake, what we do&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="2883"> While Daley was referring to the investigations as „offered care&quot;, it said to Martin opposite Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expenditure was invested in order to find out whether such a train is worthwhile with regard to the ballot boxes. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> „In campaigns as much money is not spent for inquiries and focus groups if one does not think about something seriously&quot;, declared Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> It is not, however, clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Martin said opposite CNN he asked Daley whether his former boss about the potential change would have known answer. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Although Daley declared he does not believe that the president of the possible change was conscious to himself, the former chief of staff admitted it was „possible&quot; that Obama knew about that. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Martin added, that „Down voice-dubs&quot; no definitive answer to the question whether the political sounding outs Obamas would have reached Schreibtisch delivers. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Co-opera asked Martin whether he thinks seriously Obama did not know about the investigations anything over whether one is supposed to make fall to Biden at the choices </seg>
<seg id="2890"> „Possibly&quot;, Martin replied. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> District council is pleased with sound budget </seg>
<seg id="2892"> Whenever it is a question of the budget in district council meetings mayor Ralph Gerster laughed well. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration does not know debts anymore already since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Also the financial year 2012 can be credited as full success in this sense. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> This became clear during the idea of the annual accounts for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> How Andrea Rothmund explained is the administration budget with about 7.6 million euros more than one millions of euros more highly unusual than planned. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Also the surplus of the administration house hold lies with about 1.8 million euros about one millions of euros above the approach. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> The surplus is to be owed to particularly higher trade tax gains and the municipality part of the income tax. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Also the property budget lay again clearly about the planned values. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros it was in the last year 2.5 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;This is due basically to the higher supply from the administration budget&quot;, according to Rothmund. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Since in the financial year 2012 less investments were made than plannedly, also the reserve supply turned out more highly. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> In total the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros on now in total 4.9 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for the good work </seg>
<seg id="2905"> &quot;One does simply not joggle such work from the sleeve&quot;, Gerster with look onto the annual accounts praised. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> It and the district councils were pleased with the good numbers visibly. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> It likes to ring paradoxical, nevertheless exactly these good numbers can the citizens soon to stand expensively come. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Through the good financial condition the municipality could renounce in the past high tax factors. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Through that in turn subsidies were already often shortened, however, by the country according to Gerster. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> For these subsidies from various compensation sticks there are conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Among other things the cities and municipalities which apply for subsidies must show certain tax factors. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> &quot;We must have a look at the topic tax factors since in the coming years investments wait for which we would have subsidies gladly&quot; announced Gerster in this connection </seg>
<seg id="2913"> Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics of the Small Hay Mountain confirm their creed during the confirmation </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In two church services 101 young people of the spiritual charge unit 15- and 16-year old are gefirmt At the Small Hay Mountain become. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> The group accompanied the church service on morning Laudato Si, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> With the reception of the skilled sacrament the youthful ones said yes with regard to their baptism and asked for the strength of the Holy Spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> The confirmands had prepared in the last months for the large high day of deacon of Pure Expanders and the assistance of numerous parishioners under the management </seg>

<seg id="2919"> Despair scream of an Obama-voter </seg>
<seg id="2920"> I elected president Obama twice in the hope for change being possible </seg>
<seg id="2921"> He says Obama undertook praiseworthy efforts which were foiled from the blockade tactics of the republicans </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The blockade politics does not excuse for the web site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Obamas memoirs about the election campaign 2008 are a sad memory of what would have been possible </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at that one Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> I read currently a dreadfully sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> It is a book from which I believed, it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medicine study and there would be again hope to me. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> „The Audacity to Win&quot; (Courage to win) is called and describes the memoirs of Barack Obamas for the premiership choice 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> If I am ready in the evening with my patient records and go to bed, the book takes me back then to a time, as the politics millions inspired and a talking the breath could rob. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> The choice became a landslide victory and newsreaders paused in order to make the historical importance of this hour clear. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all newspapers which they could find. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> A young team of visionaries was on the way into the White House and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> When changed then 2008 Obama into the office, he had approval values of 82 %. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> And then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Again a bad awakening is to be switched over to the present as if one is torn from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder onto missed possibilities. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In the years since I gave my voice for the first time something changed in fact. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But it is simply not anything what I could have imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I acknowledge the splendid and many-sided things that Obama reached from the discharge of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance up to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing Osama of bin Ladens. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> Also I think that the party-political blockade tactics tilted too many attempts with which our nation should be brought forward: To name immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, only around some. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> However after I have defended countless times the Obama government opposite colleagues and acquaintances, I arrived with my declaration attempts at the end </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The republican blockade politics cannot declare, for which one approves the sound monitoring of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children through drones overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It cannot be declared why the National Security Agency gathers data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower who disclose state error behavior are punished. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It cannot declare, for which Anwar al-Awlaki, a US American citizen, without procedures was murdered, still why the public financing and edition borders are avoided during the premiership choices </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It does not justify the results of a report in which it means the efforts of the White House to the quiet position of the media are the most „aggressive... since the Nixon government&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And recently it cannot excuse for the impotence, to project a simple web site in the more than three years since the discharge of the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I do not know whether it is what I should have expected. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding to her. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Obviously the representative office is not a foreseeable course since an opposition party and accidental events as the Newtown-massacre shape the public discussion. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> However if I have a look at the above-mentioned examples, then they seem elected by the government itself to a large extent his </seg>
<seg id="2951"> And that disturbs me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I chose in 2012 Obama again, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mitt Romney represented a confusing and immature alternative, it seemed not to be able to define his direction and positions. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> I had the impression a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices would fulfill the hope which we had heard about already for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> However with the sinking of the approval values for Obama on less than 45 % this week the return became the harder in the year 2008 through this book. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> It wakes in me the longing for the many promises which dissolved in Luft. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> This week I read a section in the book, that one describes as Obama had to take a difficult loss against Clinton with the case of the preselections in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> In a meeting with the election officers according to the decision he said to his employees they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their thing. </seg>

<seg id="2965"> Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle he noticed, that it was on the left-turning lane in direction Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed onto the right lane. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> At that it resulted in the collision with the BMW of a 23-year old Konstanzers driving there. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> Also the VW trade wind going behind the BMW of a 19-year long one was damaged. </seg>

<seg id="2971"> The citizens Pfullendorfs must prepare themselves for higher stream costs. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> As the manager of the city works Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed opposite the SOUTH COURIER, 70 to 90 euros of additional costs per annum come up to a four-headed Pfullendorfer family. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> The rise of the so-called EEG-apportionment of 5.277 is essential reason of the pending increase in prices on 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> This apportionment is set every year in October of the four operators again that of the big stream routes. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> These number the additional costs arising for them from the energy turn which can raise it through an apportionment about the electricity tariff. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> The supervisory board of the energy enterprise had taken even a higher apportionment as a basis in his predictions as Jörg-Arne Bias tells. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Now the concrete ones would have to pay be calculated before the city works could inform their customers of the exact increase in prices next week. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;We go from an increase from 1 cent plus x&quot;, so Bias which the number will rather be near near the 2 cents. </seg>

<seg id="2986"> In this case director Fresacher seems to trust in the text little. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> The 70-minute performance whitewashes the presentation with an abundance of direction ideas, confessed from the repertoire of postdramatic game forms. </seg>
