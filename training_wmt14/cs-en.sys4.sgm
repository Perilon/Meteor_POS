<seg id="247"> Frontier Airlines is planning to charge hand luggage </seg>
<seg id="248"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 during his years as the imposition of carry-on luggage on board. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Frontier Airlines is planning to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a cup of coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all the can. </seg>
<seg id="250"> The new fee for carry-on luggage is concerned at the top of the storage space, so a small bag under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="251"> The company says it will charge $25 Frontier, if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 if passengers will wait until the arrival of payment to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="252"> A spokesman for the company&apos;s Frontier Kate O&apos; Malleyová stated that stodolarový fee is to encourage passengers to take care of payment in advance. </seg>
<seg id="253"> &quot;do we pick the charge,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="254"> The airlines have begun to charge brought the first and second bags in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Passengers trying to avoid those fees and poured into carry-on bags hidden in the storage space, as best they could, so often lacking in this space instead. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The fees are one way to learn, to take on board took less things. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The &apos;Malleyová said that the purpose of this new fee is not actually get more money. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The point is that the company&apos;s most loyal customers Frontier is clearly expressed that to find a place in the top of the storage space is becoming increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers who bought tickets purchased on the company&apos;s website, they will not pay. </seg>
<seg id="260"> That is, that one passenger in line at the gate of the company Frontier may bring baggage, for which does not pay anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same baggage will pay $100. </seg>
<seg id="261"> The &apos;Malleyová said that Web pages and handling procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="262"> New Frontier&apos;s fee for carry-on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer, but the date has not been set. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but the airline&apos;s love. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Claims that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service, they should pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Many on Wall Street see other baggage fee as a sign that the airlines are trying to collect enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="266"> But most of the fees for carry-on luggage did. </seg>
<seg id="267"> The company Spirit Airlines as the first zpoplatnila hand luggage before three years ago and other low-cost Allegiant Air later followed her example. </seg>
<seg id="268"> The only company, which also has such charges, is Hungary&apos;s Wizz Air, said aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees. </seg>
<seg id="269"> In its report in December 2011 estimated that a fee for carry-on luggage Spirit will bring the company $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Sorensen, the former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit of companies and marveled at what he saw at the gate, when he met with an unusual fee of Spirit&apos;s carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="271"> &quot;boarding the smoothest, it was what I had ever seen in his aviation career,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I waited at the gate, I see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels. </seg>
<seg id="273"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the onset passed in an instant.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="274"> Frontier also makes the charges after the model of Spirit for coffee, tea, soda and juice. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Frontier said that passengers who will get a soda or juice, coffee may retain the can and will be free of charge full. </seg>
<seg id="276"> The water will continue to be given free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Us Airways tried briefly in 2008 to introduce fees for drinks, but after complaints from passengers about seven months later retreated and no other significant airline nenapodobila her. </seg>
<seg id="278"> The last move of Frontier charge of carry-on luggage, if a passenger nezakoupí years directly from the airline, is the latest attempt to steer customers directly to their Web sites. </seg>
<seg id="279"> The airlines are paying Internet travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 dollars for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="280"> It could all airlines initiative, to lead passengers to buy directly from them, the place to do it through online travel agencies. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The company Frontier, however, went furthest in this area. </seg>
<seg id="282"> In September she started to give customers who bought over the Internet travel agency, only half miles in the frequent flyer programme. </seg>
<seg id="283"> In the center of the ořízla remuneration for nalétané miles to 25 percent of miles out of the way. </seg>
<seg id="284"> So does the remuneration of the Frontier long journey of 1,000 miles purchased over the Internet travel agency 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Customers also allows the company to choose their seat in advance only in the event that the purchase will be carried out directly through the company&apos;s Web site Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="286"> The company Frontier has a loyal base of customers in his home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and is losing money. </seg>
<seg id="287"> According to the financial results referred to in the middle of a corporate partner of the Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity has shrunk by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Republic is trying to resolve the sale of the airline&apos;s financial problems of the company Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="289"> We studied 11 THOUSAND ads! </seg>
<seg id="290"> We know where you want to work! </seg>
<seg id="291"> In November of last year the analysis took over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 200 of them was published in the daily press and 6,800 (62 percent) ads on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="292"> The Internet is thus becomes the most important medium for the publication of job offers. </seg>
<seg id="293"> Yet in 2005, when the survey conducted for the first time, made his share of 26 percent. </seg>
<seg id="294"> In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) steadied at about 60 percent. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Advertising job opportunities in her analysis by largely reflects the current situation on the labour market. </seg>
<seg id="296"> An example of this may be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="297"> For example, in 2007, nearly 25 900 ads was published in the same period in 2012 was less than half that. </seg>
<seg id="298"> The posts on the Internet is oriented to closer, in particular, more qualified group of professions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> By contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those working-class, Pavlína Šťastnová introduced the author of the analysis. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The level of representation of the selected professional groups is different in the two media. </seg>
<seg id="301"> The front of the advertisements on the Internet in search of managers and executives, the trade representative, programmers and financial experts. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The position of hackers or small business leaders acted only on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="303"> The daily newspaper is significantly lower the proportion of these specialist professions, on the other hand, a large representation include in particular service and blue-collar professions. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Education, of course, are among the most commonly reported requirements that employers are expressed through advertising offer. </seg>
<seg id="305"> To further the areas of knowledge of foreign languages, especially English. </seg>
<seg id="306"> The daily newspaper on knowledge of a foreign language requirement has been placed in three percent of advertisements on the Internet at 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="307"> Only two percent of advertisements employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &apos;computer literacy&apos; claims appeared in 40 percent of the ads in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent). </seg>
<seg id="309"> The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements. </seg>
<seg id="310"> The requirements are generally associated with qualified professionals to practice. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The head of the production and other executives. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the working-class professions is mainly about the mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or the repair of electrical equipment, said study author George Tillner. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Employers also in the middle of their ads state requirements on the qualities and skills of potential bidders. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Like most skills, communication skills are appearing in advertisements for first place in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="315"> The employers want flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, accountability, organisational ability and reliability. </seg>
<seg id="316"> A fifth of shopping centres is struggling with low our attendance </seg>
<seg id="317"> According to data from estate consultancy company Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle. </seg>
<seg id="318"> In Prague Bohnicích Krakow Shopping Center opens to the public, will be 19 Prague shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="319"> In the Czech Republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers. </seg>
<seg id="320"> The disappointing performance concerns about 20 percent of medium and large centers. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The main problems are inappropriately large centre on the site and bad layouty, so too much floors or complicated and chaotic organisation passages, or dead space center,&quot; said Michael Sotak of company Cushman &amp; Wakefield. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Also according to the head of the department of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvia Samadi is dealing with our attendance low about a fifth of the trade center. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Among the main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of the local population or an overcapacity in the market in a given place. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were particularly disappointing at first. </seg>
<seg id="325"> Today the customers are somewhat conservative and don&apos;t like to change their shopping habits. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The new trade center must work harder to &apos;lure&apos; their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, service and marketing events,&quot; Samadi said. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The shopping center occupancy in Sotáka is generally stable, even in some of the centres to increase, because landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of rent and dopronajmout some units. </seg>
<seg id="328"> But the truth is that recently opened some of the projects, which are not fully occupied and reduce the average occupancy so (Breda &amp; Weinstein, for example in Opava Šantovka in Olomouc),&quot; Sotak said. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The trade center opened in the past two years to promote the market by Sylvia Samadi very slowly. </seg>
<seg id="330"> But there is room in the market for new projects. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The number of seats suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="332"> For example, in Prague, we see scope for the construction of the project, which would serve the people of Prague 6. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Certainly there is room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called &quot;convinience centres,&quot; aimed at daily purchases and services necessary for the population living in the immediate vicinity,&quot; Samadi said. </seg>
<seg id="334"> There is also under Sotáka on the domestic market place for other shopping centers. </seg>
<seg id="335"> And as for the little &apos;service&apos; center, so for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects or expand in regional cities. </seg>
<seg id="336"> &quot;city as Kladno, Czech Republic, Brno or Plzeň Sotak have room for further growth,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="337"> In Prague he sees room for the upcoming trade centre in Champion Square, according to him have a clear potential Na Prikope street and Wenceslas Square. </seg>
<seg id="338"> &quot;intensively expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover is developing and expanding into smaller and smaller cities for favorable rents and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or shopping centers, and the reconstruction of such as reconstruction of the sietch commercial home Prior, which benefit from good locations,&quot; she added Dita Kubánková of company DTZ. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In the Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross pronajímatelných areas. </seg>
<seg id="340"> A quarter of all these shopping center is located in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, stems from the company INCOMA GfK data. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The number of shopping parks in the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with those of Britain and France is lagging behind the Czech Republic about 50 square meters per thousand people. </seg>

<seg id="366"> Report: Obama&apos;s campaign considered replacing Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="367"> President Barack Obama&apos;s closest adviser, according to the New York Times newspaper, secretly considered to replace Hillary Clinton on the ticket of Vice President Joe Biden in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="368"> The revelation is the most important news impatiently expected of the book on the 2012 campaign from Mark Halperina and John Heilemanna &quot;Double down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="369"> The Times obtained a copy of the book and announced on Thursday evening that the president&apos;s top aides held at the end of the year 2011 intensive group meetings and opinion polls to gauge whether the waiver of the Biden, would help revive fading hopes in Obama&apos;s re-election. </seg>
<seg id="370"> According to národně-politického correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of leading officials in the campaign and in the White House, namely, former director of the office of the White House Bill Daleyho, to measure the effect on the election should tool|Move former Secretary of State Clinton for the post of vice-president. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The potential change was a closely-guarded secret in the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Only a few of the president&apos;s closest advisers - including Daleyho, former head of the Obama campaign Jim Messina and former main advisers in the White House of David Axelroda and David Plouffeho - knew that he is considering this change. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The book &quot;double down&quot; claims that Daley was a leader of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that in the meantime, before he finally decided to perform this move as data showed that adding Clinton on a ticket,&quot; Obama&apos;s chances would be substantially increased.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="374"> In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="375"> &quot;I&apos;m intensely examined a whole range of things, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley expressed for the sheet. </seg>
<seg id="376"> Don&apos;t forget that, at the time, the president had a chance, so we thought: &apos;Christ, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> While Daley described the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin said as a little boy Cooper of CNN, that the campaign for re-election has made considerable investments, to determine whether this move is worth in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="378"> &quot;during the campaign to interpret that kind of money on elections and qualitative research, if something really serious nezvažuje,&quot; Martin said on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="379"> However, it is not clear whether Obama knew about the fact that his team is considering this exchange. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Martin said on CNN that Daleyho asked whether his former boss knew about this potential shuffling cards. </seg>
<seg id="381"> While Daley said he does not think that the president had been aware of the potential changes&apos;,&quot; former office manager admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew about it. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Martin added that the book &quot;double down&quot; finally does not respond to the question of whether the political probe got up to Obama on the table. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Cooper asked Martin whether he really thought that Obama did not know about the research on the register Biden of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="384"> &quot;Maybe,&quot; Martin said. </seg>
<seg id="385"> So, no, sir Hašku. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We have a unique opportunity to say to the politicians, not that way. </seg>
<seg id="387"> It is necessary to develop such pressure to Martin Hašek was deprived of all political functions and left mandate. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so poor. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Martin zaštíťuje Hašek promise, which gave, but every policy and especially you must be aware of the consequences of the promise and very entertaining, what can promise. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Confidence is the only capital, which has policies (Mr Babiš has the physical, but the question is whether it is policies). </seg>
<seg id="391"> The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy. </seg>
<seg id="392"> In politics is no excuse, in politics, was stepping down. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Mr Hašku, if it is good with this country (and your frequent statements encourage me in that, if you just didn&apos;t lie - here, you can see how difficult it is to the lies), leave politics alone, like a man. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Then people will accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and has its responsibility for it. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Otherwise you will be perceived as a spineless wimp, whose words or deeds cannot be trusted. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Either you want to be proud, though erring human life or chicken. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Maybe it seems to you that it is unfair, when oslovuji only you, but you&apos;re the leader and they just misguided sheep. </seg>
<seg id="398"> And the leader of you and you&apos;ve always wanted to be. </seg>
<seg id="399"> I understand that he is now trying to lower the ears, redeploy vysedět shame and then attack again, but so are the guerrillas or podrazáci. </seg>
<seg id="400"> You, I repeat, the leader in their eyes, the alpha male, so they act. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Accept the responsibility and go away from politics. </seg>
<seg id="402"> The black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="403"> While American road planners struggling to find the money to repair crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, which is easily fits into the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The device, which monitor every mile, who travelled a motorist, and transmit that information to the authorities, are at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and offices for the state planning to renovate the outdated system of financing America&apos;s main roads. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Generally dull design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of a variety of associations. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for it, so that the government could use these small boxes, which would record the distance travelled and perhaps even that, where you&apos;re going - and then use this information to build a tax notice. </seg>
<seg id="407"> The tea party is terrified. </seg>
<seg id="408"> The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy. </seg>
<seg id="409"> And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states to expect nothing. </seg>
<seg id="410"> During the next decade, they may move to a system in which a driver pays for half a mile of the road, after which he was going. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Thousands of motorists had already black boxes, some of which are using GPS tracking, take to the test. </seg>
<seg id="412"> This is a real need for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="413"> It is not an issue, when we have the power to choose,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration for this state in southern California, which plans to launch the monitoring of vehicle kilometres in each of California motorists in 2025. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Changes to the way we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Use this technology to do so. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The incentive is the fact that Road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The Americans don&apos;t buy as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Cars travel more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen over the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians have also been reluctant to raise the tax on only a single cent. </seg>
<seg id="421"> &quot;gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy from the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars, to test the system of paying per kilometre driven. </seg>
<seg id="423"> &quot;It appears to be in the long term as the most logical alternative,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The experts call it a user fee by mileage. </seg>
<seg id="425"> It is no surprise that the urban liberals like this idea, because the tax can be used to change the behavior patterns of drivers, which, for example, can help to reduce traffic congestion and the creation of greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id="426"> California&apos;s designers look to this system in planning strategies, which are to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious laws on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But Bill Shuster, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also sees this as a long-term alternative nejfunkčnější. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The leaders of the free market of the Reason Foundation are also inclined towards the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled. </seg>
<seg id="429"> &quot;It is not a tax, which would disappear into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organisation of Reason. </seg>
<seg id="430"> People pay directly for what they receive. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The initiative also support the two former American transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to set off in the direction of paying for half a mile. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The US Senate last year approved a pilot project for $90 million, which should include about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="433"> The leadership of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and have done so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the components of the population whose daily life often means travel many miles to work outside the city. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Several states and cities, however, is moving forward on their own. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Most ardent in Oregon, which is the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="436"> These drivers will soon start to pay a tax to the state for the distance travelled, instead of the tax on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="438"> New York&apos;s project examines. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Illinois is trying to do this in a limited fashion in trucks. </seg>
<seg id="440"> A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 of the ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies, how can implement this change. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The concept is not just a champion. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In Nevada, where the device was recently about 50 cars equipped with volunteers, drivers were concerned by the fact that the government is able to follow their every move. </seg>
<seg id="443"> &quot;concerns regarding the monitoring of the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who leads management strategy and operations on officials of the Ministry of Transport. </seg>
<seg id="444"> It was not something that people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="445"> As the project went on, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on their website warned: &quot;It would be very easy to turn the device on a full tracking device.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="446"> It is not necessary to build a ponderous technological infrastructure, which will inevitably spread to the registration of day trips and the arrival of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an affordable technology, which would allow the state to keep track of how many miles the car hit, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="448"> If you can do it, said Khan, the public will be calmer. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to small companies in California named True Mileage (real the distance travelled). </seg>
<seg id="450"> The company originally into action to help the government was not involved in the taxation of drivers. </seg>
<seg id="451"> She wanted to break through in the emerging market with third-party liability insurance, where drivers would be paid on the basis of how much travel. </seg>
<seg id="452"> But this is testing the device, which attracts the attention of the planners of the road network, because only a limited amount of information that does not use GPS and supplies are regularly recorded using a modem. </seg>
<seg id="453"> &quot;People will be more willing to go, if nesledujete their speed and their location,&quot; says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A number of major errors appeared in some of these pilot programs. </seg>
<seg id="455"> They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In Oregon designers experimented with it, that they give drivers a choice. </seg>
<seg id="457"> They can choose the GPS device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Or you do not need to take any of the equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the people of the state. </seg>
<seg id="459"> In other places they hope to alert the public to the concept initiated, if the device will be able to more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the city of New York, transport officials trying to develop the device tax, which would be equipped to pay fees for parking hours, so that it was possible to provide insurance to kilometres travelled and that collected data on the rate of other drivers, so motorists can avoid a traffic jam. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,&quot; states the document projection of the city. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Some traffic engineers would, however, like to know whether any discussion of the payment per kilometre are not just a placeholder problem. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could solve the problem with zbankrotovaným road Trust Fund very simply by an increase in the gasoline tax. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Single or annual tax could be levied on the driver&apos;s hybrid or other cars, which many nespotřebují fuel, so they will pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;no radical surgery is needed, when is enough to take an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for legislation and public affairs. </seg>
<seg id="466"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about privacy and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="467"> With a billionaire will next year on the phone? </seg>
<seg id="468"> Kellner, owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the mobile operator O2. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The two companies confirmed the talks, according to various sources of agencies, from behind the scenes, says he had a hand in the hole. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The announcement of the transaction should come back in November, probably before the start of the auction spectrum for LTE network, that is, before 11 November. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Karel Komarek Kellnerův competitor KKCG own group. </seg>
<seg id="472"> That is the mark of Sazka Telecommunications dropped to auction spectrum for LTE network. </seg>
<seg id="473"> To everyone&apos;s surprise, and that in the meantime the taste of firms to penetrate into telecommunications was not mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="474"> But the Sazka now leads a very experienced telecommunications veteran Robert Chvatal. </seg>
<seg id="475"> He started as a marketing chief of RadioMobil (today T-Mobile), eventually became the director of the Slovak T-Mobilu and last in charge of the Austrian branch of the same operator. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Sazka plays a few cards at once. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Bid in the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for Vodafone virtuála. </seg>
<seg id="478"> And it makes sense. </seg>
<seg id="479"> If he succeeds in an auction, so the network will be able to move into their existing customers from its virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="480"> It would be like under normal circumstances like Vodafone, but according to information of Hospodářské noviny that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Vodafone currently suffer by competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who are completely to share their networks. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Vodafone so he needs a partner. </seg>
<seg id="483"> And that may be just Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="484"> If that succeeds in the tender for the LTE network (as a rookie can spectrum auction specially designed), as Vodafone&apos;s auction may not go at all, or he won&apos;t mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (frequency is not enough for all). </seg>
<seg id="485"> Vodafone, namely the Sazkou can share the network. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Vodafone drops Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or newly built LTE network to 900 MHz frequency), thus enabling the company a quick start of the network. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Sazka in between starts to build costly LTE network, which will be able to use and Vodafone. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The two companies may be happy with. </seg>
<seg id="489"> The money saved would then Vodafone could spend some solid Internet providers or cable television. </seg>
<seg id="490"> And Kellner? </seg>
<seg id="491"> That would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately won a full operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services. </seg>
<seg id="492"> But on the other hand, it&apos;s a big juggernaut, which will wait for the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="493"> In an auction would receive the LTE network Kellner even in the O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobilem. </seg>
<seg id="494"> The two companies already had declared that the network will share. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The auction might finally be a success, but probably not enough with huge sums of money to enjoy the state budget. </seg>
<seg id="496"> And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic could choose between the call with Vodafone T-Mobilem Kellnerem or Komárkem. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Or the two titans of the Czech business against global giants. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="499"> Environmental activists held in Russia since September to protest against planned production of oil in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg. </seg>

<seg id="501"> She also claims that the original charge of its activists of piracy has been withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="502"> &quot;Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources, that thirty men and women, pent-up in Russia for non-violent action against the oil platform in the Arctic, were transported from the detention centre in Murmansk to the prison in St. Petersburg,&quot; the organization said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="503"> The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear, according to DPA agency was concerned about the planned move. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Environmentalists authorities first accused of piracy, which threatened them in the event of a conviction for up to 15 years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="505"> But last week announced that this charge will be replaced by softer výtržnictvím, for which there is less of a sentence with an upper limit of seven years imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Greenpeace but in today&apos;s statement noted that the charges of piracy, the authorities have tactical and engineering assistance, as promised. </seg>
<seg id="507"> This means that the detention are now charged with two crimes, he said. </seg>
<seg id="508"> The powerful Committee for investigation announced last week that the charge of piracy will replace the charge of hooliganism. </seg>
<seg id="509"> But thirty prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the charge was withdrawn from piracy. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Instead of against any new allegations have been raised,&quot; AFP quoted from a statement by Greenpeace. </seg>
<seg id="511"> The Russians had been detained in Gazprom&apos;s oil platforms in the middle of September three dozens of members of the Greenpeace movement originating from 18 countries. </seg>

<seg id="534"> During an earlier hearing he admitted to possession of cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="535"> The lawyer&apos;s fall came after Scarborougha police investigation found that he was in February 2011 in regular phone contact with Dittou. </seg>
<seg id="536"> Two detectives suspect tracked, recorded his arrival to Dittova house and saw him placed the drugs about 60 percent below the lawyer&apos;s pure trash in the black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="537"> He was subsequently Scarborough Dittou, who was at the dinner at the football stadium with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, in a telephone interview. </seg>

<seg id="541"> During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to get a few of her credit cards, but all were detained and were his hair samples. </seg>
<seg id="542"> During police questioning, he said that his office at his home address in the workplace, and that clients because of labor affairs visited him at home as well. </seg>

<seg id="564"> After a wave of criticism of President Obama yesterday backed away from his often repeated and ambitious promise, that &quot;if you like your health program, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> With reference to the hundreds of thousands of notification of testimonies from providers Republicans in recent days accused the president of misleading the American public. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Yesterday, Obama flinched from its original promise. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;the vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance, you can keep it,&quot; he said in his speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="568"> With regard to what he called the &quot;rumors in the media,&quot; the testimonies, Obama called on Americans who received the notification to the search for new policies on the market. </seg>
<seg id="569"> The majority of the people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even less than expected. </seg>
<seg id="570"> You&apos;ll get a better offer,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="571"> His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population, which buy insurance for itself, may be forced to change the program, because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on the care available. </seg>
<seg id="572"> &quot;I say that these Americans on the plane: You deserve something better,&quot; Sebelius said in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington. </seg>

<seg id="579"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care to the villages in Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Bwelle and his team treated almost every weekend hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="581"> In the countries of West Africa is not too many doctors; only one in 5,000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Vote here or via their mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major candidates on the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="584"> In the competition for the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013, you can vote for him or for any of the 10 major candidates. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The winner will receive $250,000, so that he could continue his extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="586"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father has deteriorated again and again into unconsciousness and go to hospitals, which were not equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car crash near the capital city of Yaounde, Cameroon, in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="588"> First he treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that has spread to the brain, and there a hematoma, which caused him problems throughout his life. </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;in Cameroon were no neurosurgeons,&quot; says Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="590"> We had to take him out of Cameroon, if we had the money. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Instead, Bwelle spent years by his father ferried into the crowded clinics and hospitals, where he had received such treatment, which was just available. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="593"> You can get out of the house at five in the morning rush to the hospital, you were there first, but not the first. </seg>
<seg id="594"> There are many patients. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Some people die just because you have to wait. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Since 2002, when Bwelleho father died, the situation hasn&apos;t changed much. </seg>
<seg id="597"> According to the World Health Organisation in Cameroon is only one doctor for 5,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Just for comparison, the ratio is one doctor at 413 people in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="599"> And even if the doctor could visit the Cameroonians, many could not afford it. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private. </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;The only problem is poverty, which they have,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Because of poverty, she cannot take her life. </seg>
<seg id="603"> When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted last year for free 700 operations. </seg>
<seg id="605"> He became a doctor cardiovascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="606"> And he founded the non-profit organisation ASCOVIME, whose members at the weekend visit rural areas, where they provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Since 2008, his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people napěchuje supply to be attached to the roof of medical supplies and travel rough terrain to the villages, which are in need of help. </seg>
<seg id="609"> It is not always accompanied by luck. </seg>
<seg id="610"> More than once, the vehicle must push through the water and mud. </seg>
<seg id="611"> But when they arrive, they will welcome as the real heroes: The feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, which a community can offer. </seg>
<seg id="612"> In the villages of free medical care is really the reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - are very willing to engage local merriment. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The next day the team starts to treat hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="614"> &quot;on every trip we have 500 patients,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot. </seg>
<seg id="616"> During each of these weekends doctors provide different medical assistance. </seg>
<seg id="617"> Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, and diseases parazitními sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Others may get the crutches or donated glasses or birth certificate for free - the document, which calls for the school, but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="619"> In the evening the team is under local anaesthetics a simple operation. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The operation is usually do in the school building in the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes into zotavovacího points, to relax for the next patient. </seg>
<seg id="621"> By means of light from a generator, the operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work in the early morning hours. </seg>
<seg id="622"> It&apos;s exhausting, but village musicians usually the team&apos;s help, to maintain his motivation. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;us to stay up all night and continued their work, play the drums,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="624"> On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of his work. </seg>

<seg id="874"> As well as the spread of this festival, extended the world of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="875"> A number of comedians participating in this year&apos;s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as television or radio show in smaller companies, such as FX, Comedy Central and Spike. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Nick Kroll climbed to his sitkomem (cheerfully piquant &quot;League&quot; to the topic on FXX fantasticko-fotbalové) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central station. </seg>

<seg id="890"> Senator Dienstbier is consistent and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has prevented most interview on television. </seg>
<seg id="891"> On the basis of that, I don&apos;t see a better option than to ČSSD proposed for the PM deputy Senate Gajdůškovou, the only one would have an initial handicap and I think I would have done the standard of performance. </seg>
<seg id="892"> This is as good a solution that will support him as someone from the leadership. </seg>
<seg id="893"> I might add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and the parties continue without rupturing. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Alena Gajdůšková would be able to form a minority government with just a blessing from the Chairman of Babiše without fear and without people, but with lidoveckým Hovorkou health minister, who is, in fact, the faithful of a social democrat. </seg>

<seg id="1052"> Aircraft makers argue about the width of the seats at stake are large contracts </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft was unveiled a dispute about the width of the seats in the second grade for flights over long distances, which this month gave the cause of the bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The subject of the dispute is granted the width of seats on long-haul flights for economy class - not just the one would usually preceded the airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to claims on efficiency at the last aircraft offered by Boeing and Airbus SAS. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> The company Airbus this week called for industry standards, which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but the main American rival Boeing says airlines should decide about it. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of its two-engined long-range aircraft with the potential of a record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> So, how is the rear part of the plane disintegrated - especially if it is next to each other - 9 or 10 seats, is the basis of economic performance of &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; proposals for new aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> The company Boeing 777X says that the improved model,&quot; &quot;delivers 406 people in economic a breadth of more than 43 cm spread after 10 seats in each row. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The company Airbus says competing versions of the A350 model delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread after 9. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The giant aircraft are often attack each other in the technical issues through ads in the professional media. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Recently provisionally showed what may be the start of a new advertising war, when financiers showed a picture showing three people in the restaurant with the headline &quot;They would you like it?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1063"> &quot;Boeing promotes long-distance flights in the seats closer than they are in regional turbo-prop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> As the amended návky, people are eating more, but the seats on planes have radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, according to data from the Ministry of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 years, the US has increased by 10 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> According to the American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century over 100 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Airbus contends that his rival is holding the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of new pokřtěného aircraft was lower. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> The company Airbus claims that carried out the research, which suggests that the extension of the seat of 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> Boeing rejects the dimensions of the seats of the Airbus company and says that it is not in the powers of the aircraft manufacturers to decide on how airlines exports fees and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The company also says research shows that experience in the cabin depend on more than just the width of the seat. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> &quot;really going for it, to provide the flexibility to airlines and allow them to carry out the things they are convinced that they have to do to be successful,&quot; said an expert on the cab area of Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> They don&apos;t want to dictate to them what brings them a profit. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> More space for passengers is essential for his elbows, but for the vendor is a growing problem, which can affect yields. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> For this dispute is the race with an estimated trade in the coming decades in aircraft orders worth at least $700 billion at catalogue prices, enough to tip the balance of the American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> As Reuters reported in July, the distribution of seats is what drives the battle between the last aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Both Airbus and Boeing claims that are in their most recent proposals twin-engine long-haul aircraft about 20 percent better performance than the market leader in this segment, a model of the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The performance claims Boeing 777X model design depends in part on a comparison with 10 seats in the series and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Profit in the unit costs compared with 10sedadlovému concept is weakened. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> &quot;why that Boeing is doing, is home to more seats, and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, Airbus chief for the convenience of passengers in the company for Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> On the other hand, analysts say, that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in accordance with the fact that many of the passengers is for thicker layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fees. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> &quot;Forty five inches wide seat for passengers would have been great, but the reality is that, from a business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 model,&quot; said Mary Kirby, an expert on the interior of the cabin, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network portal. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Airbus and Boeing do not supply the seat, but the airlines are offering a catalog of suppliers, to be able to choose. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Scestovalí aircraft sellers even carry measurement of the zone to check the competitive arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> While wearing comfort, all producers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travelers. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> Airbus is offering the A350 model with 10 seats in the series, but says it still sold. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Until recently offered for some of its aircraft, Airbus emphasized the need for greater regulation of the cabin that wider seats in the aisles. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Experts say that without the support of only one other producer of large modern aircraft call for new industry standards they will remain, but may deter them from the waves of the sale of the 777X. </seg>

<seg id="1095"> The work that comes almost a quarter of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> The company is part of CME CET 21, which holds the license for broadcast television station Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, shopping, the TV and the Czech version of MTV music station. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> How much they touch the economies of the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the national television one TV Nova, is not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> &quot;It is premature and we can&apos;t really comment on that,&quot; said the director of communications New Phonetic|Juliet Koukolíček. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> According to the information she cannot avoid significant layoffs of the Czech Republic will of MF DNES, but by far the greatest impact that would have on staffing levels of branches of CME in Romania and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> The two new bosses New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who climbed after lengthy director Adrian Sarbuovi during Wednesday&apos;s conference call with analysts have talked about it, that they want to limit all activities that are not directly linked to the television business. </seg>

<seg id="1104"> The group, which owns thousands of the defunct company Nortel patents, filed suit on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including the company&apos;s Google, the company that přelicitovala at auction in the framework of the bankruptcy of a company Nortel. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> A consortium Rockstar, which purchased the company Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, zažalovalo in US District Court in Texas Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> The company Rockstar is in joint ownership of companies, Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Nokia and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Google is accused of breach of the seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> The patents include technology, which helps Doctor|Cold search terms on the Internet with the relevant advertising, states that the action, which is the core search business to Google. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Samsung, HTC, Huawei and Rockstar representatives were not immediately available. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Samsung, HTC and Huawei produce phones that run on Google&apos;s Android operating system, which competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> In 2011 Google made the default price offer of $900 million for Nortel&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Google has increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> After being defeated in the battle for the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google earned $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, which trade was motivated in part by a group of Motorola&apos;s patents. </seg>

<seg id="1116"> George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots on the selection </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Another day, another ghost story on independence. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> This time appears warning that an independent Scotland is a condition for membership in the EU would be his entry into the Schengen area. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> It gave the cause to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire fence along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as might be expected, it did not translate into newspaper headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> They also mentioned that the EU Member States spends much time by adapting their own laws, if it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the continued non-compliance would be cheap for Brussels concession in return for anything from Scots really want. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> So it&apos;s pretty weak story. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> And, in addition, so old that it has become a fossil. The canard that &quot;independence means passport control,&quot; I heard at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Yet the bearded in this story is an interesting idea. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Why shouldn&apos;t be expected, that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Why change London&apos;s yoke for the Brussels, particularly now? </seg>
<seg id="1128"> This is a real European story: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> The influence of the crisis of the euro is the so-called Project Europe officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Across Europe, the influence of the party of opposition to the EU or the euro as a common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Even in Germany, Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - based in this year - came out of nowhere and they capture nearly five million votes in September&apos;s federal election, which essentially &quot;sweep&quot; the Free Democrats in the Bundestag (equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats). </seg>
<seg id="1132"> On home soil was always the opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The current economic crisis, however, has become a decisive moment. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the jacket navléknutou on the national economy by adhering to the common currency project have led many people to think that Europe had gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> Rather, it is a system of the euro, which blocks their members to exchange rates favorable for German exporters - and German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency&apos;s southern Europe in domestic production of a disadvantage compared to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> Only by cutting public spending and revenue -- to which encourages Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For the current problems with the budget and currency is deeper cause European languid performance. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry is twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than it is in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> This is paralyzing the disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Not all the freezing salaries in the world would have forced the European petrochemical industry zadupání cheap oil slate from the US. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> The result is a smoldering rebellion, particularly in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that Germany will be held in check and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> Berlin and Paris as the card doesn&apos;t need political legitimacy and pushed for its own economic policy in Europe and worn the French economy to fend for itself. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> The result: The National Front of Marine Le Pen, anti-European right wing, had just won an additional choice and subjugated the ruling Socialists in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> The line is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - an early warning to the British Labor, that they cannot conclude that the split of the right to automatically positive effect on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> As Le Pen disposes of its newfound popularity among the white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The European elections next year would like to use it to create the anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If they will do well in the elections of the anti-European party, which is likely, he can dominate a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> I can think of that in the foreseeable future is growing anti-European feeling and attitude would kill to unite against the common currency, the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> The EU will not disappear, but rather transformed into something less rigorous (sovereign) within the meaning of the &quot;Europe of Nations,&quot; already favored General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Several of Germany and its satellite economies may have left the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I expect that the United Kingdom is from this project will go the distance and come to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to atlantickému cold. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And where will Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> We can choose to be areas (basically) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Or we can defend their own economic interests - in that era and the possibility to Berlin and Brussels, where we have to be. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I suppose that Scotland would have fared well in the loose arrangement of Europe provided that would preserve its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in nefederální Europe of the Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Otherwise we should take an example from Norway and to maintain their economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> The SNP government in Scotland - oddly - is the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition stance against planned cuts to (and implement) Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence because only now, to adopt austerity measures laid down by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> The parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate gender.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Germany became the first European nation, which recognises the third gender in children born with ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> The newborn children will no longer be ranked only either a male or female gender. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The new law from parents is not required to provide for such children either sex, and allows them to their birth gender sheets of paper as &quot;vague&quot; or &quot;unspecified.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1168"> The aim of the law is to stop pushing for parents that their child rashly decided for the operation in order to determine the sex, and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersexuální. </seg>

<seg id="1173"> Intersexuální could be Wallis Simpson. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States said it could not be determined if sex, it is better to use the best available information and identify them, instead of waiting and watching until the child&apos;s psychological and physical development operations are carried out, if at all. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist who specializes in the problems with the designation of the sex, he said, that the new German law &quot;looks like a good thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Intersexuální children pose ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> &quot;Some people are in life-threatening condition, which requires an operation, but for most children, that is not the case,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Sex determination can be made without the operation and then they can wait, how identity is evolving. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> The knowledge of how to work out for the child&apos;s gender is not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> No one can answer the question, why is this happening. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> It is a mystery why some people are homosexuals. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> The report described the European Committee passed in 2011 intersexuální people as different from transgenderových or transgender people, because of their status is not bound to sex, but on their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and it cannot be clearly defined as not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> These features can occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, the hairline, breasts and figure in the primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and the genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> The report also provides an overview of discrimination, which is experiencing intersexuální and transsexual people working in the field, and also the level of harassment, violence and prejudice. </seg>

<seg id="1189"> In neighboring France France 24, according to news reports on the issue of sex is still controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Dozens of French legislators in 2011 from this strongly Catholic countries have signed a petition to the &quot;gender theory&quot; was removed from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> America&apos;s website and online is against German law also define and wrote: &quot;with the way the world is scraped to a new state, where sex is not a matter of choice, but sexual activity, převracíme inside out two other pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1192"> One mother of an infant from Maryland for Baby zone, also said that he would prefer to see that children have allocated gender at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> &quot;parenting itself is stressful and without further restrictions, especially if you don&apos;t know the sex of their child,&quot; said the Web pages on parental care. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Historically, the children with both male and female sex called hermafrodité, according to the handsome River, who had dual gender. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> About ten years ago, the medical community and thought that sex is something like a table, which can erase and redraw again. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> But now many are questioning the ethical basis operation with it, may decide that gender is a complex issue and doctors incorrectly, because they don&apos;t know how, because of their gender, children will feel when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> &quot;in the middle of the 20th century was called the psychiatric emergency room,&quot; Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> When the children were born, you call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> The prevailing theory about how to deal with children with ambiguous gender, was presented to Dr. John Moneyem at Johns Hopkins, who took the view that sex is soft. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> It has created a new concept of &quot;sex&quot; and arguing that the social causes and environmental influences - both parents raised their child - acted on a child&apos;s genes and hormones and shaped regardless of whether the child was identified as a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> But in one case of 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan&quot; with his theory has become controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of poorly made obřízce, recommended that their child had been left completely castrated, removed his testicles and it was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> &quot;Media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different,&quot; Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> When the boy was 15 years old, left the přeoperovat back at the boy and married to a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 38 years, however, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Drescher said, that some doctors use this model&quot; to this day. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations have discovered &quot;unhappy with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1209"> This was the case with Jim Bruce, 36letého writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but the ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> The doctors were not sure whether it has a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that a man could never live &quot;satisfactory life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1211"> And so shortly after his birth in 1976 were Bruce surgically removed the bodies and balls and was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> In the 12 years he got the female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> &quot;I knew that I was not a girl,&quot; said for ABCNews.com. </seg>

<seg id="1225"> We&apos;re afraid it bids for intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> We believe that it is better to allocate male or female gender and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But we don&apos;t know how the law eventually lead, so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Tamar-Mattisová said that her organization supports Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults choose to be included in the third gender.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1238"> Although it is barren, hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> &quot;The law gives parents some room for its decision to take their time,&quot; said Baratzová. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It gives them time to perform certain tests and change his mind and give them this time than they write &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In this respect is all right - his child raising and love it. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> You have wonderful child and glad of it. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> You don&apos;t have to hurry with the operation, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;It brings the possibility to participate in decision-making, as well as a child and withdrawing the anxiety that parents are constrained, because they do not have the assurance that they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>

<seg id="1308"> Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for having assembled the explosive device, which was used in the bombing. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> For 15 years he could be paroled. </seg>

<seg id="1312"> The prosecution has demanded a life sentence, although it could insist that the man with the nickname &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (bourač) thanks to her professional reputation for the production of explosives was given the death penalty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> This decision revived painful memories of June Corteenové, the mother of Perth, which in a devastating attack run Patekem and other osnovateli almost a decade ago lost their 39letá twins Jane and Jenny. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> With tears in her eyes, she said, that Patek should be sentenced to death. </seg>

<seg id="1322"> This guy should get the death penalty as one. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it just isn&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Get 20 years for this, that killed 202 people and wounded hundreds of others, is not all that much. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Patek stood before the court as the last of the Bali bombers. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The arrest avoided almost ten years, but in the end he was captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed a former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports have revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden and al-Qaeda in an attempt to re-establish the link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia. </seg>

<seg id="1342"> Konzistorium next year will be significant, because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> At the moment is a certain orientation to Europe, and Europe, in particular, Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> It will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world, to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Forty percent of Roman Catholics is in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Phonetic|Foxtrot appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which gave the task to find ways to reform the Church. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In the past the pope ruled all for himself. </seg>

<seg id="1349"> He said that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the cardinals, the pope asks for advice. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> In this situation, but we weren&apos;t before - it&apos;s the sheer novelty. </seg>

<seg id="1376"> The Israelis demonstrated exactly how it should look like the bombing of Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Without undue noise, threats and million of the statement sent the aircraft, you hit the target and returned. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Without the left idle official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> All the action and refused to confirm the announcement. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The exact opposite confused and unsupported mall, acts of Obama&apos;s Syria policy. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> And most satisfying in its attack was what the Israelis bombed. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Don&apos;t be fooled by the media to their claims that had been bombed Syrian base&quot; or &quot;supply for hizbaláh.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1383"> I recently wrote about it here, that while US aid secular rebels in the country remains on a rhetorical level, so Russia merrily on supplying weapons to Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> And that the fresh supply of Russian rockets landed in the port Latákija became the target of the Israeli raid. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The clear message. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> And note, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although it according to the popular Internet theory should be the other way around. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The US government malfunctioning 2 spaciálních units, probably the Delta Force members. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> He didn&apos;t know until now that will distinguish themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A heroic death of two former member of the SEALs, who defended the CIA is known in the city, according to me they were members of the secret commandos of the CIA, which is made up of former soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> For a long time to speculate what they did the SEALs on the consulate or even in the CIA&apos;s residence located elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Now it is clearer. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In any case, the information that the CIA has protected offices in Libya kulometnými nests (just to one that both members of the SEALs were killed after a mortar), is quite surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> They were part of the American commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi voluntarily come forward to intervene, together with five private kontraktory coming his way to the site of the CIA in Benghazi. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The Obama administration Itself fact that during the attack, it was not officially deployed and the whole squad and that was just hesitant about what to do. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The squad leader, so without orders to release these volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> In any case it, that the country is not in a lump sum, but permanent American commandos, CIA agents and private kontraktoři is quite interesting information. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> And that in view of the fact that, until recently, officially admitted anything like this and I are now talking about some advice to the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> But it&apos;s good that the US as well as measures to combat terrorism in Libya. </seg>

<seg id="1402"> Not so long ago, what the media almost opěvovala Iranian air force for the prosecution of American drones. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Little is known, however, how the Americans their drones effectively protects. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Of course, if they can find its drone in the airspace, you can&apos;t do anything about it. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> If the Iranians drone in international airspace is discovered, however, the situation is quite different. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> And that has happened, that the Iranian aircraft chased the F-4 Phantom American drone in international airspace over the Sea, which was perhaps the first deployment of American super sharp F-22 Raptor fighter in history. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The pulling Phantoma to visually checked his equipment, without him Phantom registered on the radar or just noticed it and then when it suddenly appeared with him and invited the Iranian pilot to return home, he did so without complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> No wonder when Phantom is the American production, which, however, remembers the war in Vietnam. </seg>

<seg id="1415"> The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday requested a postponement. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The appeals court said the judge must be withdrawn from the case, because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, and that a judge acted in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public comments, which openly responded to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics as part of its programme of stop and search people. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Set up an independent supervision, to oversee the changes, including reforms in the procedures, training and supervision, and ordered to run a pilot program to test the cameras worn on the body in some areas where there are the most common stopping people. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In August, the city of New York agreed the storage methods of names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The appeal of the city are scheduled for oral arguments sometime after March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> The tactic of stopping and frisking people criticized a number of civil rights activists </seg>

<seg id="1428"> In the center of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of pediatric allergy to food in school. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> This is the first set of such directives issued by the US government, and that because of that, the number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies, to increase. </seg>

<seg id="1434"> The state legislature recently updated rules that allow schools to store the adrenaline easier. </seg>

<seg id="1437"> As the Tipsport (not) erasing personal data. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> More than a year ago, I did in the Tipsport.cz registration. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> I&apos;m here but subsequently finished, because someone just sat at the branch, who couldn&apos;t complete the registration of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> And because I didn&apos;t want to go to another branch of the registration fell, then I moved and it has changed my address and the number of card. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I can&apos;t do that, because I have another identity card number, address and that it&apos;s not just finish and that I have to ask for the deletion of the data and make a new registration. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> What I did and I 24.10.2013 wrote to the technical support that I am asking for the removal of all of your personal data from the database under existing law on the protection of personal data. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> On this day duhý wrote me technical support that I have to complete the registration at the branch. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The marathon began e-mailing for technical support, where, in the end, after 4 urganci 25.10. wrote that the personal data on my request erased. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> A man would, therefore, he said, that could make the new registration and began here again the problems as soon as possible, wrote to me that my user name is already busy (understand was deleted - this is not a personal data, but they also this). </seg>
<seg id="1446"> So I used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal data are stored, to complete the registration at the branch (as they may have saved something argues that erased?), so I contacted the technical support again. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> To my question how is it possible for me to be written, that personal data actually erased 25.10. and to send e-mail with the mistake. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> I did this (around 15 hours) yesterday and today, I replied that I was registered on the same day (31.10.2013) in 13.22 and that is why I can&apos;t do that, because I used the same name and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> What about that contact technical support for a week and then with them that it still can&apos;t. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> And what about that if it was true what (is not like) says no one would be able to register with the same name and the same birth date if this is already registered. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> Just by the way I was actually registered in the 13.22, on the same name and date of birth, but I used fictitious e-mail and telephone number and wonders, appeared to me for the moment that they sent me to e-mail a link to complete the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> How is it possible, as they could not be registered in the same name and date of birth? </seg>
<seg id="1453"> Probably because the Tipsport tied the registration to e-mail and phone number and date simply has not surrendered as saying. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So again I told this to technical support that simply lie (either intentionally or they don&apos;t know what they write), because that&apos;s what writing is not true. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> I added a few screens that the problem with the registration was &quot;false&quot; 31.10. so registering at this simply does not have the effect. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> To me it Tipsport wrote the stark sentence - I&apos;m sorry, but that you have already registered again, we cannot check your claim. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> And communication ended. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> And repeated over and over the same sentence, that is tied to the name and date of birth registration. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> They can&apos;t even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and that, in fact, neither has taken place. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> If it gets sorted out, not only that the Tipsport not data as they claim, but still is lying when he claims to the contrary. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> The worse is that it can be easily, as they lie, and trying to make it appear that the fault is on the side of the customer. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> By the way, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, set in motion a little things and e-mail came from the Technical aid that the matter be forwarded for review and will be informed (urgencí and after a week of wrangling and warnings on the same mistake). </seg>

<seg id="1490"> We use a protein, which in ice cream, reacts with your language at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> So how your mouth protein heat, increases the pH levels and ice cream begins to glow. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> We tested it in the last couple of months and it seems to be a great idea for the celebration of Halloween, because it causes this fantastic brilliant effect. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because luminescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> And that cost me about £140 each mound. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> But it tastes good. </seg>

<seg id="1551"> Place the tenderloin post-election post-election Beans </seg>
<seg id="1552"> The October elections rather than the winners have brought a bunch of losers. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> It is not only the parties, which are in or out of the Chamber of Deputies (SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and eventually ČSSD due to an internal split. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Politicians get us instead of the tenderloin holiday weekend post-election stew. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Springer elections happened Andrei Babiše movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and dissension in the winning side recording political (from) will Mr President Milos Zeman regardless of the wishes of the voters who supported President Zeman&apos;s party publicly, nor did to the House of Commons. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The president had lost because of unpleasant events strategic policy ahead of the others, but it still has several ways to get it back - for example, the choice of a future prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> While ČSSD the chance for a prime seat in my eyes away, traders Andreju Babišovi closing. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> So far though the post-election developments is miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of ČSSD left-wing government supported by the Communists, this development is the better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Given the loud opposition YES get together with the ODS and TOP 09, is still the most likely coalition scenario ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies). </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Because of the split in ČSSD, which thus became illegible and weak parterem in negotiations, the outcome of coalition negotiations can be daunting enough for ČSSD. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> The minority government ČSSD lodged with &quot;nezemanovců&quot; at the Castle probably won&apos;t pass. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> In addition, any government, to which the ČSSD will participate, will be jeopardised unmet ambition of many of the Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further split in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> I&apos;m asking myself: &apos;Nespějeme unassisted to another early elections?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Another option would have been more of a referendum on the strength of the voters&apos; mandate of the YES movement. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> ČSSD plans for the introduction of the tax sector, the marked increase in income taxes or the building of the State Bank fell hopefully under the table. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The ČSSD, YES, 19 and Dawn, on the contrary, agree to support business, for example, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, the lower tax rates for the selected goods. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Friction is most prevalent in the view on social policy and the size of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Yes, but now has the upper hand, so the program so far the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, 19, leaning more to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> From my point of view is that, in the end, a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything else in the economy moving. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> More recently, it seemed that the majority of the people in the Czech Republic wanted early elections. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Have been cited as the reasons of corruption, the squandering of money for overpriced purchases and state contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, the government scandals. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> According to the results of the elections can be drawn, that the majority of the citizens of this state suit. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> That they did not mind and with the status that was (theft and debt of this state, they were satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Otherwise, I cannot explain that the 3 413 497 voters there to vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for the ODS a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original ruling coalition, which represents 52,16% of all legal voters. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> That is an absolute majority. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> As a result of the above parties put 1 016 829 voters ČSSD, then the old order (because all the parties have been involved in the &quot;theft&quot; and that state borrowing), then with the condition actually agreed 64,23% of legitimate voters. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> This, in fact, a majority of voters made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty rozkradení and over-indebtedness of this state. </seg>

<seg id="1582"> The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating rink Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work has started on October 26 and from Wednesday&apos;s operation in aggregate for the production of ice. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> The ice layer is already seven inches thick and into early Friday morning, the area will be ready for the first visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> The area rink 375 square meters, took the podium 358 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Skaters and passers-by will also have two stands with punch. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> &quot;We expanded floor space, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so as to the skaters could comfortably přezouvat,&quot; described Spálený. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The streets of Olomouc recall the approaching Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Last year was the rink for a revision of the Lower Square installed directly in front of the main entrance hall on the Upper Square. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The repair of the Lower Square area of ice was completed at the end of the summer, so she can get back to its original place. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> For the first time people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink in operation from January to March. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> A sheet of ice then became an integral part of Christmas markets in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Christmas markets, which is part of the rich cultural program, will be launched at the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> The scientists more illuminated the movements of the tail is connected with the mood of the dog </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Earlier studies have shown that the radiant dog wags his tail more Justify|Right (from the perspective of a dog), while nervous dogs waving tail mainly to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> Now, however, scientists say, that the other dogs can detect these subtle differences in the movement of the tail and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a from the University of Trento said: &quot;with the people it is well known that the left and the right side of the brain are of different link to the incentives, which are positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1597"> The same thing we tried to discern in other species. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> He added that, just as it is in humans, dogs, too, is the right side of the brain responsible for the main movements, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> In an effort to gain more information about how the dogs respond to uneven wiggling tail of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals, which followed the films of other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Measured the heart rate of these animals and analyze their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> It will not be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on the one hand, and on the other. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;project we dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confounding incentives, and we also have been able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrated it more to the right or the left.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1603"> When she saw the animals otherwise lackluster move the dog&apos;s tail Justify|Right (from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), remained quite calm. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> When but recorded video tail mainly Justify|Left (again from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), their heart rate has increased and the animals seemed uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Professor Vallortigara said he does not think that the dogs through such movements of each other would knowingly communicating. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Rather, he believes that the dogs learned from experience, to which the movements he must and does not need to be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He said: &quot;if you several times with the dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is frequently associated with more friendly manner and move to the right breed less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1608"> The researchers say the findings may help the owners of dogs, vets and cvičitelům better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university teacher veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study, which examined whether left and right side is important for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turning his head to the left, while watching an aggressive dog, and on the right, when looking at a gay dog. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> And in another of the paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, said: &quot;the dog robot dogs are more likely to be acquainted when wagging his tail to the left than the right, which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite from the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The difference may be given to him by the dogs in these various studies of animals in the movies or dog robots nevykládali quite like dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> He explained, that could help the study of how the dogs respond to real dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> &quot;However, in the case of many different mammals, there is strong evidence that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> But given how easy it is to record their behavior, probably won&apos;t be long before we understand why it is their tail sometimes, on the one hand, and on the other. </seg>

<seg id="1848"> Talking to herself, or rather the dialogue, which lead the right and the left half of the brain, sometimes floats and forged in the book. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> As the period of peace are laced with sleeping metastases quietly wars, which is perhaps one day wake up - so my book is dressed in twelve years of silence. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> I felt I mute an avalanche of life is growing in the brain, and if I don&apos;t do anything, so one day I quietly sinks. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> It&apos;s a set of questions, which formulated the brain and by the classes, which are stored in the darkness beneath the surface of consciousness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Neokortex, gray rind of the brain, asking older evolutionary services, to the ancient letokruhům think tree. </seg>

<seg id="1855"> In the end, the brain wonders of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Relatively often speak to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically? </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Stored in their brain billion Communications and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and the experiences that the man lived. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> This forest logically and emotionally exposed and větvících trees of information, the register of memory, the brain uses in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to continuously variable presence, in continuing to try to identify and understand their surroundings and decode the important information. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> Sometimes arise from the congestion. </seg>

<seg id="1861"> For those who have not yet understood what it&apos;s all about - I&apos;m talking about psychospirituální crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> They speak of it often - why you just interested in this type of recourse on a regular basis? </seg>
<seg id="1863"> Because this is a hole. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> In most of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there is a gap. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> There&apos;s a good quote Nietzsche: &quot;staring into the abyss, the abyss looked to him for so long.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1866"> A genuine feeling - that man is lost when they disappear all hope, mentally &quot;dies&quot; and starts a new quality. </seg>

<seg id="1872"> To what extent do you think of the reader, at a particular person, who will read your text? </seg>
<seg id="1873"> That, of which cannot say anything meaningful, some call it the knowledge, another of the super ego, but it seems to me the best characterized Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend: </seg>
<seg id="1874"> &quot;I is someone else - that the reader is directly involved in the formulation of words and phrases.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1875"> From an early age he had read the books of the old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo&apos;s submarine ran after Stínadlech in dark alleys. </seg>

<seg id="1881"> And then, maybe after years on the street at random contact me and thank me, that I helped my book them in some of their heavy lifestyle decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The books are in fact &quot;lives&quot; or rather &quot;worlds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1883"> The characters are encoded in the letters, the experience, the history of the language. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Whenever we can revive, leaving their sentences flow to the brain. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> It is, in a way, something zakázaně divine - waking up more and more of the story, small universes and temporary planet. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It&apos;s the fact, whose DNA is stored in lines - under the old démonologických books make witchcraft. </seg>

<seg id="1921"> I have to write, I could be the man. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="1923"> In the hours of English literature will be read at least one of Shakespeare&apos;s plays, novel of the 19th century romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The test will also include the &quot;hidden text,&quot; to the incentive for deeper reading; </seg>

<seg id="1927"> The Department of Education should tomorrow - the first to issue a new curriculum for English and math courses, which are to undergo a radical change. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> In other major items of the changes are waiting for the next year. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> In a separate move the Ofqual Office, which oversees the graduation test detects changes in the structure of graduation tests, along with a new system of grading and less volume of projects for students. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> In his speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that there is &quot;a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our system of rehearsal, in order to regain the confidence of the company,&quot; and that it should be to insist that the graduation test was &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The study shows that the English schools spend less time mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> For comparison of the school in Australia in mathematics 143 hours per year on average, and in Singapore about 138. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Although no official request to devote more time mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that the comprehensive graduating math test results - along with more emphasis on this subject in the rankings - probably will encourage schools to provide extra classes. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> The curriculum will focus more on &quot;the problems of the real world,&quot; including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Ostravský Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Before the election, the full ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings of the battle for influence in Ostrava ČSSD. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> It all culminated in that, when the mayor of the city of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned on the court because of undemocratic establishment candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The players didn&apos;t want the cause is yet to comment too much more damage to the party before the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> But the votes of the electorate are numbered. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD so right on Monday night called the mayor of the city of Ostrava, that emerged from the party, and will probably push to come to his office. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Petr Kajnar but wants to fight on. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Disputes in terms of what and who is on whose side, described the exclusive interview to the Daily News. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> How you perceive the outcome of the election? </seg>
<seg id="1944"> ČSSD must be counted with a much better result. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> It damaged her with us, that will address the media before the election disputes within the Party? </seg>
<seg id="1946"> I can imagine that the outcome of the election could have better social democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> But on the other hand, it is a condition in which ČSSD now is. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Is that the party, which has its own internal problems, is mentally ill and people see it, that all is not well in it. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> In the election that gave clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> What are you ČSSD internal disease? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The decline for some time, to me, is going through the ODS and things like that, unfortunately, now taking place in social democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Isn&apos;t it, that the lobbyists, influential people, who had previously expected, they find that their prebendy in the ODS, moved to people in ČSSD and have an impact on them. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> It comes after the Oslo airport offices, then it has to do with the police and collects computers. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It shows that the ČSSD is composed of people who would like to think of the good of all the others, but many of them, in particular, for the good of their own. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps and in Prague, as can be seen even in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> But it is preparing for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> So, what took place before the elections in Ostrava, was just a precursor of what is happening now in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Haškovo wing gradually obsazovalo position, so that they could make the situation after the elections, which will weaken Sobotkovo wing. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> A man is in politics in a situation where sometimes must compromise. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> Each has some internal border, but when you don&apos;t compromise, and it is also my case. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Initially, I didn&apos;t want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, so I made a deal with Lubošem Zaorálkem, that will try to get to a regional candidate, has strengthened as the mayor of the city of Ostrava Sobotkovo right wing. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Haškovo wing but could stop. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Why are on the side of the Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michael Haška? </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Mussels Sobotka to me is a man who always talking mainly about ČSSD and, to some extent, the visions for the party and for the country. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> I confess that I didn&apos;t hear anything like that from the other side. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Michael Hašek just fighting for power. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> I don&apos;t understand, how can the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the Executive Committee to begin just refer to the President of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> It is a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the statute of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> According to me what now Michal Hašek demonstrated in Prague, ended his political career. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> As you are aware that you Ostrava leadership candidate ČSSD approve. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Political parties are based on competition, who are both members of their places. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> The competition should be, for the most part, based on the programming visions and the ability of the people you meet the vision. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Of course, however, by the competition report as well as people who don&apos;t have much ability and vision, but a political party is an elevator to the money for them, which they didn&apos;t get elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The problem is, when these people start getting to the forefront because unscrupulous violate the rules violate the statutes of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> They are doing their practices of the Mafia and the political parties to me that violate the laws of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than me to take into account that, if a Kajnar has a political future. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> It is important for the parties to respect the charter. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> That&apos;s why you have passed a motion to the court before the elections for an interim measure against candidates ČSSD form in the Moravian-Silesian region? </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The current district Executive Committee ČSSD in Ostrava he consolidates his power by the organization, which he does not approve of, can repeal of the new organization is based, gradually firing uncomfortable members of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> An example of this, however, is that they want to exclude Richard Bednaříka of representatives from the club, but he filed suit against it and then they cancelled the resolution on the exclusion of better. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It shows that the parties through the courts to enforce the observance of the constitution is the last option, but at the time when the other ways and control authorities in ČSSD stopped working, it is the only option. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD effort in the head with a member of Parliament Adam Rykalou&apos;s appeal to the position of mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> It is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post Poruby Lumír Palyza. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> It is so, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza is trying to do everything they could appeal to me. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> They promise to the people of the position, gaining votes and then for the voices of consolidating his power in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> When I go back to the past, so everything has to be passed around the football club Baník Ostrava and purchase the stadium Bazala, was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> It was artificially staged, so that I could be described as a man who gives money there, it doesn&apos;t belong. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> The city bought the property, which is strategically valuable to him. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> How do you see it on with his remaining in office Mayor? </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The district committee had invited me and some other people on Monday to consider their continued presence in ČSSD. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> I think that is so, as when a thief crying: Catch a thief! </seg>
<seg id="1992"> When we look at the results of my work over the past 11 years, so I don&apos;t see anyone in Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and pushed forward, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developing things, such as industrial zones or extensions are the park. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Yet all I become uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> Don&apos;t read it in a different way than that in the way the others piled on the place, after which he covets. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> You will fight against these efforts have somehow? </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Because if this one is the Republic work well, as political parties must also work well. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state, when he can&apos;t drive or herself. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Acknowledge, therefore, that I have now left the ČSSD, because I think this side, I&apos;m not the one who causes cancer, but these people who are trying to drive me. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> We want to show that, Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral </seg>
<seg id="2000"> It&apos;s a bit of a paradox. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> While his team was primarily výsledkově recently failed, a defender or midfielder Victoria Plzen František Rajtoral form that has earned him the following year to return to the team. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> He&apos;s doing as well as a total arc of fire, carousing activity, after surgery on him in the match in Teplice was granted the penalty kick. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The balloon came in the last two rounds against Slavii and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end of these two exercises taking only one point. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> František Rajtoral believes that his team in the match with an unpleasant series Jabloncem breaks. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> We want to show that we can win. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> &quot;I believe that Jablonec home defeat,&quot; says František Rajtoral. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> The team is in a tough fight with Severočechy, who play offensive football, carefully prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> Everything is going to match with Jabloncem coach prepares us well, as always we draw from a lot of rival videorozboru games as well. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> &quot;I believe that in Friday night, it will be a great game,&quot; the Czech representative lures fans in the stands of the Doosan Arena. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Pilsen last games didn&apos;t work as well as it wants, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> So it goes in football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> But I haven&apos;t spoken in any way on the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> &quot;I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again,&quot; says defender Západočechů. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> The victory will once again rely on the support of the fans. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> &quot;playing on Friday night and that I would like our fans, who are great, invite.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2016"> &quot;I believe that they odvděčíme prize,&quot; adds Rajtoral. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Defense of academic freedom, it applies for Zeman and the ODS. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> I have repeatedly urged the open letters in recent months, students, educators and the middle and high schools in several parts to defend academic freedom before the election campaign, which in schools by President Milos Zeman. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> I met with more or less success. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> The Principal of Masaryk University in Brno, which refused an honorary chairman SPOZ ZEMANOVCI lecture in the pre-election period, considered that got even retaliation in the form of nepozvání to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Here is a list of the schools, who have been so brave and visit Miloš Zeman possible Cloud|Eye Technical University in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of business in Ostrava, Business College in Cologne, H.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Now meet in Pardubice with continuing promoting policies at universities. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Newly elected MP for the ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and, in addition, it seems normal to him. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Professor, it really is not the same as if you had stayed, for example, in his capacity as mayor of a small town. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> Do you want to include ČSSD vykovávají at the same time as the Member for regional presidents and general and as they degrade the profession? </seg>
<seg id="2026"> That is, people say, that are difficult to handle both the left back. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> I know we have an example of Michael Haška, which handles even a few dozen functions at once. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> But it is not just an example of the person you should drive. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> We find the opposite, as well as a positive example Štěpánky Fraňkové that better left&apos;s post, so that it can fully address the leadership of the city of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main reason for my recommendation to the dean&apos;s office, however, is that the combination of the functions you break apolitičnost academic soil of the University of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> The leadership of the various ODS sees your current tenure at both positions as an advantage for the University. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> &quot;their&quot; school, however, you will be able to help you stay, even without the dean. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> I think I have a similar view as president of Miroslav Ludwig, and I will have your students. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Consider, then, even his resignation and keep his face. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Otherwise, you may be that voters in the next election count. </seg>

<seg id="2051"> But before the commission said that, in his opening statement to the committee this association said that never discussing the case of sexual abuse of a child in your organization. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case, which was one of the staff of the YMCA associations accused of offences relating to child pornography, and on the other, when P.E in the Caringbah YMCA of the association was convicted in 1991 of children for sexual harassment, which was in their custody. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Mr. Hare Gaili Furnessové, Counsellor Commission, said that he knew about the case, but not on the other. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> He admitted that the start of the YMCA was also inaccurate, as stated that the YMCA in the organization to carry out external audits, which praised the organization as the champion of the rights of children. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> The evidence submitted to the commission is talking about it, that the YMCA was alerted to it, that in an audit of the Ministry of Education and the company from August of this year, the second lowest of the four possible ratings. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA associations, when he was 21, he said, that the leadership itself from him down failed, when Mr Lord adopted, without assurances that it is aware of the staff of the obligation to report violations of the rules of the safety of the children. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Earlier this year Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys, which has committed during the two years when he worked at the YMCA associations. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> He was jailed for a minimum of six years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> Mr. Hare but rejected the claim that the YMCA associations have a cultural problem, which prevented staff to report security breaches of children by the Lord. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Staff members provide evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, privately is watching, let&apos;s sit on his lap, they used to say that, like them, and he is playing with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Danielle Ockwellová Lordovou a child and asked for the training of the safety of the children, because she worried his behavior, testified that Jacqui BARNAT, head for services to children in the Caringbah YMCA associations in the city, which was Lordovým superiors, was &quot;very intimidating and often it was difficult to talk with him about something. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> The Director General said that it does not accept the evidence of personnel that they felt uncomfortable, if they had contacted their superiors and report the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Instead, he said, that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, and therefore nenahlásili problem. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Mr Hare said that the board of the YMCA associations in New South Wales state its view that the lessons learned from the case of Jonathan Lord&quot; for the organisation lies in the fact that the staff &quot;did not file any report,&quot; and the Council agreed with him in it. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Mr Hare said that the decision to have the staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged, made by General Manager for services to children in the organisation of the YMCA Liamem Whitleym. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> He said that the aim was to avoid a distortion of the evidence, but was &quot;overly zealous&quot; and poorly executed. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> An expert on sexual abuse of children by Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffithovy YMCA in New South Wales, said the commission was not in the years 2009 to 2011, which would be safe for children. </seg>

<seg id="2070"> The president of the Union of entrepreneurs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green economies should continue. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Czech construction is dealing with continuous decline in the volume of orders since 2008 and indifference to the state to resolve the issue of investment construction. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> Publication of the programme New green economies was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized businesses in the regions. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is a great opportunity not only for the citizens, who after the implementation of the measures save significant amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and the manufacturer of building materials. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> Each invested one billion would bring the state more than 2700 of newly created jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state are significant leverage and the multiplier effects, it is also one of the most significant growth measures. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The Association of entrepreneurs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic, therefore, in principle does not agree with the resolution of the government and calls for the implementation of such events, which would allow a continuation of the program, to be published in the context of his other challenges. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> FAA: Air passengers can now use technological gains in aircraft (but may not call from their mobile phones) </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from gate to gate&quot; - in addition to calls from their mobile phones - reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the expected new rules, issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) impatiently. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> But passengers do not expect changes occur immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to the airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The airlines will have to manage the FAA to demonstrate how much their aeroplanes that comply with the new rules and update training manuals for cabin crew and the directive for storage facilities, in order to comply with the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> The FAA said it has already received from some of the airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> &quot;depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,&quot; the FAA said in its statement. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> At present the required of passengers, to shut down their smart phones, tablets and other devices, as soon as he closes the door of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> They cannot be turned on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> From passengers, their equipment is expected to shut down again when the plane landed, and declined to nezapnou is, as long as the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Under the new rules, airlines, whose planes are properly protected against electronic interference, to allow its passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> Since the majority of new transport planes and other aircraft, which has been adjusted so that passengers can use breakfast at a higher altitude, is expected to meet those criteria. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> Laura Gladingová, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> &quot;as soon as the new rules will be implemented safely - and we - the airlines will cooperate closely on it, it will be a success,&quot; she said in her statement Gladingová. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> Us frankly tired, that we look like &quot;the guards.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2093"> But surfing on the Internet, send e-mail and SMS or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometers altitude, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Passengers will be notified to their smart phones, tablets and other devices switched to flight mode. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> So still no Words with friends, online game of Scrabble, played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when, as is well known, was thrown from the aircraft to American Airlines, because he refused to turn off their equipment when the plane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> And the heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that it could hurt someone if flying around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Calls from mobile phones will be on board to continue to be banned. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify the FAA, but the American Federal Committee for telecommunications. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The FAA may in some electronic devices during take-off and landing to repeal the ban. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Mark Rosenker last month from the National Safety Committee in transport, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> &quot;Mobile phones are really the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with the navigational instruments, but we also know that in the air may cause interference from the FCC data transmission towers,&quot; Rosenker said. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Trade advisory committee created by the FAA, therefore, to examine this issue, last month suggested that the government would allow wider use of electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The FAA has in recent years come under pressure to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskillová, a Democrat from Missouri, argues that there is no legitimate security reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> The restrictions are also becoming more difficult to enforce, because of the use of such devices is ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Some studies suggest that up to a third passenger forgets to turn off their devices or ignores her. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio, technical achievement of the times. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> The new airlines are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations, but the aircraft are also designed and approved by the FAA, that was resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The airline has already offered to passengers after several years of use of Wi-Fi in travel altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> The plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to jamming. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The vast majority of the airlines should adapt to the new rules for the greater use of electronic devices, said Huertová. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> The current electronic devices generally emit radio broadcasts, much less intense than it was in the previous generation facilities. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> The electronic reader, for example, issued only a minimum broadcasting in turning the page. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> But the broadcast is stronger when they withdrew the device or transmitting data. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Among those who are pushing for it to relax restrictions on the use of such devices by passengers, is. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> In 2011 the company representatives loaded airliner its Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real, and that, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> Other members of the committee said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots, to support the fact that such devices can cause interference of air systems, and most of these reports is very old. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> The committee, however, recommended that the FAA allowed pilots ordered passengers off the device during instrument flying at low visibility. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, according to her on a sensible approach for the travelling public, that the technology used in abundance. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that it is not a pleasant travel experience in conflict with safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, the Executive Director of the American travel associations. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said that American intelligence had &quot;gone too far&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2124"> John Kerry indicated smooth defense of the US position on their monitoring programmes and, in an unprecedented admission, he said, that &quot;went too far&quot; in some cases of espionage. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> The foreign minister also said that, together with Barack Obama is responsible for the fact that, with regard to the incendiary revelations about the NSA spying, which appeared thanks to an informant Edward Snowdenovi, acted as a &quot;autopilot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2126"> The disclosure triggered a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> Mr. Kerry through video-spojení on open government conference in London said: &quot;there is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have really learned about some of the things that the guns because there was the possibility of inertia, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, the September 11.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2128"> He became the first high-ranking member of the US government, therefore, who admitted that the American espionage crossed the border, but stressed that it did not violate anyone&apos;s rights. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> He said: &quot;in some cases it has gone too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2130"> And the president is determined to try to explain it to the people and to clarify and has now made a thorough review, so that no one had the feeling that the abuse occurred. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> I assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is seeking the good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> He added: &quot;face of the new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2134"> There is in the world of radical extremism, which is firmly committed murder and fire people up and attack the government. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> And what if you were able to detect and stop it before it happens? </seg>
<seg id="2136"> In fact we avoid falling off the aircraft, didn&apos;t they go off buildings and people were executed, because now we can learn about these plans forward. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that the American lawmakers are going to Europe, to respond to the concerns from abroad, which relate to alleged American espionage, and convince the Europeans, that is to continue to combine their forces in the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and other parties this week and that he worried about their threats, that stops the participation in anti-terrorist organizations, because they are frustrated by the National Security Agency (NSA). </seg>

<seg id="2140"> And I&apos;m heading to Europe, I made it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, upset relations with US allies, even though the agency&apos;s chief said this week that they have been inaccurate and reflect misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies gathered and shared with the United States </seg>
<seg id="2142"> Other revelations cited documents compromised Snowdenem, that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders to 34. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper espionage allies defended as necessary and said that this is a routine matter from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> In the midst of Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip, which should take place this year, and hopes that will arise in the delegation members of both parties and chambers. </seg>

<seg id="2146"> He said that he was still working on the program. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Although Murphy said that the aim of the trip is to help repair relations, he added, that they will be ready and &quot;well-intentioned nurturing measures.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2148"> He said that European leaders must be honest to his own people, in respect of the spy programs, which for years on their own use. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> &quot;While we adjust their monitoring programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also must be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones here was spying,&quot; Murphy said. </seg>

<seg id="2153"> Pursuant to Section 33 of the criminal law, to denigrate the presidency threatened a fine of $100 to one year imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> &quot;Prosecutors should not blame anxious people who one&apos;s president in pubs or other public places,&quot; said representatives of the Constitutional Court. </seg>

<seg id="2164"> Despite the heavy hand of that Mugabe ruled the country for more than 33 years, adopted in March of Zimbabwe on the basis of the referendum, a new constitution with wider civil liberties. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> Small steps in the direction of the country from a dictatorship of one man climbed in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought to this Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangiraje chair. </seg>

<seg id="2588"> But since Edward Snowden, who became an informer of a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of the secret monitoring of the United States, European governments and business leaders do not know if they believe the words of the director. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> After the news that the U.S. National Security Agency conducted espionage in the Brazilian oil company and has access to the data, with whom they have American cloudoví providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about government monitoring of new dimensions. </seg>

<seg id="2609"> Many of the senior German officials argue that recent reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: That powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> That economic espionage is carried out, it is not surprising. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> It is always happening. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> &quot;It&apos;s a major issue for many years and has significantly changed that even during the current debate,&quot; says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the agrochemical company BASF. </seg>

<seg id="2616"> Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automakers Audi, says that it is common practice for many years gathering before the meeting of the Board of Directors of mobile phones, so that they could not be used as a listening device. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The German office BFV directors direct, to consider whether the use of foreign guests simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk that smart phones can compromise. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Prepaid mobile phones, then fired. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> There is concern, however, that the small and medium-sized businesses will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their specific areas of the market. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> &quot;to small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets to neautorizovanému approach,&quot; warns in its report BFV. </seg>

<seg id="2626"> The new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> A single dose of the vaccine could for life to protect the mouse from addiction to nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Before the tests on people&apos;s need to carry out further tests, which take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York, says that the first indications are good. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> &quot;firmly hope that this kind of vaccine strategy may finally help to millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that, all the current approaches to overcome,&quot; said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was set up so that carried the genetic information for the creation of a antinikotinových antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to create a continuous stream of these antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The antibodies hunt all nicotine molecules in the blood stream and neutralise them before they get into the brain, thereby preventing a smoker of nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> In tests of the vaccinated mice, which was subsequently delivered nicotine, continue their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> But the mice that were not vaccinated,&quot; the calm,&quot; said the researchers, which is a sign that nicotine they got into the brain. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> The experiments are described in the journal Science translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> The previous tobacco vaccine failed because it contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The injections would be administered so often, in order to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so have proved expensive and impractical. </seg>

<seg id="2646"> He said that Obama&apos;s sincere efforts to derail the Republican obstruction </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Obstructive policy cannot excuse Web pages of Obama&apos;s health care woes or attacks by unmanned aircraft </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Memoirs of Obama&apos;s campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have happened </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Nathaniel P. Morris the second year studying medicine at Harvard. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> In those days I read a book so sad. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> I thought about this book, that inspires me during the grim days of my second year in medical school and restore a modicum of hope in me. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (waltzing to victory) and memories of Barack Obama&apos;s presidential campaign in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> When the evening finish reports of patients and I&apos;m going to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches will take your breath. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> The elections are over overwhelming and television news forced us to consider the historical value of this moment. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> My classmates wept with joy and my parents have kept the paper, which got. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The young team headed to the White House visionaries and the nation was ready for a change. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> During the office in 2008, Obama had the support of 82 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> And here the book closing. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> Go to the present there is harsh awakening, as talk of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> It is hard to remember these optimistic days - seem distant memories, a sad reminder of lost opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> In the years after I threw my first election ticket, really has to change. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> It was certainly nothing from what I imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> I acknowledge that Obama has reached a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law on the care available through the evacuation of our troops out of Iraq and end the policy of &quot;don&apos;t ask, to say nothing&quot; after the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> In addition, I believe, partisan obstruction reverse so many efforts to move our nation forward: Among other is that immigration reform, the public option to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánámu. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> But in many situations, when I was in front of colleagues and friends said the Obama administration, I, as regards the explanation, which can provide, came to the absolute limit. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> I found myself in the place of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Obstruction for Republican Spain cannot explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders with drones raids that kill innocent children overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> It cannot be explained by them, that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, nor that haunts those who reveal improper conduct of the government. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> It cannot be held responsible for the execution of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlakího without proper court even for reducing public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The findings of the report, which cannot be justified by them, he says, that the White House efforts to silence the media are &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2671"> And most recently cannot excuse the failure to create more than three years after the signing of the available care simple Web pages. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> I don&apos;t know whether to expect something like that. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> If I had known in 18 years, that the government&apos;s power may be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> An elected office apparently does not have a predictable pattern and the opposition political party will shape our public talks and random events, such as the massacre in Newton. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> But all the examples that I mentioned above, is to a large extent appear to be the result of the administration&apos;s decision. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> And that worries me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Obama voted again in 2012, but not because I was excited for his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Mitt Romney represented zmatečnou and nevybroušenou alternative and seemed to be able to consolidate its policy or position. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, of which we have heard once. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Yet it is a return to 2008 - with it, how to support Obama this week dropped by 45% - through this book increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It makes me remember that a number of promises, which had vanished. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat in the primaries in Pennsylvania, with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> At the meeting, his staff said during the campaign that he needs to get back into a rhythm and remain faithful to their mission. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> &quot;I want to get back our magic,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> We must not lose sight of who we are. </seg>

<seg id="2713"> Watch on Thursday indicated that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures. </seg>

<seg id="2727"> The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria is running one of the largest European energy projects, said the director of Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> &quot;Today we are witnessing landmark: Construction began on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline project, the largest and most important in Europe,&quot; Gazprom president Alexei Miller said in its statement. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the Russian export routes across Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are &quot;forever&quot; removed. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Once the project begins its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline for a reduced rate. </seg>

<seg id="2736"> Early puberty: Advanced earlier </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The research showed that Afroameričanky and Hispánky are reaching puberty earlier than their Caucasian contours. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The physical changes do not mean that the approaching adolescence </seg>
<seg id="2739"> It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind it </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Experts say one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The trend is not so evident earlier puberty for boys. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children&apos;s health and family problems. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Should the mother zděsit, when her daughter will start to grow breasts and pubic hair at the groin at 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2744"> At the annual conference of the American College of Surgeons explained this week in Orlando, Florida pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> &quot;I spent a lot of time, that I am assured parents that it&apos;s not usually a sign of rapid development in the direction of a teenager,&quot; Kaplowitz said </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Visible signs of development, such as the growth of their breasts, hair at the groin and armpits and body odor, the girls have previously. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> For the last forty years he was, however, just a small shift in the age of the first period. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> In the United States is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to age 12,75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> &quot;When you start to develop breasts, expire at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book &quot;Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem&quot; (Early puberty in girls: Essential guide to tackle this growing problem) </seg>
<seg id="2750"> The most reliable test of how puberty will continue, it&apos;s time. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The debate about what makes a real start puberty, but if the breast growth is accompanied by growth spurtem before 8 year old girl is considered &quot;prematurely mature.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2752"> In most cases the process slows or stops - which may paediatric doctors closely monitored. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to run tests to exclude the serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: Premature ageing bones, which can ultimately lead to a halt of growth and dwarfism in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> The recommendations are dependent on drugs and hormone treatment at the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Psychosociologické aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> As regards the deployment of medicines, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that &quot;the suppression of puberty may alleviate the problems with the conduct of the girl and her feelings, that is different from their peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to have their very young daughters periods. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> &quot;I do worry that they may become pregnant, or how it will handle the hygiene,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; says one woman, whose daughter began to have menstrual periods in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation, was not prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> She came home from school frightened and angry, that is the first of his friends. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> There are a number of well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Still, however, there is a file of evidence, that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> The boys as girls are reaching puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the reason for this is the most serious epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> In 2001 helped with the study is carried out on girls aged from 6 to 9 years, which connects with the timing of puberty of body fat. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> In this country and Hispánky Afroameričanky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> The explanations are various. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> From a global perspective, it seems that the designs of the early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions over the climate after the genes. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Another puzzle: Although for boys are already at a young age appears hair on the face and in the groin, a trend toward full bloom early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> Other doctors participating in a conference of the American Association of pediatric doctors (AAP) added more complexity to this subject. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Acne and hair groin is common even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> &quot;We have to be careful, as to how to identify the real onset of puberty,&quot; said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey Goryebské. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Parents should not hesitate to get from your doctor&apos;s instructions on how to talk with your child. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> &quot;It may mean that we need to talk with the child sooner than you expected,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> If you stay calm, your child is likely to be responding well. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> The girls, who are evolving, they need the assurance that, even if it is premature, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2790"> According to its sources were Russian-made SA-8 missiles. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Israel refused to comment on the report, but a military analyst Ron ben Yishai said that Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with rockets and Syrian Air Force teaches members of Hezbollah&apos;s armed wing to use missiles. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> SA-8 missiles are outdated, that the Syrian army has since the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> They are placed on a floating chassis. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Although they are relatively primitive, mobility and small size makes it possible is easily concealed. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> They are equipped with radar, but after firing missiles off, so it&apos;s hard to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Latákíja lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alávity. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> The area is well guarded and Hezbollah has in the past involved in the fighting in western Syria. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Syria&apos;s claims that it helps to protect the Shiite community, to which alávité belongs. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> It is now reportedly 15,000 of its fighters ready to help conquer the army back Kalamún. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> Along with Hezbollah in the Syrian army also strengthens its troops. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Kalamún Homsem lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The battle has been under al-Arabíji resources in retaliation for the recent attack the headquarters of the opposition Syrian Shia brigade Fadla Abu Abbas in Shiite parts of Damascus. </seg>

<seg id="2819"> He warned, however, that he was elected just two days before. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The two MPs have said then that they would do everything to the 50-strong club ČSSD was one voice. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Absurd theater put on a crown Michal Hašek sentence: &quot;I am a member of ČSSD fifteen years, I have always been loyal to the brand and I respected the ruling party organs.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2872"> The Australian airline passengers will have to remain off their tablets and smart phones during the launching and landing without regard to changes in the US for a relaxation of the rules in relation to these devices. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave space for American companies to change their practices, so passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games on its facilities during critical phases of flight, when the device will remain in the &quot;air&quot; scheme. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> Passengers already can do this during most of the flight, but many people poisoned, that they cannot have access to electronic books during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The Australian carrier from American carriers are exploring this decision, which requires a great deal of work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change its practice soon. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also examined the announcement, he said, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot;Casa currently has no specific rules regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The question is covered by the regulations, which require aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained at all times and that passengers are acting in accordance with security guidelines, which will receive from the crew members. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The company Virgin, which already with CASA talked about expanding the use of its in-flight entertainment system wi-fi, was in favour of change, but announced that it will be subjected to the decision of the regulatory authority. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> &quot;We welcome, if the CASA conducted an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would be now, when we have (wireless in-flight entertainment), improved customer experiences,&quot; the spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Qantas announced that, for the time being, I will stick to the current regulations. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention to change in the near future,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> But we are interested in the developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and be sure to thoroughly study the FAA decision and the reasons are behind him. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> In the case of air carriers from the US company with the impact of the rules will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, and also to review the manuals, training materials, programs for carry-on baggage and passenger information. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> &quot;as soon as the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, passengers can afford to use electronic devices, such as tablets, light and portable electronic readers and smart phones, at any altitude,&quot; the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> In rare cases of low visibility crew ordered passengers to get off during landing gear. </seg>

<seg id="2890"> Nonsense in the film gravity are, but the show is a beautiful, say experts </seg>
<seg id="2891"> A fantastic movie from the universe of gravity vyprodával some time after the premiere of the movie in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> In October saw him under the Union&apos;s film distributors almost 150,000 spectators and earned over 26 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> Most of the reviews of the slide in a positive light. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Other things in it, however, is located some inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists on it, how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense, which appeared in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Jiří Dušek (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Brno): I like science-fiction movies, which I consider to be modern, dreamlike fairy tales. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The film gravity included, even though he faces as &quot;physically real&quot; show. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> It is not, but that does not mean that he was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> I&apos;ve enjoyed it very much. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> See you can be Sandra Bullock&apos;s hair, which is sort of raises in microgravity. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Hubbův space telescope and the International Space Station move after significantly different orbits, therefore, cannot be seen in one frame. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Some viewers of the film about unrealistically active effect and all of the behavior of fire in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The suits would also hold such wounds. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> The heroes in the film gravity is often come into conflict with various objects and suits without much trouble all last. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> The criticism has not been spared either the plotline. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> So much tragedy in the orbit of the Earth is unrealistic, according to some people. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Moreover, wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair technique. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> The people on the forums arguing about the &quot;unrealistic&quot; behaviour ropes. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> She said work, as if it was intended for bungee jumping. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Marcel Grün (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Prague): I saw him just yet on a broad canvas, but I can say unequivocally, I was enchanted. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I&apos;m glad it wasn&apos;t a film documentary, but science- fiction. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> And in this story the author has the right (almost an obligation) made the consistently reality. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> &quot;More than you mention irregularities, it struck me, as it is displayed three times the space station to downgrade the level of technology (last Chinese).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2914"> &quot;China will be until the end of the decade and probably will look better than it is in the movie.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Vladimir Karas (Astronomického, director of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer generated scenes are very successfully trying to leave the authors of the laws of physics, and so přírodovědně oriented audience appreciate that the various cosmic collisions and precipitation quite rightly observes the angular momentum, said the dictionary physics, also look at Earth from space is very realistic including thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering on the polar regions. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The discrepancies will surely find the details. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> In addition, for example, in reading the comments I found that the preferred direction circulation of space debris in orbit seems to be turned in some scenes, than it should in fact be (from west to east). </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Jiří Štěpán (Astronomického employee of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things you makers have adapted to their needs, but no major and blatant transgression against logic or the laws of nature in the film, I notice and in comparison with other films like the focus is to see, given that the makers depend on the credibility of the event. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> Of those moments that don&apos;t make sense is worth it to the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than ISS. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> The result is considerably different mutual speed and a rescue operation would therefore, in fact, could not take place as shown in the film. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> Then at the moment of separation of Stone and Kowalski (Clooney) (Bullock) I noticed that all the ISS was rotating, therefore it is not even clear the origin of the force to try, which makes both players to let go of the moment is already against each other at a standstill. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Bombardier profit fell as a result of a drop in orders and deliveries </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday 15% decline in net profit, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems in the drive train. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not disclose any data on air test for its new CSeries aircraft, even offering up-to-date information, as to whether the plane would comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> After the opening test flight about a month and a half before the plane flew only three times and appeared on the question of whether the testing phase is proceeding well. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> The results have not materialized estimates, and the shares on the stock exchange in Toronto fell by 8 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen declined Thursday rating from &quot;higher returns&quot; to &quot;exercise sector &quot;with the expectation that the stock market will experience a limited growth during the next quarter or two. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> &quot;while smaller aircraft deliveries are expected for the most part, the profit margin in the field of transport us greatly disappointed,&quot; Doerksen said in a report to clients. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> With that, as a test program will continue, we believe, that Bombardier CSeries aircraft will get new orders. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that market scepticism towards this programme will increase. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> Bombardier CSeries probojují hopes that the aircraft type at the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> The first test plane was discovered in March, after months of delay in the September held the first years. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> The number of binding orders the CSeries aircraft, however, is modest 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company&apos;s claim on the consumption and low savings on the cost of transport aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Currently, a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected when the first plane into commercial use will reach their goal by Bombardier 300 binding orders. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The executives also on Thursday assured analysts and the media, that the program is proceeding according to plan. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> &quot;test the plane remained on the ground for longer than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said in the conference call, and said that examination on the ground and software updates were planned during the shutdown of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Each manufacturer is planned to be otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the update and we did that. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> It will happen during the entire flight programme. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> According to Bombardier, the second of five test planes should fly in the coming weeks and the other not long after. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> Analysts are still skeptical of it, that would be the first customer could begin to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Bombardier claims to evaluate his plan of the aircraft in service and in the coming months will provide updated information. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> &quot;this slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in accordance with the internal plan Bombardier - probably will reinforce our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of the year 2015,&quot; Doerksen said. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Of the $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year&apos;s net profit fell in the third quarter ending September 30 Bombardier to $147 million, or 8 cents per share. </seg>

<seg id="2950"> Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Outstanding contracts in aviation division accounted for 30 September 32.9 billion, which is not even on 31 December. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The results were in line with our forecasts, but the low income in aviation orders and the overall state of the market failed us,&quot; Beaudoin said. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The yield fell by 13 percent to $2 billion in the aviation industry. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest producer of trains, said that revenue in the division rose almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> Outstanding contracts in the transport sector amounted to 30 September 32.6 billion, which is a marginal growth compared to December 31. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> The profit margin in the traffic division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several contracts. </seg>
