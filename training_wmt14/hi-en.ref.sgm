<seg id="1"> RBS suspends two forex traders </seg>
<seg id="2"> Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Some of the world&apos;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world&apos;s largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators. </seg>
<seg id="6"> &quot;Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week. </seg>
<seg id="10"> None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr Usher&apos;s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said. </seg>
<seg id="12"> UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks. </seg>
<seg id="13"> At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland&apos;s competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market. </seg>
<seg id="14"> HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Banks are scouring through years&quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks&apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks&quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot;you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="19"> The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators. </seg>
<seg id="21"> &quot;We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained,&quot; Credit Suisse said. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New politics has begun following the changes in the boards of the Municipal Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Recently, in the Santhiya Municipal Corporation&apos;s Beerbhum District, due to the party change of legislators the Congress led board changed to the Trunamool board. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This change occurred because most of the legislators, including the Chairman of the Municipal Corporation, joined Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not only from Congress, but some of the legislators from CPM, CPI, and Forward Block have also joined Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy admits it augurs well for the party. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that the Santhiya Municipal Corporation Chairman, Virendra Parikh, and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, along with 10 Congress legislators, have joined Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Some legislators from CPM and Left Front have also joined Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="29"> All of them informed the District Collector in writing, as required by the Bengal Municipal Act, that they have joined Trunamool and because of its majority the Santhiya Municipal Corporation board will come under Trunamool Control. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Mr. Rai also claimed that everyone agrees with the development template decided upon under the leadership of the Chief Minister, Mamta Banerjee. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Political leaders from Congress, the CPM, the CPI, Forward Bloc and other political leaders are moving to join the Trinamool Congress. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Appropriate leaders from any party are welcome to join Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The control by Trunamool of the Santhilya Municipal Board due to the change of the party by congress legislators before the November 22nd elections to be held in 5 Municipal Corporations is considered as an important development in the political arena. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Before this the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Congress-ruled Nadia Municipal boards had also come under the control of Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="35"> When the Municipal boards in the district come under Trunamool party control, due to the change of party, then the new members of the party are made very welcome in Kolkata at the Trunamool Bhavan. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders breaking away from other parties to join the Trinamool party. </seg>
<seg id="37"> He said that leaders breaking away from any party were welcome to join Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="38"> He claims that the people&apos;s trust in Chief Minister Mamata Banarjee&apos;s leadership is increasing, and that this is the reason people are joining Trunamool. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The main opposition CPM is claiming that grassroots leaders of the other parties are being threatened and bullied. </seg>
<seg id="40"> People are joining them due to the fear of Trunamool&apos;s threats. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The change in the elected local boards is being considered as a blow to democracy by CPM. </seg>
<seg id="42"> It is a right of any party to increase their support base in a democracy but, there are obvious questions  raised by changes of opinion on the accountability of power. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The bike was found abandoned near the forests of Pipcho. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The police have taken the bike into custody. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The bike belonged to JRPO postman Chhoti Mehta. </seg>
<seg id="46"> He has been assigned to the Assembly elections at the state level to Election Director and reception committees. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The strong contestant of State Vice-President Raipur North Seat, Sachchidanand Upasane, has been appointed Raipur Rural Seat&apos;s election Director. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Upasane has been asked to handle the State office and also tour the State if required. </seg>
<seg id="49"> As the State President Ramsevak Paikara and Secretary Shivratan Sharma, along with many other officials, are contesting the elections, Secretary Rampratap is left to handle the organisation alone. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Because of this, Upasane has been handed a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The North seat contestant, RDA President Sunil Soni, has been given the responsible position of the Raipur South Seat election director. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Another contender, Regional Municipal Corporation Chairman Sanjay Srivastava, has been given a seat on the reception committee. </seg>
<seg id="53"> He will receive the party&apos;s star campaigner national leaders to help the coming and going. </seg>
<seg id="54"> On this committee there are some more contenders, along with Soni. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Shyam Basaarng seat and Leelaraam Bhojwani will conduct the election for the Rajnandgaon seat. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Implicating Bishnoi, the MP said that eating Curma on one day at the home of a family from a particular community and publishing photos does not make you a supporter of the poor. </seg>
<seg id="57"> They go to various houses and eat Curma three times a day, but never boast about it. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The MP Dipendra Hooda from Rohtak, in a meeting of the Congress activists  from the Maham Halake, said that the rally conducted on November 10th in Gohana was very important for you and us. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The opposition will realise the strength of the Government by the crowds that gather for the rally. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Prof. Virendra and MLA Anand Singh Dangi also addressed the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="61"> They handed over a list of 10,000 activists coming to the rally from different villages to the MLA. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Before the meeting the MLA visited the covered shed in the grain market, the second water reservoir in Maham, the National Multi-Technology Institute building, the widening of the Gohana- Lakhanjara - Maham -Bhiwani Road along with the construction site of the Maham four lane road fly-over and ground preparation. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The Rural Distrct President of Congress, Jaideep Dhankhad, Jagat Kala, Dharmbeer Vakil, Balaram Dangi, Vikas Sisar, Shamsher Kharak, Anil Sharma, Dr. Sunil Rangi, Deepak Gupta, Dharamraj Sarpanch, Sadhu Baba and Nirmala Rathi were also present at this event. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Asaram, jailed on sexual assault charges, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It was pleaded on behalf of Asaram that the media coverage is presenting him as a kind of Dracula drinking the blood of children, but the Supreme Court denied his request to ban the media coverage. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Chief Judge P. Satshivam&apos;s panel refused to ban the media coverage about Asaram and said that they had read every word reported by the media and had not found anything objectionable in it. </seg>
<seg id="67"> When they are receiving information from the police and other people how can we stop them? </seg>
<seg id="68"> Before that Asaram&apos;s lawyers accused the media of showing highly biased news. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The country has so many newspapers and news channels. </seg>
<seg id="70"> They cannot file cases against every one of them, but the panel was not influenced by this plea and refused to file a complaint, saying that they had other options too. </seg>
<seg id="71"> The Court has already previously denied Asaram&apos;s request to ban the media coverage. </seg>
<seg id="72"> A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring the UK together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="75"> Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; to work with the UK government on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="77"> When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="78"> In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="82"> We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="84"> But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="86"> For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; back Scotland&apos;s inclusion in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Mr Brown said: &quot;High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland&apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="88"> So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning. </seg>
<seg id="89"> I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The National President of the Anti-Terrorism Front, Maninder Singh Bitta, will read Shree Hanuman Chalisa along with 10,000 other readers on November 23rd, at an event organised by the Shri Hindu Nyaypeeth at Dana Mandi near the Jalandhar bypass. </seg>
<seg id="91"> This information was provided by Bitta after the chief spokesman of Shri Hindu Nyaypeeth Pravin Dang and Ashwini Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surji Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla,Bantu and Aman Sharma, had come to invite him to the Hanuman Chalisa Paath. </seg>
<seg id="92"> He appreciated the efforts of the Shri Hindu Nyaypeeth to make children aware of Sanatan Culture. </seg>
<seg id="93"> He said it is also important to give children religious instruction along with worldly education for the unity and integrity of the country. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The Supreme Court has refused to ban media reporting. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The Supreme Court said that they cannot ask the media to stop reporting information collected from the police or any other source. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Asaram&apos;s lawyer said that Asaram was being made out to be a kind of Dracula in this case. </seg>
<seg id="97"> In this case, the guidelines for reporting are in place but they are not being followed. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The Supreme Court said that there are several other options that could be used. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Asaram&apos;s lawyer said that there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels in the country, but specifically there were having problems with two channels. </seg>
<seg id="100"> These people were damaging his image and are guilty of one-sided reporting. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Asaram&apos;s rights should be protected in this case. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The Court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram&apos;s lawyer that they have other legal options which they may make use of. </seg>
<seg id="103"> A black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="104"> As America&apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America&apos;s major roads. </seg>
<seg id="106"> The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill. </seg>
<seg id="108"> The tea party is aghast. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues. </seg>
<seg id="110"> And while Congress can&apos;t agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting. </seg>
<seg id="111"> They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive. </seg>
<seg id="113"> This really is a must for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="114"> &quot;It is not a matter of something we might choose to do,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="115"> There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The technology is there to do it. </seg>
<seg id="117"> The push comes as the country&apos;s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Americans don&apos;t buy as much gas as they used to. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Cars get many more miles to the gallon. </seg>
<seg id="120"> The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn&apos;t gone up in 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high. </seg>
<seg id="122"> &quot;The gas tax is just not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="123"> His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system. </seg>
<seg id="124"> &quot;This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="126"> It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example. </seg>
<seg id="127"> California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state&apos;s ambitious global warming laws. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="129"> The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile. </seg>
<seg id="130"> &quot;This is not just a tax going into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason. </seg>
<seg id="131"> People are paying more directly into what they are getting. </seg>
<seg id="132"> The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="134"> But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country&apos;s biggest experiment. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Nevada has already completed a pilot. </seg>
<seg id="139"> New York City is looking into one. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="141"> And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change. </seg>
<seg id="142"> The concept is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="143"> In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers&apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move. </seg>
<seg id="144"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. </seg>
<seg id="145"> It was not something people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="146"> As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals&apos; everyday comings and goings. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time. </seg>
<seg id="149"> If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="151"> The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers. </seg>
<seg id="152"> It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage. </seg>
<seg id="153"> But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don&apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="155"> There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs. </seg>
<seg id="156"> There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this. </seg>
<seg id="157"> In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices. </seg>
<seg id="158"> They can choose a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="161"> In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide &quot;pay-as-you-drive&quot; insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic. </seg>
<seg id="162"> &quot;Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them,&quot; says a city planning document. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction. </seg>
<seg id="164"> At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes. </seg>
<seg id="165"> An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don&apos;t use much gas, so they pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the commission&apos;s director of legislation and public affairs. </seg>
<seg id="167"> If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jagaran Bureau, Shrinagar: The police have allegedly removed the security of the former Minister Ghulam Hasan Khan who joined Congress from the People Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Khan blamed the government, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons. </seg>
<seg id="170"> It may be recalled that in the year 2002 Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the 2002 elections from Shopian on a PDP ticket, was included in the cabinet, while Mufti Mohamed Sayeed was a Chief Minister. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Ghulam Hassan Khan said he has had protection since 1996. </seg>
<seg id="172"> I live in Shopian, which is believed to be a stronghold of terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="173"> A CRPF security team under the leadership of a sub-inspector is stationed at my house. </seg>
<seg id="174"> I have also bodyguards, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="175"> As when the security team was leaving from my house I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District Superintendent. </seg>
<seg id="176"> But instead of restoring security they just said that they would investigate the matter. </seg>
<seg id="177"> However, in this regard, when the Kashmir IGP, Abdul Gani Meer, was contacted he denied any knowledge of the issue and said that it was a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I should check it out myself. After all, how can the protection of a former minister and senior political leader be removed? </seg>
<seg id="179"> The State Congress Chief, Prof. Safudin Soz, said that as far as he knew  nothing of this kind had ever happened before. </seg>
<seg id="180"> If Hasan Khan&apos;s security has been compromised, then it is a very serious matter. </seg>
<seg id="181"> I am in Jammu now and will be coming to Kashmir in a day or two. </seg>
<seg id="182"> I will discuss this issue with the authorities concerned. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Land Rover rally series announced </seg>
<seg id="184"> The interior has racing seats and six-point harness belts, as well as an intercom system. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Options include upgraded brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistic support, and vehicle storage between events. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Drew Bowler, the managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="187"> They&apos;re not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure, and an achievable path towards world-class events. </seg>
<seg id="188"> We&apos;re delighted to be offering this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas, and prepare entrants for the rigours and realities of Rally Raid. </seg>
<seg id="189"> We&apos;ve really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it&apos;ll be a really fun championship. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Additionally, the Defender Challenge will provide a training and test day in February, as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="191"> CDC issues children&apos;s allergy guidelines for schools </seg>
<seg id="192"> On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children&apos;s food allergies at school. </seg>
<seg id="193"> This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs. </seg>
<seg id="194"> One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007. </seg>
<seg id="196"> The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children&apos;s food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur. </seg>
<seg id="197"> It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. </seg>
<seg id="198"> State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Kids may say, &quot;It feels like something is poking my tongue,&quot; &quot;My tongue feels like there is hair on it,&quot; or &quot;My tongue is tingling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="201"> Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now </seg>
<seg id="202"> Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices. </seg>
<seg id="203"> The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot;airplane&quot; mode. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings. </seg>
<seg id="205"> Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="207"> &quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; it said &quot; The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="208"> Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator. </seg>
<seg id="209"> &quot;We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes,&quot; a spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now. </seg>
<seg id="211"> &quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that,&quot; it said. </seg>
<seg id="212"> The FAA ruling applies to American airlines. </seg>
<seg id="213"> However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA&apos;s decision and the reasons behind it. </seg>
<seg id="214"> For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings. </seg>
<seg id="216"> &quot;Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes,&quot; the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing. </seg>
<seg id="218"> The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing. </seg>
<seg id="219"> 42 selected senior leaders of the state BJP unit gave him a grand reception at the airport. </seg>
<seg id="220"> It is noteworthy that Modi was here on a consolation tour in Bihar organised by the BJP. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The consolation tour was an exercise organised by the BJP to console the families of the victims of the Patna bomb blasts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> It is noteworthy that a total of 7 bomb blasts occurred one after the other during Narendra Modi&apos;s Hunkaar rally on October 27th. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the bombings had intended to cause a stampede during the rally, so that more people would die and to spread panic in the state. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The terrorists intentions were thwarted but six people died in the blasts. </seg>
<seg id="225"> They all have been declared to be martyrs by the BJP. </seg>
<seg id="226"> An urn tour was organized from their village by the party leaders on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Their remains were buried in the Ganges in Patna on November 5th. </seg>
<seg id="228"> The consolation tour was a part of this tour. </seg>
<seg id="229"> The main player in this was Narendra Modi. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He will be going to the villages of the people killed in the bomb blasts to meet the families. </seg>
<seg id="231"> During this meeting and visit he will be donating cheques worth five lakh rupees to each family of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="232"> This financial aid has been already announced by the BJP. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Claiming to be a trading firm the accused opened accounts for investors and in the name of selling and purchasing shares, committed fraud. </seg>
<seg id="234"> It is possibly the first time in the state that this type of fraud, worth crores of rupees, has been discovered and exposed. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The police have not yet been able to catch the leader of the gang, but the police have detained seven people including the accused, after examining his work in the state. </seg>
<seg id="236"> This gang ran a fictitious commodity market named Metatrader-5. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Company executives used to take cash from investors and with the help of bogus software used to create fake IDs. </seg>
<seg id="238"> With these, the accused could see the shares the investors were buying. </seg>
<seg id="239"> They also used to known which shares were being purchased and at what price. </seg>
<seg id="240"> In reality no shares were purchased, nor any transactions carried out, because no DEMAT account was opened for the investors and share prices were falsely displayed in the fictitious software. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Police estimate that hundreds of people had been defrauded by the gang. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Every investor was asked to invest from two to five lakhs to get good returns. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The main suspect, Amit Soni, was detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while his six associates were arrested in Indore. </seg>
<seg id="244"> According to the cyber cell ADG, Ashok Dohare, every stock trading company has to join the Stock Exchange as a trading firm. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Only after that can the company can get investors to do stock trading through them. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Then the investor&apos;s DEMAT account is opened, so that the stock can be traded, but this company MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange, nor was carrying out any stock trading. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This company purchased a server on 24th September 2012 under the name of Wintrade. </seg>
<seg id="248"> Since then this company has been defrauding people with fake investments. </seg>
<seg id="249"> So far, eight traders from Indore have come forward with complaints to the cyber cell. </seg>
<seg id="250"> After selling their shares at a profit the amount was not transferred into their accounts. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Then they started asking for the promised profit from the executives of the company. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Investors are even saying that their fake IDs always showed a reduction in the price of their purchased shares. </seg>
<seg id="253"> This price was set by the accused themselves. </seg>
<seg id="254"> The company had appointed a CEO and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The agents lured people to join the company with promises of very good returns. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Thereafter, some people invested between two to five lakh rupees. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in the US spying has gone too far, in some cases. </seg>
<seg id="258"> He also claimed that innocent people have been tortured under secret surveillance programs. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Kerry&apos;s confession came while addressing the Open Government Partnership&apos;s annual summit in London via a video link. </seg>
<seg id="260"> Kerry said, &quot;I assure you that innocent people were not being harassed in this process&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="261"> But, in an effort to gain information, in some cases inappropriate methods had been used. </seg>
<seg id="262"> Meanwhile, a key committee of the U.S. Congress has approved a bill to limit the monitoring activities of the National Security Agency [NSA]. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The aim of this is to make monitoring more transparent and to get back the trust of the people which has been lost following the disclosure of large scale phone tapping. </seg>
<seg id="264"> This move by the Senate was welcomed by six U.S. companies including Google and Yahoo. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The data centres in these companies have also been hacked by the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="266"> On Friday the select committee of the Senate passed a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act(FISA)by 11 votes to 4. </seg>
<seg id="267"> Many restrictions, including an outright ban on phone tapping, have been proposed in this bill, under the American Patriot Act. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Deliberate, unauthorized collection and use of data under FISA will be treated as a criminal offence and will be punishable by up to ten years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Once both Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate pass the bill, it will become law. </seg>
<seg id="270"> The Committee Chairman and Senator, Diane Festin, said that the NSA&apos;s program of recording phone calls is within the law, and believed it had contributed significantly to the country&apos;s security. </seg>
<seg id="271"> However, there should be more transparency. </seg>
<seg id="272"> Not only that, the protection of personal privacy should also be kept in mind. </seg>
<seg id="273"> Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook, disturbed by the revelation of the NSA&apos;s Internet surveillance program, have supported this bill. </seg>
<seg id="274"> In letters written to the senators all these companies have said that the senators&apos; proposal to restrict the NSA&apos;s large scale phone tapping is welcomed by them. </seg>
<seg id="275"> It is noteworthy that the documents released by the former CIA employee Edward Snowden made the actions of the NSA public. </seg>
<seg id="276"> The NSA&apos;s monitoring of the phone conversations of the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France, had caused a huge uproar in the international community. </seg>
<seg id="277"> John Kerry says US spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately&quot; in unprecedented admission </seg>
<seg id="278"> John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S&apos;s defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> The Secretary of State also admitted that he&apos;d been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA&apos;s spying activities emerged. </seg>
<seg id="280"> The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies. </seg>
<seg id="281"> Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="282"> He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one&apos;s rights had been abused. </seg>
<seg id="283"> He said: &quot;In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse. </seg>
<seg id="285"> I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="287"> He added: &quot;We&apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="288"> There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments. </seg>
<seg id="289"> So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens? </seg>
<seg id="290"> We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we&apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency. </seg>
<seg id="293"> &quot;It&apos;s really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors,&quot; Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="294"> And I&apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="295"> News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency&apos;s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="296"> Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders. </seg>
<seg id="297"> The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it&apos;s commonplace on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days. </seg>
<seg id="300"> He said the itinerary is still being worked out. </seg>
<seg id="301"> While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some &quot;tough love&quot; will also be dispensed. </seg>
<seg id="302"> He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they&apos;ve used for years themselves. </seg>
<seg id="303"> &quot;While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we&apos;re not the only ones that are out there spying,&quot; Murphy said. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities. </seg>
<seg id="305"> NSA Blames &quot;Internal Error,&quot; Not Hackers, For Website Crash </seg>
<seg id="306"> The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement. </seg>
<seg id="308"> The issue will be resolved this evening. </seg>
<seg id="309"> Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA&apos;s website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency&apos;s internal, sensitive network was &quot;not at all&quot; compromised. </seg>
<seg id="312"> No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said. </seg>
<seg id="313"> At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack. </seg>
<seg id="314"> DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses. </seg>
<seg id="315"> The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight&apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Fire crews called to rescue lost puppy after she got stuck 50ft above the ground on precarious ledge in a quarry </seg>
<seg id="319"> Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash </seg>
<seg id="320"> She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry </seg>
<seg id="321"> Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death </seg>
<seg id="322"> A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. </seg>
<seg id="325"> They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident. </seg>
<seg id="326"> At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up. </seg>
<seg id="327"> A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: &apos;She was in a precarious situation. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom. </seg>
<seg id="330"> She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid. </seg>
<seg id="331"> But she is fine now. </seg>
<seg id="332"> She was eating biscuits afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="333"> This was a very unusual call-out. </seg>
<seg id="334"> The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby had a very lucky escape.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;Watching the rescue was terrifying.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="339"> I could not believe that she was up there in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="340"> It was amazing to get her back in our arms. </seg>
<seg id="341"> The vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The firefighters were amazing. </seg>
<seg id="343"> It was really daring what they did. </seg>
<seg id="344"> We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: &quot;We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="346"> The firefighters were brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="347"> I just can&apos;t believe where she was. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Because of this the plaintiffs had to suffer. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Addressing those gathered for the occasion, the Bar Association President, Ramesh Singh Negi, expressed strong indignation at the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. </seg>
<seg id="350"> He said that the growing number of attacks on the advocates and their families shows that the criminals have become fearless. </seg>
<seg id="351"> They are not afraid of the police and administration system any more. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Citing various such attacks taking place at different places he said that, if the lawyers themselves are not safe, then we can surely understand how much less safe is the general pubic. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage </seg>
<seg id="354"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can. </seg>
<seg id="356"> The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="357"> Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they&apos;re at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&apos;Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance. </seg>
<seg id="359"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to charge that,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> O&apos;Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money. </seg>
<seg id="364"> It&apos;s about Frontier&apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline&apos;s website won&apos;t have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="366"> That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag. </seg>
<seg id="367"> O&apos;Malley said Frontier&apos;s website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Frontier&apos;s new carry-on fee won&apos;t start until summer, though a date hasn&apos;t been set. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="370"> They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Most haven&apos;t touched carry-on bag fees, though. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary&apos;s Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees. </seg>
<seg id="375"> He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit&apos;s carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="376"> Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he&apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit&apos;s unusual carry-on bag fee. </seg>
<seg id="377"> &quot;The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="378"> I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The plane was full, he said, &quot;and it boarded lickety-split.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="380"> Frontier is also following Spirit&apos;s $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free. </seg>
<seg id="382"> It will still give away water. </seg>
<seg id="383"> US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Frontier&apos;s move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don&apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="386"> That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though. </seg>
<seg id="388"> In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="389"> On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip. </seg>
<seg id="390"> So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="391"> It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="394"> Republic has been trying to fix Frontier&apos;s finances as part of selling the airline. </seg>
<seg id="395"> China plea paper &apos;to be overhauled&apos; </seg>
<seg id="396"> A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says. </seg>
<seg id="397"> The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou. </seg>
<seg id="398"> But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company. </seg>
<seg id="399"> Now the New Express is to undergo &quot;full rectification,&quot; the regulator said. </seg>
<seg id="400"> The &quot;rectification&quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television. </seg>
<seg id="401"> A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group&apos;s New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;New Express&apos;s editorial management was disordered,&quot; the regulator said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It said it had decided to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter&apos;s license.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="404"> It had also &quot;instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express&apos;s leadership team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="405"> Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion. </seg>
<seg id="406"> After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism. </seg>
<seg id="407"> But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money. </seg>
<seg id="408"> &quot;In this case I&apos;ve caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public&apos;s trust,&quot; he told state broadcaster CCTV. </seg>
<seg id="409"> I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame. </seg>
<seg id="410"> I&apos;ve realised my wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Following Mr Chen&apos;s apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves. </seg>
<seg id="414"> To achieve their set targets the Income-Tax Department has plans to start a campaign for collecting advance tax from tax payers. </seg>
<seg id="415"> More than 100 NGOs, along with the Executive Management committee of the Mahabodhi Temple, declared a World Heritage centre, were sent notices by the Department. </seg>
<seg id="416"> School students are also future tax payers. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The official have started reaching out to them too. </seg>
<seg id="418"> The Gaya Zone Deputy Director Saurabh Kumar Rai announced details of the departmental action plan on Tuesday to &apos;Jagaran&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The Deputy Director said that the target for the current financial year was around Rs. 9 crores. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Out of which 40 percent will be obtained through TDS and TCS. </seg>
<seg id="421"> There are many sources from which to collect the remaining amount. </seg>
<seg id="422"> He said an appeal is being made to tax payers to pay their advance taxes. </seg>

<seg id="451"> The players in this team are setting new test match records everyday and now their reputation in one day tournaments is also increasing. </seg>
<seg id="452"> An excellent example of this was when a strong New Zealand team was crushed by Bangladesh, who had an insurmountable lead and won the one-day series title. </seg>
<seg id="453"> With Sohag Gazi and Musherfe Murtaza&apos;s strong bowling Bangladesh defeated New Zealand in the second one-day match by 40 runs and gained a insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. </seg>
<seg id="454"> This is Bangladesh&apos;s sixth consecutive win in one-day matches against New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Before this, New Zealand had lost the 2010 series to Bangladesh by 0-4. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Chasing a target of 248 runs set by Bangladesh, the New Zealand team lost wickets at regular intervals. The team had piled on 207 runs in 46.4 overs from the spin bowling of Ghazi (34/3) and the strong bowling of Murtaza (43/3). </seg>
<seg id="457"> New Zealand&apos;s Ross Taylor made the highest score of 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37 runs. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Kyle Mills made 27 not-out, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but many of the team&apos;s batsmen could not convert the good start into a big innings score, so the team were defeated. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Earlier, the Bangladesh team was all out for 247 runs after 49 overs in spite of Tamim Iqbal&apos;s (58) half century. </seg>

<seg id="466"> Moti Nagar police have registered a case against the accused. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Police commissioner Paramjit Singh said that those arrested and accused are Haiboval Rajiv Agarwal a.k.a. Bintu from Chandan Nagar, from Ghumar Mandi, Kamal Krushna Jaiswal, Gurwinder Singh Jaggi from Kohada and Sonu from Ghumar Mandi. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Balbir Singh from the Registrar Office (East) has fled from the scene. </seg>
<seg id="469"> According to the police the accused used to take out the documents of the records of vacant and old plots with the help of Balbir Singh, a clerk and record keeper in the Registrar Office and then, by purchasing new stamp papers, used to make counterfeit registration documents for them. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Not only that, but they used to destroy the original registry documents and then the false registry documents were updated in the records. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Then the accused use to sell the land with counterfeit papers for crores of rupees. </seg>
<seg id="472"> At the same time, they would take out loans against these counterfeit documents. </seg>
<seg id="473"> Thereafter, the original owner would be left running to the police and administration. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Those accused of the counterfeit registrations were especially intersted in the NRIG plots. </seg>
<seg id="475"> As no-one was looking after the NRIG plots. </seg>
<seg id="476"> So it was easy to forge registration documents and sell the land. </seg>
<seg id="477"> The Police Commissioner said that, upon interrogation, the accused said that they had made about 150 counterfeit registrations so far. </seg>
<seg id="478"> According to police Rajiv, the leader of the gang, already has a criminal record for fraud and theft. </seg>

<seg id="481"> Saying many of the myths would be &quot;far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools,&quot; Crossley-Holland advocated a &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate works. </seg>
<seg id="482"> &quot;I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="483"> I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="484"> He added authors and teachers being &quot;overtly didactic&quot; is a &quot;total switch-off&quot; for children, with messages being &quot;subliminated&quot; in enjoyable stories. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: &quot;You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="486"> Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil. </seg>

<seg id="496"> If the comparative results would come out, the question of whether the BJP government should rule or not would not arise in the country. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Whenever and wherever the BJP government was formed they tried to meet the people&apos;s aspirations. </seg>
<seg id="498"> This country is witness to the fact that during the governments led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai inflation was low. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The poor man ate twice a day. </seg>
<seg id="500"> But when the government was formed by Congress or its supporters then the poor man could not get enough food. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Not one Congress leader, not one leader of the UPA, can tell us what they have done in nine and a half years. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Our country&apos;s media also cannot talk to them. </seg>
<seg id="503"> Congress has become egoistical. </seg>

<seg id="517"> Due to which the number of cases of violations of the code of conduct are declining. </seg>
<seg id="518"> After the implementation of the election code of conduct between October 4th to October 21st, 313 cases were lodged against various political parties. </seg>
<seg id="519"> While only 31 cases were registered between October 22nd and October 27th. </seg>
<seg id="520"> With the implementation of the election code of conduct cases of its violation were also being reported. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Initially there were many complaints, but gradually they are becoming fewer. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is being said that, as no-one had full information about the code of conduct, the number of complaints registered against the political parties was rising. </seg>
<seg id="523"> As the election commission made the political parties aware of them and asked them to learn a lesson from the registered complaints the complaints have reduced. </seg>
<seg id="524"> Many parties were campaigning in an old fashioned manner because of a lack of information, but when action was taken against them they stopped doing that. </seg>
<seg id="525"> The political parties are learning about the election code of conduct and are also complying with it. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Due to this the number of cases of code violation have declined. </seg>

<seg id="530"> On Friday, while addressing a press conference here, V.K. Sood said that, after the municipal corporation elections the city got a new councillor and mayor, but they do not have the powers necessary to get the work done. </seg>
<seg id="531"> So the city councillors have become dummies and officers are doing as they pleased. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Sood said that the municipal corporation has crores of rupees at its disposal, but all the money is in the form of Bank FDs and interest is being earned on it. </seg>
<seg id="533"> So no steps are being taken to use that money for the development of the city. </seg>
<seg id="534"> V.K. Sood said the refuse dump issue is the most serious problem. </seg>
<seg id="535"> By creating a dump in Sector 23, people living in sectors beyond Ghaggar are forced to live a hellish life. </seg>
<seg id="536"> The municipal corporation officers have been talking about shifting the dump to the village of Jhuriwala for the past several years now, but the inhabitants of the Barwala area are already facing a serious problem with flies. </seg>

<seg id="538"> No work has yet been started to provide facilities for rural inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="539"> The 77 year old former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, known for his Bunga Bunga parties, has married a 28 year old girl in an extremely secretive manner. </seg>
<seg id="540"> This was revealed by a family friend, Marythell Polanco. </seg>
<seg id="541"> According to her, the three times Prime Minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascale in his private chapel. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Francisca met Berlusconi when she was a teenage activist with the Forza Italia Party. </seg>
<seg id="543"> This is the same Francisca, about whom it has been said that her relationship with Berlusconi is a sham. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Berlusconi&apos;s close friend and the Bunga Bunga Girl Marythell Polanco revealed that she was also invited to this secret wedding. </seg>
<seg id="545"> This ceremony took place three weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="546"> During the revelation on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if those two were to get married, Polanco replied that they are already married. </seg>
<seg id="547"> This was not a public ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="548"> This wedding was held in the chapel at the former Prime Minister&apos;s home. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Other than this, no one can say anything more. </seg>
<seg id="550"> However, she did not go to the wedding. </seg>
<seg id="551"> She had sent her best wishes to the newlyweds. </seg>
<seg id="552"> They got married about three weeks ago on October 8th or 9th. </seg>
<seg id="553"> He got engaged about 8 months ago to the 28 year old woman, Francesca Pascale, who is 50 years younger than him. </seg>
<seg id="554"> To avoid embarrassment, Berlusconi claimed loneliness as the reason for his decision to marry. </seg>
<seg id="555"> The Due-guard company presented a water purifier to the Naya Nangal Temple of Lord Valmiki, for safe drinking water. </seg>
<seg id="556"> After receiving the water purifier from the company representatives J.K. Kaushik and Khushbu Kaushik, the Temple president Virendra Adiya said that this social act was very commendable, because now all the worshippers coming to the temple could enjoy clean drinking water. </seg>
<seg id="557"> Currently in judicial custody at the Central Jail on charges of sexual abuse of a minor, the student Asaram will spend his Diwali in jail this time. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also a suspect in the case of the rape of a girl in Surat. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Meanwhile, his son Narayan Sai is on the run from the police. </seg>
<seg id="560"> And so now an arrest warrant has been issued for him by the Gujarat police. </seg>
<seg id="561"> From Ahmedabad a report is also coming in that Asaram&apos;s trustees are also slowly breaking away from Asaram. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Further action is now also being taken on Asaram&apos;s ashrams that have been built illegally or on public land. </seg>
<seg id="563"> We have already informed you that Asaram is the owner of more than 400 Ashrams. </seg>
<seg id="564"> Amongst these is one ashram in New Jersey, USA. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Asaram and his son are accused of various crimes. </seg>
<seg id="566"> In spite of this, the blind faith of some of their devotees continues. </seg>
<seg id="567"> Asaram has a following not only in India, but also equally in America. </seg>
<seg id="568"> Here in India, Asaram is in jail and his devotees are slowly breaking away from him, but this is not at all the case in America. </seg>
<seg id="569"> In the New Jersey ashram even now the devotees continue to come as before and pray to Asaram. </seg>
<seg id="570"> Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog&apos;s tail are linked to its mood. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog&apos;s point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. </seg>
<seg id="572"> But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. </seg>
<seg id="573"> The study is published in the journal Current Biology. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: &quot;It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> Here we attempted to look at it in other species. </seg>
<seg id="576"> He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions. </seg>
<seg id="577"> To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="578"> They measured the pets&apos; heart rates and analysed their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="579"> It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other </seg>
<seg id="580"> Prof Vallortigara said: &quot;We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="581"> When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog&apos;s point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="582"> But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog&apos;s point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Prof Vallortigara said he didn&apos;t think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn&apos;t feel worried about. </seg>
<seg id="585"> He said: &quot;If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="586"> The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal&apos;s emotions. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol&apos;s school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="589"> And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos;tail&apos; was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="590"> He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines. </seg>
<seg id="591"> A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other. </seg>
<seg id="594"> New research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning hours. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Thoughts of lying to anyone and theft or cheating someone do not enter our heads. </seg>
<seg id="596"> But as the evening comes, our minds change and we set aside our principles and we go against the accepted norms. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In research carried out by Harvard University and the David Axle School of Business, Utah, researchers have revealed some interesting facts. </seg>
<seg id="598"> According to researchers, while we don&apos;t have work pressure in the morning we attach importance to moral values, but as the evening sets in, due to fatigue or extra pressure our honesty declines. </seg>
<seg id="599"> To test this researchers did two experiments. </seg>
<seg id="600"> They asked some subjects to count the number of dots on a computer screen. </seg>
<seg id="601"> For example, subjects had to say if the dots were more on the right or left-hand side. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Participants were then told that if they give the wrong answer rather than the correct answer they would be given money. </seg>
<seg id="603"> This experiment shows that those who took part in the experiment in the morning between 8 and 12 did not make any mistakes and they gave the correct answers. </seg>
<seg id="604"> At the same time, those who took part in the experiment between 12 noon and 6pm set aside their morals and intentionally gave wrong answers. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Researchers have succeeded in proving that in the morning the greed for money does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we chose to ignore morality. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The research is published in the current issue of Psychological Science. </seg>
<seg id="607"> The Gate City Hall Circle Office, that earns crores of rupees every day for the Punjab State Power Corporation, is housed in an old ruin of a building. </seg>
<seg id="608"> All the employees are forced to work in fear of accidents. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Plaster falling from the ceiling everyday has caused panic among the staff. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Built in 1913, this British-era building was the Municipal Corporation&apos;s first office. </seg>
<seg id="611"> In 1995 the building was handed over to the Power Board. </seg>
<seg id="612"> The department just did some painting by way of repairs. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The building has deteriorated to the extent that employees are afraid of working in it. </seg>
<seg id="614"> The building&apos;s condition is so poor that often plaster falls from the ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="615"> In the past month, plaster has fallen from the ceiling in four rooms. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Because of this a female employee was injured. </seg>
<seg id="617"> The JE and Revenue accountant narrowly escaped injury in this accident. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Currently nearly four hundred employees work in the building. </seg>
<seg id="619"> These include the SE along with 5 Ex.Ens., 12 SDOs, 20 Junior Engineers, 130 Clerical staff, 200 Technical Workers and 20 other staff members. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Even though the situation is so bad, the PowerCom top officials have taken no steps to secure their safety so far. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Three rooms allotted to the JEs, for scooter and cycle parking, and two rooms on the upper floor of the building have complete collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="622"> The state of the building can easily be assessed by these facts. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip </seg>
<seg id="624"> Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot;attractive special adviser,&quot; Hannah Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="626"> The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby&apos;s voicemails and &quot;door-stepped&quot; her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard. </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people&apos;s houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say,&quot; Mr Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="629"> The editor is personally involved in the third. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do. </seg>
<seg id="631"> What about the first? </seg>
<seg id="632"> Does he know about phone hacking? </seg>
<seg id="633"> He says he doesn&apos;t, we say &quot;Oh yes, he did&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW&apos;s features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: &quot;Don&apos;t bother wasting your time, she&apos;s with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire&apos;s home in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Investigators also found entries on the private investigator&apos;s computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as &quot;Projects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="637"> During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby&apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby&apos;s movements. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: &quot;I&apos;ve got a story that we&apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="640"> Mr Edis said Coulson&apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett. </seg>
<seg id="641"> The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006. </seg>
<seg id="643"> Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking. </seg>
<seg id="644"> When the exciting Indian team plays at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium after their spectacular win in the last match for the seventh and last one-day against Australia, they will be aiming to win this match and win the series. </seg>
<seg id="645"> After rains washed out the last two one-day matches, they had to win the Nagpur one-day for India to remain in the series, and its batsmen played an amazing game and had a record win, levelling the series at 2-2. </seg>
<seg id="646"> In this series team India has achieved the target of 350 or more runs twice and once again the responsibility to save the team lies with the batsmen. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Indian batting is at its peak now and even the bigger targets seem small to them. </seg>
<seg id="648"> Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohile and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team also has high expectations of Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja. </seg>
<seg id="649"> As far as opening is concerned, the opening pair of Rohit and Shikhar is making the job easier for the other batsmen, with their strong partnership. </seg>
<seg id="650"> They gave Virat the opportunity to bat without any pressure in Jaipur and Nagpur with their remarkable opening partnership. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Given the great performance by Virat up until now at No.3, he is being seen as the future Sachin Tendulkar. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Actually, a lot of cricket greats have said that he is better than Sachin. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Virat, who is completing 25 years next week, has scored 17 one-day centuries out of which 16 have lead to an Indian victory. </seg>
<seg id="654"> While chasing a target his average is above 80 and he has emerged as a excellent finisher. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The top three batmen of India are in great form, but too much reliance on these three can also be damaging for the team. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Raina and Yuvraj were very bog flops in the last match. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Yuvraj could not even open his account in the two matches of the series. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Because of this, a good innings at the Bengaluru one-day would be a &apos;lifeline&apos; for him. </seg>
<seg id="659"> As far as Australia team is concerned, their batsmen especially Captain George Bailey, has impressed everyone with his performances. </seg>
<seg id="660"> There has been demand to include him in the Home Ashes test team against England. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Australia has good batsmen up to number nine. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Besides of Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Although Phil Hugh and Eron Finch haven&apos;t been able to make an impression at the opening. </seg>
<seg id="664"> However, the absence of bowler Michael Johnson could make things difficult. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Johnson, who had been performing well until now in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series. </seg>
<seg id="666"> The dream of firecracker traders of doing good business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not realised. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The firecracker traders are trapped in a dilemma after the High court&apos;s order. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Neither can they do business in the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses to do business in the Transport area. </seg>
<seg id="669"> After its visit to the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue the commission, appointed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, had declared it unsafe. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Since no appropriate arrangements were made there, the Deputy commissioner was fined ten lakh Rupees. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The High Court strongly criticised the Amritsar administration in its order and questioned the use of such an administration that could not even resolve such a small issue as that of the firecracker traders over a period of the 9 years. </seg>
<seg id="672"> No proper place has been allotted to them in the city. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Thereafter, they were asked to provide appropriate and safe facilities and to issue the licenses for selling firecrackers in Jahajgarh market itself. </seg>
<seg id="674"> After this order the firecracker traders were happy but the police poured cold water on their joy on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="675"> The firearm license branch team arrived in the firecracker market and set up a counter selling forms. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The necessary terms and conditions involved, could not possibly be met in one day. </seg>
<seg id="677"> ASP East Gaurav Garg, Firearms License Branch chief, Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanvind Arun Sharma also went to the firecracker market. </seg>
<seg id="678"> They expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders. </seg>
<seg id="679"> So the licenses were not issued to the firecracker traders. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Diwali is just one day away. </seg>
<seg id="681"> For this reason the firecracker vendors were worried. </seg>
<seg id="682"> The loss of crores of rupees seemed inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="683"> Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said that if they lost a large amount of money they would sue the district administration. </seg>
<seg id="684"> On Friday night the angry firecracker traders went on a protest march from Jahajgarh to Ranjeet Avenue. </seg>
<seg id="685"> The shouted slogans against the police and the administration. </seg>
<seg id="686"> Thereafter the business in the temporary firecracker market at Ranjeet Avenue was also stopped. </seg>
<seg id="687"> Samvaad Associate, Ghumaarvi: the head constable, Om Prakash, retired after serving the Police Department for 32 years in Ghumaarvi. </seg>
<seg id="688"> To celebrate the occasion the employees and officers of the Police Department organised a farewell party. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Om Prakash is a resident of Bhapral village in Bhapral gram panchayat. </seg>
<seg id="690"> He served very well throughout his entire tenure. </seg>
<seg id="691"> It&apos;s true that we cannot even move without money. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Money is one of the most important requirements for survival, but considering it as the most important thing is not in our best interest. </seg>
<seg id="693"> We celebrate Dhanteras on  Krishna Trayodashi in the month of Kartika. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Kuber, the lord of wealth, and Yama, the lord of death Yama are worshipped during Dhanteras. </seg>
<seg id="695"> Money plays an important part in our religion and life. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Money is neither good nor bad. </seg>
<seg id="697"> It is our attitude towards money that is good or bad. </seg>
<seg id="698"> There is nothing more valuable than wealth that is used for the well-being of mankind, but if wealth becomes the cause of ego, then it is of no value. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Wealth should be earned with a sacred objective and should also be spent on sacred objectives. </seg>
<seg id="700"> It is the duty of everyone to earn money for the well-being of the family. </seg>
<seg id="701"> There should also be some sense of social expenditure, but the tendency to the unlimited accumulation or creation of wealth by any means can be bad for our conscience and personality. </seg>
<seg id="702"> There should always be a spirit of charity on our minds. </seg>
<seg id="703"> Even a fraction of your wealth, given by you, can become the basis of someone&apos;s livelihood. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Many people in society are living in extreme poverty. We all must think about them. </seg>
<seg id="705"> In fact wealth, religion, desire and salvation have been given equal importance in all walks of life. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Everyone wishes for wealth and success and depending on how hard they work they achieve wealth and success. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Only wealth gained with self-respect is long lasting. </seg>
<seg id="708"> No criminal, no matter how wealthy he becomes, can never enjoy his wealth in the correct manner and nor can he be useful to others. </seg>
<seg id="709"> Do not envy someone who has money. </seg>
<seg id="710"> True wealthy is the one which makes it possible for wealth to flow through numerous hands. </seg>
<seg id="711"> There is no more appropriate use for wealth than that of creating jobs for others. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Also bear in mind, wealth does not come only in the form of money. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Health, character and love for others is also a kind of wealth. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Try to gain possession of this kind of wealth. </seg>
<seg id="715"> The human population has exceeded 7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="716"> If the population continues to increase this way, the time will soon come when mustering a morsel for every hungry mouth would be very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="717"> According to experts, in the near future people will have no other option but to eat worms and insects. </seg>
<seg id="718"> According to reports, this year a group of students from McGill University in Montreal received the Hult Prize for an innovative project. </seg>
<seg id="719"> They were given the award for making protein flour from worms and insects. </seg>
<seg id="720"> A $1 million grant was awarded to them to make it possible for them to pursue their research and experiments. </seg>
<seg id="721"> In an interview with ABC News on September 30th, the Group Chief Student Researcher, Mohammed Ashor, said that his team will experiment with grasshoppers for food. </seg>
<seg id="722"> This report has an detailed description of edible worms and insects. </seg>
<seg id="723"> The special Task Force (STF) exposed the fraud in the 2012 PMT just a day ago. </seg>
<seg id="724"> The STF found discrepancies in the enrolment numbers of 700 students. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Amongst them almost 125 students had been admitted into medical college. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Now these students admissions will be declared void. </seg>
<seg id="727"> After the STF&apos;s revelation the medical examination department has started considering cancelling these students&apos; admissions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> According to the information provided the department is waiting for a complete list of all suspect students from the STF. </seg>
<seg id="729"> The list will be sent to the PEB to revoke the eligibility of the students involved. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Although, in this case, the department is also thinking of taking legal advice. </seg>
<seg id="731"> The departmental officials said that the students enrolled in 2012 have completed one year, so taking legal advice is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="732"> As the case is now under an STF enquiry, Department of Medical Education officials are not in a position to make a statement. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The PEB director, Tarun Pithore, said, &quot;If the STF provides us the list of suspected students with proof, then their admission would be cancelled immediately&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The Director of Medical Education, Dr.Nirbhay Srivastava, also said, &quot;If the students&apos; admissions were found to be forged, we would cancel their admissions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="735"> According to STF officials the forged student admissions included in the PMT for the year 2012 are under investigation. </seg>
<seg id="736"> After the investigation a list of the suspected students will be given to the PEB. </seg>
<seg id="737"> It is noteworthy that in the PMT exams for the year 2013 the eligibility of 345 suspect students was rescinded. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Out of these 345, the Department of Medical Education has already rescinded 84 student admissions. </seg>
<seg id="739"> New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="741"> A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good. </seg>
<seg id="743"> &quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches,&quot; Prof Cornell said. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="747"> In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity. </seg>
<seg id="748"> But mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot;chilled out,&quot; say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains. </seg>
<seg id="749"> The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="751"> The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="752"> But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="754"> But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit. </seg>
<seg id="755"> &quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="756"> British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed. </seg>
<seg id="757"> The fans of German-American Model Heidi Klum were shocked at what she had done. </seg>
<seg id="758"> The heart-throb of many young men, Heidi was seen in such a manner it was difficult to recognise her. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The signs of ageing on her face and entire body were so dramatic that her fans were astonished when they first saw her. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The occasion was a Halloween party and Heidi had dressed up in such a way that people who saw her were in shock and were also were very impressed by the amazing change she had undergone. </seg>
<seg id="761"> The pictures of the premature ageing of Heidi are a hot topic on the internet and an Oscar winning team of makeup artistes had given Heidi this new look for the 14th Halloween Festival. </seg>
<seg id="762"> This 40 year super model looked like an 80 or 90 year old and at the event she was wearing a skirt suit and it would not be wrong to say that her face and expression really looked old. </seg>
<seg id="763"> As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland. </seg>
<seg id="765"> Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years. </seg>
<seg id="769"> And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since. </seg>
<seg id="771"> His mother Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee are a great double act.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="772"> They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette. </seg>
<seg id="773"> It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won. </seg>
<seg id="774"> Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him. </seg>
<seg id="775"> The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Mrs Howells said: &quot;The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="777"> He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after. </seg>
<seg id="779"> The way he has started he&apos;ll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll do well. </seg>
<seg id="780"> A spokesman for the annual horse show said: &quot;Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="781"> They are a great team together. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring. </seg>
<seg id="783"> They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring. </seg>
<seg id="784"> I&apos;m sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part. </seg>
<seg id="785"> UN hails new goals to tackle poverty </seg>

<seg id="860"> Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Mr Cook said: &quot;Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="863"> Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year. </seg>
<seg id="864"> Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning &quot;domestic market&quot; with the city&apos;s south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills. </seg>
<seg id="865"> As Diwali is approaching the demand for desserts has increased. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Because of this, the sale of substandard and counterfeit milk solids has increased. </seg>
<seg id="867"> To make the desserts glossy, colourful and sweet, chemicals that are harmful for the health are being used,. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The Food and Drug Administration Department has launched a campaign against fake milk solids and chemical based desserts. </seg>
<seg id="869"> The department has seized Rs.70 thousand worth of milk solids brought in from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5 thousand worth chum chum from the Quetta Colony. </seg>
<seg id="870"> With the increase in demand of desserts in the market the demand for fake milk solids from Madhya Pradesh has also increased. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The department received a tip off that substandard milk solids were being brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur and stored in soil. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The milk solids were brought from the transport garage to Nagpur. </seg>
<seg id="873"> The milk solids seized by the department were reported to be worth Rs.70 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="874"> No one has claimed the milk solids due to the risk of legal action. </seg>
<seg id="875"> The department has destroyed the same as it was considered unclaimed (unknown). </seg>
<seg id="876"> The department raided Jitendra Caterers in the Quetta Colony and seized chum chum worth around Rs.5 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="877"> A chemical named sodium hydro-sulphate is used to make the chum chum shiny and more lasting. </seg>
<seg id="878"> A sample has been sent to the laboratory. </seg>
<seg id="879"> The joint-commissioner of the department, S.S. Deshmukh, said that the campaign to seize chemical based desserts and substandard or counterfeit milk solids will continue. </seg>
<seg id="880"> The department also said that in the next few days this campaign would intensify. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The consumption of these desserts can cause poisoning. </seg>
<seg id="882"> The department has asked tradesmen to use good milk and milk solids when making desserts. </seg>
<seg id="883"> An appeal has been made on behalf of the department to the public to beware of fake desserts. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Egypt swears in first freely elected president </seg>
<seg id="885"> Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="886"> ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country&apos;s first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="887"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world&apos;s first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt&apos;s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="888"> He took the oath before the court&apos;s 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="889"> &quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="890"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="893"> Derided as the Brotherhood&apos;s uncharismatic &quot;spare tyre,&quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="894"> &quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address. </seg>
<seg id="896"> He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention. </seg>
<seg id="897"> Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance. </seg>
<seg id="898"> His arrival was greeted with chants of, &quot;The army and the people are one hand,&quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university&apos;s main lecture room. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military&apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Morsi&apos;s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="903"> You may not believe it but it is true. </seg>
<seg id="904"> Not only that, but the name of Mission road was changed to the name of the City Legislator, Anjali Kumar. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Actually, the Jharkhand Development Youth Forum had changed the name to express their anger at the bad condition of the roads. </seg>
<seg id="906"> The program was led by the JMM central secretary, Sachchidanand Pandey. </seg>
<seg id="907"> British police serve Assange with extradition notice </seg>
<seg id="908"> Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London and requested asylum. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Scotland Yard said they had served a &quot;surrender notice&quot; on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Scotland Yard has &quot;served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing,&quot; a spokesman said. </seg>
<seg id="913"> He remains in breach of his bail conditions. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges, after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The officers of the department claim that this is the biggest case of TDS theft to date. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The director of the Mall group made payments to all the financial institutions after deducting the TDS, but did not deposit it in the government treasury. </seg>
<seg id="918"> In this way he kept the accumulated TDS amount. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The Mumbai Income Tax team, along with the team from the Jaipur Income tax department, raided this group on October 17th. </seg>
<seg id="920"> During the investigation of this group it was revealed that this businessman had deducted the TDS but had not paid it in. </seg>
<seg id="921"> This is why the TDS team initiated an income tax survey of this group. </seg>
<seg id="922"> About 15 days before, raids and a survey was carried out on the mall&apos;s group of directors, before there was any risk of the accounts being sealed. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Angry with these actions, the businessman clearly told the officers of the income tax department that he is not ready to pay the TDS amount due to the income tax department right now. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The Income tax department is continuing to target him and take action. </seg>
<seg id="925"> In this case the officers have explained that if payment is not made the accounts will be frozen and a recovery procedure will be initiated. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Oil extends drop toward $96 a barrel </seg>
<seg id="927"> The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China&apos;s power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening. </seg>
<seg id="928"> Benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="929"> The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Ample supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels. </seg>
<seg id="933"> But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity. </seg>
<seg id="934"> That suggests China&apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a two-decade low in the previous quarter. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Pawan Bansal attcked by the opposition&apos;s questions on Rail Gate, shocked the opposition by saying that he had not so much as looked at a women in the past 15 years. </seg>
<seg id="937"> After this everyone one was stunned and wondered where the issue of a woman had come from. </seg>
<seg id="938"> Maybe, Bansal was hinting at the family life of a Senior BJP leader and legislator. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Then, changing the subject, Bansal told the reporters that in the last parliamentary elections the BJP had sent a women after him and conspired to lodge a complaint against him, but that they had failed. </seg>
<seg id="940"> Addressing the reporters Bansal said that the CBI had interrogated him in the Rail Corruption case. </seg>
<seg id="941"> If he has called as a witness then it must only have been after a complete investigation. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Bansal said that, in the booth in question, he had only delivered a letter for a needy person. </seg>
<seg id="943"> If that is a crime, he would always commit the crime. </seg>
<seg id="944"> He said that it was not the corporation&apos;s constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, but he himself told the opposition to do so. </seg>
<seg id="945"> He said that as far as the developmental activities were concerned the opposition would be provided with a list of all the developmental activities of the last 15 years. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In Chandigarh they cannot imagine the way in which the development is taking place or will take place. </seg>
<seg id="947"> At the state women&apos;s sport championships Rohtak took first place in Kabbadi. </seg>

<seg id="954"> On the other hand, at the closing ceremony while addressing the players and others present, the ADC R.C. Bidhan said that the players should continue to practice hard with discipline so that they could become great players and bring glory to the country and state. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Empowering women at the state level of women&apos;s sports has proven to be especially effective. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The state level women&apos;s sporting competition began on October 29th in Rohtak, at the Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex and ended on October 31st. </seg>
<seg id="957"> The ADC said that the players will have to demonstrate their skills and exercise discipline to strengthen their abilities with hard work. Only then could they prove their mettle in the future and bring glory to the country and their states. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Hundreds of devotees attended this event. </seg>
<seg id="959"> On the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, the god Hanuman was worshipped on Devika beach. </seg>

<seg id="970"> Once approval is obtained the election date will be announced. </seg>
<seg id="971"> He said it is the responsibility of the college administration to hold elections in other colleges. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Many colleges do not want to hold Student Union elections in their campus. </seg>
<seg id="973"> However, due to the lack of unity among the students, elections were not being held. </seg>
<seg id="974"> The Union organised a petition for elections. </seg>
<seg id="975"> Akash Jaiswal, Division Organiser ABVP </seg>
<seg id="976"> After Diwali permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges. </seg>

<seg id="985"> Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears </seg>
<seg id="986"> Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard. </seg>
<seg id="987"> But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot;never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation,&quot; the Commission was told. </seg>
<seg id="988"> Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="989"> Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one. </seg>
<seg id="990"> He conceded the YMCA&apos;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot;there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="991"> Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management &quot;from myself down&quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches. </seg>
<seg id="993"> Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="994"> He was jailed for a minimum of six years. </seg>
<seg id="995"> But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord&apos;s breaches of child safety. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children&apos;s services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord &quot;very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="998"> The CEO said he did not accept staff&apos;s evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers. </seg>
<seg id="999"> Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; was &quot;not about reporting&quot; by staff, and the board agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children&apos;s services Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The hearing adjourned until December 20. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch </seg>
<seg id="1007"> At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters&quot; school fees. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money&apos;s stuck there,&quot; Mrs Amirthalinga says. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga&apos;s case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> This week Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks&quot; creditworthiness. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> &quot;Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can,&quot; says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state&apos;s 200 pawn outlets are gold. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> &quot;People are saying &quot;the gold price looks good, let&apos;s pawn grandma&apos;s gold chain and get it back next month,&quot;&quot; says Mr Song. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax&apos;s executive director. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> There&apos;s an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> We see customers from all walks of life. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> &quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs,&quot; says Ms Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Sometimes they just need the money very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> People purchased a lot of utensils as well as gold and silver on the occasion of Dhanteras in the capital. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Sales have increased by 20 to 30% since last year. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> People crowded the jewellery shops in Simla. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The utensil shops set up in lower Bajar to Maal road were crowded. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Although inflation had plagued these items, people did not seem to be penny-pinching while purchasing on this auspicious occasion. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> The auspicious times for purchases on Friday were from 7:52 am to 10:12 am, 1:56 pm to 3:37 pm and 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Large crowds gathered in shops on all the three auspicious times in Simla and the suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> There wasn&apos;t even a place to stand for people in the lower bazaar in Simla. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Every shop, large and small, was crowded. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> When the thirteenth day of the Kartik month is celebrated as Dhanteras it is considered to be a sign of a Happy Diwali. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> According to the information received, a resident named Habibullah Malla was walking towards Willow Nursery in Haritara Sopor on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Suddenly he was attacked by a bear. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> He cried for help to fight the bear off. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> By the time the people around him came to his help the bear had badly bitten his face. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> People shouted and threw rocks at the bear. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> Then, the bear left Habibullah and hid in the nursery. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> The villagers took the injured man to hospital. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> $325m rescue package for Tassie health </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania&apos;s ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can&apos;t waste the funds. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state&apos;s aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints. </seg>

<seg id="1059"> An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> There&apos;s also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> &quot;These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania&apos;s health system,&quot; Ms Plibersek said. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little &quot;unless it&apos;s followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania&apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1066"> He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> &quot;I&apos;m hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state&apos;s public health system off the critical list,&quot; Mr Wilkie said. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&apos;s announcement is a &quot;band-aid solution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1070"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system,&quot; he told ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> You can&apos;t have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it&apos;s a good news day. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1074"> On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&apos;s domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1078"> But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> If Europe&apos;s most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> I think it&apos;s conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> &quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies&apos; trade secrets to its own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Business leaders are sceptical about this. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again... </seg>
<seg id="1091"> &quot;That&apos;s not the way,&quot; Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn&apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> Everything but the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: &quot;We see a new question from customers that didn&apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1099"> Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> That economic spying takes place is not a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> It has always taken place. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> &quot;This has been a topic for many years and hasn&apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Germany&apos;s BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> &quot;Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access,&quot; the BfV warns in a report. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: &quot;The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1116"> The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Nobody is fooled. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Huge numbers of participants from Godda, Pakuf, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatara districts took part in the training. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> All the participants were trained in many disciplines over a period of seven days, including pitching tents and erecting flag poles. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Training is being provided with the co-operation of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Roy and Isha Ghosh. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> All the participant helped to spread a sense of unity by taking part in nondenominational prayer sessions. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> The Camp Chief and Commissioner of State Training, Vipin Kumar, is offering special assistance. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The State Media member Ajay Rai said he will begin his extensive campaign on the 4th of November. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Bhagat will be focusing his efforts in the Assembly constituencies in Chhatisgarh, adjacent to Jharkhand. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> He knows these areas very well. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> He will travel in Chhattisgarh continuously until November 16th. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Jharkhandi leaders are in great demand in the electoral battle in Chhattisgarh. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> More than two dozen leaders of the BJP are already there. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Congress had urged the JMM chief, Shibu Soren, and Chief Minister, Hemant Soren, to campaign on behalf of the party in Chhattisgarh, which JMM&apos;s top leadership has accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> The JMM withdrew its 10 candidates announced earlier from the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> The JMM has told the Chhatisgarh State committee that all its leaders must actively join in the campaign for Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> An Obama voter&apos;s cry of despair </seg>
<seg id="1133"> I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change </seg>
<seg id="1134"> He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Obstructionism can&apos;t excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="1136"> Obama&apos;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> I&apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> It&apos;s a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> It&apos;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win,&quot; and it&apos;s a memoir of Barack Obama&apos;s 2008 presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> When I&apos;m finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> During Obama&apos;s transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> And then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> It&apos;s hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> It was simply nothing I could have imagined. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of &quot;don&apos;t ask don&apos;t tell,&quot; to the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I&apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I&apos;ve reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House&apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1159"> And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> I don&apos;t know if this is what I should have expected. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Obviously, elective office isn&apos;t a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration&apos;s own choosing. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> That is what troubles me most of all. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Still, as Obama&apos;s approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> &quot;I want us to get our mojo back,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> We&apos;ve got to remember who we are.&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1174"> It&apos;s five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn&apos;t agree with you more. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says </seg>
<seg id="1177"> Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country&apos;s north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country&apos;s civil war nearly three years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> 1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or &quot;render inoperable&quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus&apos; chemical weapons by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad&apos;s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> It has not updated that figure since. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> Assad&apos;s troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons&apos; inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was &quot;now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria&apos;s declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1197"> It added that, &quot;no further inspection activities are currently planned.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW&apos;s executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> &quot;I salute the fortitude and courage you&apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; the watchdog&apos;s director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad&apos;s government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> In other developments, the Observatory&apos;s chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria&apos;s coastal province of Latakia. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> The cause of the blast was not known, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents </seg>
<seg id="1208"> The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Google is accused of infringing seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google&apos;s search business. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google&apos;s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola&apos;s library of patents. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> &quot;Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe,&quot; the lawsuit said. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google&apos;s patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls) </seg>
<seg id="1221"> Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> But passengers shouldn&apos;t expect changes to happen immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they&apos;ve updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> &quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane&apos;s door closes. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> They&apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> &quot;Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we&apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win,&quot; Glading said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> We&apos;re frankly tired of feeling like &apos;hall monitors&apos; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they&apos;re in the air,&quot; Rosenker said. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> The FAA began restricting passengers&apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Today&apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers&apos; use of the devices has been Amazon.com. </seg>

<seg id="1291"> In a recent media report it was said that the NSA hacked into the data centres of Yahoo and Google for surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> The Washington Post exposed this based on the documents collected by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> According to the report, the NSA program was called Muscular, and was run together with their British counterpart - GCHQ. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Both agencies stole data passing through the vast network of fibre optic cables laid by Yahoo and Google. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> On January 9th, 2013 the Washington Post reported, quoting a top secret document, that more than 18 million documents were stolen within just 3 days from the beginning of the program. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> These included email, text, audio and video messages. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> According to the Washington Post the program was run out of the U.S. and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA to access this information. </seg>

<seg id="1305"> General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> &quot;If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury,&quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> GM&apos;s truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October. </seg>

<seg id="1331"> A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification. </seg>

<seg id="1341"> Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake </seg>
<seg id="1342"> A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month&apos;s Dubai Airshow. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; jet designs. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Boeing says its revamped &quot;777X&quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled &quot;Would You Accept This?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1352"> &quot;Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened &quot;jet set&quot; was narrower. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Boeing disputes Airbus&apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> &quot;It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> They don&apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> Boeing&apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> &quot;The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe&apos;s Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> &quot;Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,&quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The program started with the National Anthem and the lighting of the lamp by all the guests. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Director, Dr.S.K.Garg, said that the institution&apos;s annual function is celebrated as the foundation day. </seg>

<seg id="1391"> Early puberty: Growing older sooner </seg>
<seg id="1392"> African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Physical changes don&apos;t mean puberty is imminent </seg>
<seg id="1394"> There&apos;s no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8? </seg>
<seg id="1399"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> &quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> &quot;Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;precocious&quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child&apos;s age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Psychosocial aspects are important, too. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, &quot;suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls&apos; feelings of being different from peers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don&apos;t want their very young daughters having periods. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> &quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> Yet, there&apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> There are varying explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> &quot;We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> &quot;It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation,&quot; Kaplowitz advised. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Ejaz Jaan, the legislator of the Poonch Assembly Constituency, set up a water cooler in the Gurudwara grounds. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The legislator said that quite a lot of people visit the Gurudwara, but due to the lack of proper water facilities a water cooler has been installed here. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Using this, people can get cold water in the summer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Pure ordinary water will also be available during the winter season. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> This will solve the drinking water problem of the devotees. </seg>

<seg id="1464"> The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> It&apos;s now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid&apos;s secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi&apos;s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy,&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> &quot;No,&quot; Mr Tripodi replied. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> I can&apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn&apos;t that. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Diwali, the festival of wealth, happiness and prosperity begins on Friday with Dhanteras. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Preparations at home and in the markets have reached the final stage. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> To double the enjoyment of the city&apos;s inhabitants the main market Bapu Market, Ashwini Market, Sarafa Market, Badbhuja Valley, Sindhi Market, etc. have put up extensive decorations. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Shopkeepers have made special preparations in their shops for the convenience of their customers. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> The festive atmosphere has resulted in large crowds in the major markets several times during the day. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> There is a competition amongst the merchant unions for the best decorations during Diwali. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> The main markets sectors 4, 5, 6 and sector 14 of the suburban areas have been decorated. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Shopping continued in these markets on the eve of Dhanteras too. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Sales of materials related to worship, lamps and lighting etc. were especially strong on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> On Thursday, the Organisation for the Welfare of the Disabled held a meeting to discuss the welfare of the disabled in the town. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> It was presided over by Vinod Sharma, senior vice-chairman of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> After the meeting the disabled demonstrated against the administration and submitted a memorandum to the SDM Naushera. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Vinod Sharma, while addressing a meeting of the disabled, said that persons with disabilities should receive special concessions for government jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> The disabled should receive promotion in the various government departments based on SCST quotas. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> The monthly pension should be raised from Rs. 400 to Rs. 2,000. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> A prosthesis camp should be organized in Tehsil Naushera and a rehabilitation centre should be opened in Rajouri. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> The disabled also protested with their demands. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> After the meeting, the disabled presented the Naushera SDM, Dipti Uppal, with a memorandum of their demands. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The Naushera SDM assured the disabled that their problems could be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to the police his death was due to drowning. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> However, the police have taken the friend of the deceased into custody for hiding the deceased&apos;s luggage at his house. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The police have filed the final investigation report with the court. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> It may be recalled that on August 26th the police recovered the body of Jahid Iqbal from the Jhelum river in Padshahi Park. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> His family had accused his friends because his mobile and other luggage was missing. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The police said in their report that the deceased&apos;s phone and SIM card were checked and his phone was being used by a woman named Saura. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> After questioning the woman, she said that the phone had been given to her by a relative named Ruhail Gauhar. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Park and was a friend of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> On August 25th, after Namaaz-e-Jumma, Ruhail had gone with Jahid to bathe in the Jhelum river. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> Jahid took off his clothes and left all his things on the banks, while Ruhail went to the other bank to smoke a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> When he returned Jahid was not there, only his clothes were there. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Ruhail looked for Jahid, but he could not find him. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Then he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other things and kept them for his own use. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> He did not tell anyone that Jahid has drowned. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> The police told the court that Jahid has drowned and the post-mortem report confirmed this. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> However, Ruhail was arrested under section 404 for hiding the facts and possessions of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> A drop in temperature of 3.1 degrees was recorded on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> The rain and cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel cold. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> On Thursday people left for the markets and their other destinations wearing sweaters. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> After the first rain of the winter people took out their quilts. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> People were seen enjoying the sunshine in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Once the climate changes there will be relief from colds and other illnesses but after that the clouds kept playing hide and seek with the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> The children also went to school wearing sweaters. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> According to the air force weather department the maximum temperatures on Thursday was 25.1 degree Celsius and the minimum temperatures was 13.7 degree Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> 7.8 millimetres of rainfall was recorded. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> According to the weather department the skies will be cloudy. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> Anger over Bali bomb plotter&apos;s sentence </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia&apos;s most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> He could be released within 15 years if granted parole. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;He should be put in front of the firing squad,&quot; Ms Corteen told AAP. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Peter Hughes was in Paddy&apos;s Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and &quot;died&quot; three times while on life support. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> To keep him alive, well, there&apos;s no reason to keep him alive. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it&apos;s not much. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;He didn&apos;t give himself up,&quot; Ms Corteen said. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Until just recently, he really didn&apos;t feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> &quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; Ms Corteen said. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Patek may yet appeal his sentence. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> When the hotel employees protested the fight began. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> R.K. Singh, the hotel owner&apos;s younger brother came to mediate, the MP&apos;s drunken son started a scuffle with him. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> In the meantime, a lot of people gathered there. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> When an attempt was made to grab the assaulting youth he fired the revolver. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> The shooting triggered panic in the area. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> After this the hotel employees caught him and informed the police. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The hotel owner, Munna Singh, on reaching the police station filed a report against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Barecha Pahadpur at the Koirana station in the Bhadohi district. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Upon which the police arrested Anand and seized his revolver. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> According to Handiya Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Pratapgarh in Khabhor, runs a hotel called Raag Durbar on the National Highway. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> At around 8pm Anand Pandey arrived at the hotel and ordered food. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> When the service was delayed, he started shouting abuse, assaulting the staff and shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Anand was drunk and he also threatened to kill the hotel employees. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> The inspector said that the Hotel is near Bhiti Village and adjacent to Bhadoi District. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough </seg>
<seg id="1563"> The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court </seg>
<seg id="1565"> A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The solicitor, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and hailed by criminals as a &quot;top brief,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer&apos;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Inquiries revealed Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed </seg>
<seg id="1574"> Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> The lawyer&apos;s downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta&apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer&apos;s bins in a black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The court heard Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot;legal privilege.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1582"> During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: &quot;If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> He thwarted the police&apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Lancashire&apos;s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> We will find you and put you before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> After the test plane&apos;s inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to &quot;sector perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation,&quot; Doerksen said in a client note. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company&apos;s claims about the new jetliner&apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;The test plane didn&apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated,&quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane&apos;s downtime. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that&apos;s what we have done. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> That will happen all through the flight program. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> &quot;This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier&apos;s internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15,&quot; said Doerksen. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&apos;s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> The world&apos;s fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment,&quot; Beaudoin said. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> The transportation division&apos;s margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Brazil&apos;s Embraer SA, the world&apos;s third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier&apos;s closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick &apos;Gender Undetermined&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> The new law doesn&apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1648"> I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> Wallis Simpson may have been intersex. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it&apos;s better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child&apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Intersex children pose ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> &quot;Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> It&apos;s like the mystery of why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a &quot;third gender&quot; on their official documents. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world&apos;s first recognized &quot;genderless&quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status for life. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot;gender theory&quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that &quot;as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1670"> One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> &quot;Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don&apos;t know the gender of your child,&quot; she told the parenting website. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a &apos;psychiatric emergency,&apos;&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> When these kids were born, you didn&apos;t call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child&apos;s genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> But in one 1966 case, known as &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories became controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> &quot;Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> But at 38, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Drescher said that now some doctors are still &quot;practicing that model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1686"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot;not happy with the outcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Doctors couldn&apos;t be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce&apos;s external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> He was given female hormones at age 12. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;I knew that I wasn&apos;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> What he found out was horrifying. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Surgery rendered him infertile. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1702"> &quot;A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos;undetermined,&apos;&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> We are afraid it will encourage intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> But we haven&apos;t seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1707"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> German law is about assigning it at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will &quot;empower&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Baratz&apos;s daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> &quot;The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves,&quot; said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos;male&apos; or &apos;female.&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1719"> This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> We don&apos;t have to rush into surgery that is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> &quot;It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don&apos;t feel they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that&apos;s a wonderful thing. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> It empowers children to make the decision for themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> A wonderful performance was given at the show &quot;Ek aur Dronacharya&quot; showing the resemblance between the Dwaapar yug and today. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> It showed how, in today&apos;s world, a teacher can be forced to follow the wrong path in compromising circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The play was inaugurated in the St. Joseph Inter College auditorium jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhdayal Valmiki, Cantonment Board Vice-president Shipra Rastogi, Nresh Kansal and Shakti Singh. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The play showed the similarities between the conditions in Dronacharya in the Dwaapaar age and followed a professor called Arvind in the present day. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The play directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goel, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Ghazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. did full justice to the characters and was a spectacular show. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> The theatre lighting was handled by a young artist, Jitendra C. Raj, and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> After this function on behalf of APTA, many awards were presented to various literary and cultural personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> The head of the Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Senior Journalist Shambhunath Shukla and theatre designer Jitendra C. Raj were awarded on this occasion. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Among the officials of the executive committee, secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc., contributed to the success of the program. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott&apos;s daughters stood to personally benefit from policies. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;He&apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he&apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not,&quot; Mr Palmer said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Tony Abbott&apos;s daughters Frances and Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting? </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;We need to have a better system,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Why is it that we shouldn&apos;t have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night? </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn&apos;t like it? </seg>
<seg id="1748"> In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take &quot;very seriously&quot; his new job. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Public office is about public service. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We seek no reward, except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Another day, another independence scare story. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> Since Scotland isn&apos;t in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> So, a non-story, then. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; canard at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe&apos;s bidding, anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Why trade London&apos;s yoke for that of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1765"> Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September&apos;s federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer&apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we&apos;ve already seen at Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> All the wage freezes in the world won&apos;t stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU&apos;s main cheerleader. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can&apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class? </seg>
<seg id="1786"> She wants to use next year&apos;s EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Here&apos;s my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The EU won&apos;t disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot;Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations&quot; favoured by General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> However, Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Where does this leave Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1794"> We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour&apos;s chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet? </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Flight Centre seem to be bucking the trend. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the $305 million to $315 million it previously forecast. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $290.4 million profit it achieved in 2011/12. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-business travel. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> &quot;Year-to-date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically our largest profit generators. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> In Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre&apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> Its US business had recovered its losses during its seasonally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Flight Centre shares were up 3c at $38.20 yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild </seg>
<seg id="1814"> A bird airlifted ashore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The water rail was put on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being nursed back to health by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Centre manager Colin Seddon said: &quot;This water rail was likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1817"> It seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> He added: &quot;It was unable to fly off again so we were contacted for help.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Nita Ambani, the wife of India&apos;s most important businessman Mukesh Ambani, is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Nita is celebrating her birthday in Jodhpur and not in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> She has organized a big party to mark the occasion. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Many big Bollywood stars have arrived in Jodhpur to the attend the party. In the late evening of October 31st many big stars were seen catching a flight to Jodhpur from Mumbai Airport. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> Among these stars were Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> You can imagine, when such big names were invited, how big the party was. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to advertise the anniversary of the birth of Sardar Patel over the last four years. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> But, contrary to the claims by Modi during the NDA government (between 1994 and 2004), while Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM there was a time for 2 consecutive years (2001-2002) when not a single advertisement for Sardar Patel was published by the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> On Thursday in Kevadia,Gujarat laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel&apos;s 182 meter high statue, &apos;the Statue of Unity&apos;, Modi said, &quot;Earlier, there was no advertising for the anniversary of Sardar Patel. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> While the DAVP&apos;s records show that in 2009-10 up to 3 million, in 2010-11 to Rs 4.10 crore, in 2011-12 and Rs 2.7 crore and in 2012-13 to Rs 1.4 crore UPA had been spent on advertising for Sardar Patel. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> When the Union Information and Broadcasting Minister, Manish Tewari, was asked about Modi&apos;s claims he said that what the BJP&apos;s PM candidate said was not based on the facts. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> In 2008 the UPA did not publish any ads in the name of Patel. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Tiwari said that it was because of the economic downturn in that year. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The amounts spent on promoting Sardar Patel are far less than the amount spent on the birth and death anniversaries of the Nehru - Gandhi family members. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> DAVP has spent 33 crores on the birth and death anniversaries, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and Rs.9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru, on print advertising. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, &quot;it should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Because the price of advertising depends on several things, such as the size or frequency of the advertisement for that year. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> The fact is that it shows our dedication without understanding that the people opposed to this are busy taking care of the legacy of a great leader. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The sacrifice of Shaheed Kesari was remembered and a cultural program, including patriotic presentations, was performed. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The program was organised on Friday at Gandhi park on behalf of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> Here Mayor Vinod Chamoli, with the office bearers of the committee, laid a wreath at the statue of the Shaheed Kesari Chand. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> After that a cultural program was organised at the Hindi Bhavan, where the former SP state President Vinod Badthwal was present. Principal guest and former legislator Munna Singh Chauhan was also present as a special guest. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> In this program Sukh Kala Manch, Jaunsaar presented &apos;Kesari teri yaad mein kashi bhulauni, Jiyendei teri yaddon bira kashi mitauni&apos;, &apos;Veer kesari chand ji ki harut&apos;, Jaunsaar ke aradhya dev mahasu devata ki vandana; etc. Cultural programs were presented. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The principle guest, shedding light on the life of the Veer Shaheed Kesari Chand, made everyone aware of the contribution he had made to the freedom struggle. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The speakers urged those present in the program to become strong-willed and patriotic, like Shaheed Kesari. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The Chairman of the Committee Jayavir Singh Chauhan, Matbar Singh Chauhan, Suresh Tomar, Ravindra Bhandari, Amit Joshi, Mijaan Rai, Sunil Dutt Sharma were present at the event. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> On Friday Congress leader Chadvir Hooda gave a speech to the inhabitants of Sector 2 and Maheshpur village </seg>
<seg id="1847"> During this speech he invited the people to join the rally and determined who was responsible for what. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Chadvir also determined the duties of the activists. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Chadvir Hooda said that the Haryana Chief Minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has spent billions of rupees in the district. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> In the last four years Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has completed development work worth Rs 15 crore in Barwala and has blocked panchayats. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Chadvir Hooda said that because of the appeal of the Chief Minister activists are very excited about this rally and this rally will be the biggest amongst all the rallies so far and this will put Haryana politics on the map in the entire country. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Chadvir said that, based on the popularity gained by the Chief Minister  by the way of landmark decisions and for activities for the people&apos;s welfare, the public would also elect Hooda for the third time. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Supreme Court upholds Obama health care law </seg>
<seg id="1854"> In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama&apos;s signature health care law is constitutional. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law&apos;s requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Australian woman appeals Thai jail time </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> She was held in local police cells before the court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women&apos;s jail. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Tunks told Sydney&apos;s Sunday Telegraph the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about his daughter&apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> &quot;It&apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we&apos;re hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Snowden ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany over US surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: &quot;Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1878"> However, speaking the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela&apos;s Merkel&apos;s phone. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US,&quot; it should be taken. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany&apos;s Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor&apos;s lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, the MP said. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a &quot;severe and sustained&quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Killing mosquitoes to prevent diseases like dengue, malaria and filariasis is going to be expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> The state government is proceeding to raise the tax on mosquito killing repellents, mats and liquids by up to three times. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The proposal to increase tax will be presented to the cabinet soon. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> The government is struggling with a financial crisis these days and is searching for ways to do everything possible to increase revenue. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> It is noteworthy that, to improve the financial health of the government, a resource committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister, Mohamed Azam Khan. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> According to sources, in a recently held resource committee meeting many proposals to increase the tax were rejected if the general public would be directly affected. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> However, the committee has given the green flag to increase the taxes on mosquito repellents, coils, mats and liquids. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> A proposal to triple the taxes has been put forward. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> Currently they carry 4% VAT plus an additional 1% tax. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Now a 12.5% VAT plus a 1.5% additional tax on these items is proposed. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The government is likely to generate additional revenue of around Rs 14 crore in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> A proposal for a tax hike on the persimmon leaf was rejected: In fact, to increase the revenue income the commercial tax department was in favour of increasing the tax on the persimmon leaf by 14%, but the Financial Resources Committee has rejected that proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> The committee believes that persimmon leaf is used to make bidis that the lower-class people smoke. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> Similarly, the committee rejected the proposal to increase taxes on transmission wires, etc., and electrical goods that would have pushed up the cost of electricity and would have a direct impact on the general public. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> The committee also rejected the proposal for the application of a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The bail plea hearing of the former Chief of the Army, General Pervez Musharraf, in the case of the Lal Masjid cleric murder has been postponed until November 4th. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> The next hearing of the case against Musharraf will be held on November 11. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> In 2007, during the military campaign launched against the fanatics hiding in Lal Masjid, cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi was killed. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> The police have already declared Musharraf innocent, which was a great relief for him. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The police said then that President Musharraf did not play a direct role in the assassination of the cleric. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Islamabad Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ), Wajid Ali, is presiding over Musharraf&apos;s bail hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> During the hearing Tarik Asad, the counsel of the Lal Masjid Shuhada Foundation representative and complainant, accused the police of destroying all the evidences of Musharraf&apos;s innocence. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Counsel asked the court for more time to present more evidence in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Subsequently, the court adjourned the bail of Mushraf hearing until November 4th. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Gazprom&apos;s Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era </seg>
<seg id="1917"> The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe&apos;s largest energy projects, Gazprom&apos;s chief said. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia&apos;s export routes through Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia&apos;s gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1923"> Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year&apos;s end. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="1927"> President Barack Obama&apos;s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann&apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1929"> The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President&apos;s top aides conducted &quot;extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011&quot; to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama&apos;s waning re-election hopes. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the Times&apos; national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Only half a dozen of the President&apos;s closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> &quot;Double Down&quot; claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal rapport,&quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn&apos;t &quot;materially improve Obama&apos;s odds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1934"> In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> &quot;I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the paper. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, &quot;Holy Christ, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1937"> While Daley characterized the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;Campaigns don&apos;t spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they&apos;re seriously considering something,&quot; Martin said on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It&apos;s unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> While Daley said he doesn&apos;t think the President &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it&apos;s &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama&apos;s desk. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;Possibly,&quot; Martin replied. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Today he will meet the families of the people who died in Patna last Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As it is Narendra Modi&apos;s second visit to Patna just a week after the blasts the security has been tightened. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> The police have examined the route of Modi&apos;s visit and the sites of the meeting thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Police will keep an eye on the people coming to the meetings. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> The Gujarat police force, the NSGIB and the State police force will take care of security. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Modi&apos;s protective shield will be tightened. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Meanwhile, questions are being raised about the urn procession undertaken by the BJP, carrying the ashes of the people who died in the blasts. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accused the BJP of spoiling the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Congress has given the tickets to all his former legislators. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> In the list there are 6 old and 2 new faces. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The new faces who have been given a chance include Nirmala Sapre from the Bina Assembly constituency&apos;s Sagar District and Pratapsingh Lodhi from Jabera Assembly Constituency&apos;s Damoha District. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Three from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one legislator from Chhatrapur have been given a ticket again. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> As predicted, Govind Singh from Surkhiin Sagar, Arunoday Chaubey from Khurai and Narayan Prajapati from Banda are candidates again. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Tickets have been given to Yadavendra Singh from Tikamgarh and to Brujendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur and Vikramsingh&apos;s grandson Raja from Rajnagar Chhattarpur. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> All these are current legislators in these constituencies. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> It has been decided that, after the first lists from the BJP and Congress, the contest will be between the new faces from both parties in Bina. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Mahesh Rai of the BJP and Nirmala Sapre of the Congress will face each other in Bina. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> At present in the Prithvipur Tikamgarh Congress the MLA, Brijendra Singh Rathore, is running against the late former minister&apos;s wife, Anita Nayak </seg>
<seg id="1963"> The current MLA Vikramsingh&apos;s grandson, Raja of Raj Nagar, will be challenged by Ramkrushna Kusumariya of the BJP. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Arunoday Chaubey the MLA of Khurai and the MLA Bhupendra Singh of the BJP will go face to face. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Govind Rajput, the MLA from Surakhi, is being challenged by the BJP&apos;s youth leader, Paril Sahoo. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Guillaume Nicloux&apos;s adaptation of Denis Diderot&apos;s novel boasts exceptional production design and period detail but is also heavier going than it should be. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Unfolding in 1760s France, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a wantonly sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The film never slips into prurience or sensationalism - and that&apos;s the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> The earnest solemnity of the storytelling risks making it a hair shirt-like ordeal for audiences, too. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found </seg>
<seg id="1972"> One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel&apos;s discovery, according to court records. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico&apos;s marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Greetings were exchanged between the two in a cabinet meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> After the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in the meditation camp for the counter attack on Narendra Modi. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> He also commented on his speech, saying that he didn&apos;t have any second thoughts in his mind. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> He wanted the party to become strong. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> New challenges will be faced strongly. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> The expression on the Chief Minister&apos;s face showed that he had taken Singh&apos;s speech in a positive way. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> It should be noted that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the activists in the meditation camp and to protect them from the alleged harassment by officials. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> However, he had also said that to assert his point he was also prepared for the dissolution of the cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> Though, after seeing the opinions arising from the meditation camp there was a chance that the case for putting activists into government posts will also be reconsidered. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> At the camp the state JDU president, Vashisht Narayan Singh, had said that the nominations of the activists in the 20-point committee would be announced soon. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> He also indicated that the list was almost ready. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Now the news is coming that Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, will have a look at the list at his level. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> He will also examine whether or not the opinion of the legislators and Members of Parliament was taken into account when generating the list. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> If need be the list will be revised on a large scale to give places to older and more committed activists. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> The common complaint of the legislators and Members of Parliament is that their opinion was not considered while generating the list. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Most of the people who have come from other parties are on the list but a significant number of workers, active since the Samata Party period, have been left off. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> Halloween 2013: By the Numbers </seg>
<seg id="2001"> When I was little, Halloween was magical. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Nowadays, I&apos;ve become more of a scrooge. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> I haven&apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won&apos;t this year. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> But stats show that I&apos;m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Women don&apos;t have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I&apos;ll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> I guess there&apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> That&apos;s a lot of ironic hotdog dogs. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> When it comes to candy, we don&apos;t screw around. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> That&apos;s around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> That&apos;s great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The one thing we don&apos;t want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> That&apos;s about 9 billion individual kernels of corn. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> It&apos;s a mystery I have yet to solve. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> They have the best names, like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which, by the way is in an actual prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2027"> In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can&apos;t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot;nice face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Finally, let&apos;s talk pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it&apos;s something we&apos;ve done since we were little. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Lucky for us, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin trend&quot; started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> If you&apos;re looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, while others create a perfect life by their hard work and people take inspiration from them. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> One of the such personalities is the late Dhirubhai Ambani. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> The third son of Hirachand Govaradhandas Ambani, who worked as a teacher in a school in Coravada, a small village in Gujarat, Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28th, 1932. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> Dhirubhai was the third of five brothers and sisters. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> The five children were Ramanikalala, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters, Trilochana and Jasumati. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> Due to financial constraints Dhirubhai had to drop out after high school. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Dhirubhai started helping in the house financially from childhood. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> At that time he set up a stall selling Bhajiyas near Girnar. The income from the stall was dependent on the number of tourists going there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> Dhirubhai&apos;s first job was in 1949 at the age of 17 when he arrived on a ship called Cabota in the city of Aden, in the Yemen. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> His elder brother, Raniklala, had made all the arrangements for him there, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> But Dhirubhai had something else in mind. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> So he returned home in 1954. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> By 1955, he had landed in Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket, to try his luck. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> And from here he started his travel business. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Dhirubhai never looked back. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> His name became known not only in the country, but also abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Dhirubhai Ambani bade farewell to the world on July 6th, 2002. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> When he died he had Rs 62,000 crores. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Currently his sons, Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, are looking after his empire. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Like their father, today these two brothers are at the international level of businessmen. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Who has not heard of the Ambani family today? </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, their two sons, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Is Europe&apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK&apos;s wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain&apos;s business sizes, sectors and regions. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate. </seg>

<seg id="2063"> When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe&apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that brings powers back to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain&apos;s membership of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels&quot; regulatory approach. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> The cause of the death of the tigress was not clear, even after the post-mortem. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> The forest department, giving an evasive answer, said that prima-facie, the tigress seemed to have died a natural death. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> On Thursday night the forest employees of the Pawalgarh Conservation reserve of the Ramnagar Forest department found a tigress&apos;s body near the Khichadi drain. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The tigress&apos;s body was intact and no signs of wounds or injury were found on the body. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> On Friday an autopsy was conducted on the body of the tigress by CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore in the presence of the Conservator of Forests, Vivek Pandey, the CTR deputy director, Saket Badola, DFO Kahakasha Naseem, and SDO J.S. Karkee. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> According to sources, during the autopsy, the internal organs of the tigress were reported to be damaged. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Because of this the actual cause of death of the tigress was not known. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Department officials are giving evasive answers about the death of the tigress. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> However, to test for the presence of poison, the internal organs have been sent to IVRI Barelli for a toxicology test. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Vivek Pandey, the Conservator of Forest Western Circle, said that the tigress&apos;s death could be considered as natural. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> There were no traces of poison in the body. </seg>

<seg id="2101"> Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law </seg>
<seg id="2102"> &quot;It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?&quot; the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> &quot;This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya&apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it&apos;s an extension of the government,&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya&apos;s place in the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> &quot;I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot;a stranglehold over the media,&quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot;dealt a major blow&quot; and lambasted the bill as &quot;draconian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2107"> The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September&apos;s attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot;de-listed,&quot; or barred from receiving official press accreditation. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2113"> It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya&apos;s &quot;lively blogosphere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2114"> By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> &quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> &quot;Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering,&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past. </seg>

<seg id="2120"> Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that &quot;if you like your health plan, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2121"> With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> &quot;For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Addressing what he called the &quot;flurry in the news&quot; about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> &quot;You&apos;re going to get a better deal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn&apos;t meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> &quot;Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot;miserably&quot; since October. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> I am eager to earn your confidence back. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday&apos;s House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family&apos;s attorney said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Lowndes County sheriff&apos;s investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old&apos;s family disputes that. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> &quot;They absolutely think their son was murdered,&quot; Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> &quot;They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,&quot; Crump said. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son&apos;s death. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> &quot;They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson&apos;s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> What was the cause of death? </seg>
<seg id="2152"> Was his death the result of a crime? </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I will follow the facts wherever they lead. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> My objective is to discovery the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> &quot;I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists&quot; for a formal investigation, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2158"> A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> &quot;There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff&apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> The teenager&apos;s parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> While addressing a rally Modi said, &quot;If you listen to all the speeches given by all the leaders of Congress, then you will see that they never talk about what they have done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2165"> He said, &quot;Congress has become so arrogant that does not answer media questions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and it is his government, yet they want Modi to respond. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> Answering the public&apos;s questions is your duty. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> Clearly, Modi was referring to Sibal, who had told journalists in Delhi that Modi wants to create an environment where he is in control, where he gives his speeches and he does not talk to journalists in order to avoid their questions. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Sibal challenged Modi to a face to face debate. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Tony Blair said he&apos;d seize the chance to return as Britain&apos;s prime minister - but acknowledges a comeback is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> In an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old aired his views on various domestic policies. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, confining most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair was quoted by London&apos;s Evening Standard as saying: &quot;Yes, sure, but it&apos;s not likely to happen is it, so...&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2200"> Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream? </seg>
<seg id="2201"> A British entrepreneur has created the world&apos;s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> The ice cream reacts with the eater&apos;s tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Charlie, founder of the &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious&quot; ice cream company, said: &quot;It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2207"> The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> So each scoop costs me around £140. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> It tastes pretty good though. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Charlie&apos;s experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> He said: &quot;I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Between the hide and seek with the sun, rain continued in low-lying areas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> This created a cold front in the valley. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> The cold could be gauged by the fact that the minimum temperature at Shrinagar was 4.8 degrees Celsius, in Gulmarg it was below 0 at -0.2 degrees and in Leh it reached -1.8 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Leh was the coolest place in the whole state. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> However, due to rain and snow the strategically important Srinagar to Leh national highway has been closed to traffic. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> There is heavy snowfall in the Jozilla Pass. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> This is the fourth snowfall of the season in the Kashmir valley and the first heavy snowfall. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Due to the western disturbance activity, since the early hours of Thursday the higher hilly regions have experienced some snowfall and the low lying areas had rainfall, that continued until late into the evening. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Normal life has also been affected by the cold. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> People remained in their homes to avoid the cold. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Meanwhile, the electricity supply has also failed in this area. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> The day temperatures in Shrinagar were four degrees below normal and were recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Due to the rains along with strong winds in Jammu in the early morning of Thursday, the cold increased at night. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> A minimum temperature of 16.6 and a maximum temperature of 27.0 degrees Celsius were recorded in Jammu. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> According to the weather department, the influence of the western disturbances is declining and the weather will improve by Friday. </seg>

<seg id="2245"> Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy </seg>
<seg id="2246"> A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge&apos;s order requiring changes to the New York Police Department&apos;s stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> An oral argument on the city&apos;s appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> Supporters of changes to the NYPD&apos;s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The judge noted she wasn&apos;t putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> If, after the general election, the new government continued the policy of not selling kerosene through ration shops then in half a dozen states kerosene would not be sold in these shops. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> The Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are among the states where the sale of kerosene sale will be stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> In addition to these, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and some states in the north-east are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry the decision to stop the sale of kerosene through PDS shops is based on two criteria. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The first criterion is that an electricity supply are being installed in the rural areas at a rapid pace. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> The second criterion is the LPG supply network. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> This means that in those states where most households in the rural areas have gas connections the sale of PDS kerosene will be stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Petroleum Ministry is fully prepared for this. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Since October 2013 the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> According to sources, under this policy the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The Punjab quota of 2.72 lakh kilolitres was reduced to one lakh kilolitres. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> The kerosene quota allocation for Haryana was reduced by 70% and for Uttarakhand it was reduced by almost 40%. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Despite this reduction no shortage of kerosene has been reported by these states. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The Ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene is used for adulteration. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The difference in the price of diesel and PDS kerosene is currently Rs.37. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> This encourages those who carrying out adulteration. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> In the states where the sale of kerosene through PDS shops has been stopped, the oil companies can sell kerosene at full price on the open market. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> At present the oil companies are selling kerosene at a loss of Rs.39 per litre. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> The burden of the kerosene subsidy in the year 2013-14 is estimated to be 31,000 crore rupees. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On behalf of the Ramnagar Tehsil Legal Services Committee and under the chairmanship of the committee chairman, Ramnagar Sub-Judge Sandip Kaur, a Legal Awareness Camp was organised at the Middle school, Dalher in Ramnagar. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> In this camp awareness was raised about the right to education and information for financially underprivileged people. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Advocate M.L. Gupta, Rohin Bharadwaj and Sarpanch presented their views on the subject and gave lectures to the people in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> A large number of villagers attended the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker </seg>
<seg id="2286"> One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Fay&apos;s innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> &quot;Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they&apos;re too big to play a club,&quot; Hirsch said. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> This year&apos;s event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Several of the comedians participating in this year&apos;s festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX&apos;s gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed &quot;The League&quot;) and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; though she is best known for her viral video series &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2296"> Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> One of the festival&apos;s biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2300"> The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry&apos;s work,&quot; Steinberg said. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> He was telling me that, when he&apos;s here, sometimes he&apos;ll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I&apos;ll live here. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="2306"> There aren&apos;t many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Cast your vote here or through your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren&apos;t equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon&apos;s capital. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> &quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; Georges Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;It&apos;s not easy,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> There are a lot of patients. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> Some people can die because they are waiting. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The situation hasn&apos;t changed much since Bwelle&apos;s father passed away in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> For comparison&apos;s sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn&apos;t afford it. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country&apos;s health-care spending is private. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde&apos;s Central Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Their luck doesn&apos;t always hold out. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> They&apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes&apos; welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> &quot;We are receiving 500 people in each trip,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they&apos;re coming on foot. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that&apos;s required for school but that many impoverished families simply can&apos;t afford. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> With the group&apos;s generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> It&apos;s a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> &quot;They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> One man explained that the free hernia surgery he&apos;d received will allow him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;This will change my future with my family,&quot; the man said. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> It&apos;s this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> &quot;I&apos;m not sure when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O&apos;Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle&apos;s group. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> For medical and nursing students such as O&apos;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it&apos;s a hands-on opportunity they&apos;d never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;We&apos;ve been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> That&apos;s not something you&apos;d ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> &quot;He&apos;s a hero, without a doubt,&quot; O&apos;Malley said. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn&apos;t a hardship. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> &quot;I am so happy when I am doing this work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> I hope he sees what I am doing. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that&apos;s why I&apos;m doing this. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Check out the ASCOVIME website and see how to help. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> A proposal concerning this matter has been sent to the government on behalf of ADA, which is soon going to be approved. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> This historical city, surrounded on three sides by Ganga-Jamuna has no land left where ADA can plan a big residential project. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> So now they have decided to plan residential projects beyond Jhunsi in the east, Fafamau in the north, and beyond Naini in the South. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> To make the plan inclusive a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the District collector, Rajshekhar. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> ADA has plans to include the villages of Phulpur, Soranva, and Kurchhuna, with a population of two hundred citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> After being included in the ADA boundary the Chaka and Bahadur blocks will be completed. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Half of the Kaudihar block will be brought within the ADA boundary. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> According to Amarnath Upadhyaya, secretary of ADA, a proposal concerning this matter has been sent to the government. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> ADA wants to bring the boundaries of these grampanchayants under its authorisation for planning, and will begin work on it soon. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> If that happens, the price of buildings will decline in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The availability of housing for the general public will be increased. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Soon residential palaces on the lines of Lucknow and Noida will begin to be built in these new areas. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat filed his nomination for the Assembly constituency. </seg>

<seg id="2389"> Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash </seg>
<seg id="2390"> With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique&apos;s founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> &quot;We want peace back; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;we demand security&quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital&apos;s Independence Square on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa&apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country&apos;s independent government. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group&apos;s leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo&apos;s spokesman, told the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> &quot;Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> &quot;It&apos;s two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Renamo&apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country&apos;s democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> &quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> &quot;People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> &quot;No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Para-military forces have been deployed, from the forest to the town, for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> The forces are protecting polling stations in Bastar, Rajnandgaon and Dhamtari. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> According to police officers, the Naxal operation is continuing at the border. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> 80 platoons have been deployed in the district as this a Naxal affected area. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> All forces have come from their respective regions. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> During the elections, intelligence reported the possibility of a Naxal attack. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> An alert has been issued. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> The forces have increased their searches and Naxal operations. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The CSP, Mohan Dubey, said security arrangements have been tightened for the festival, before the elections are held. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Armed paramilitary soldiers have been deployed at the Manav Mandir Chowk, Bharat Mata Chowk, Basantapur, Jaystamb Square, Imam Square and Ganj Chowk in the city. </seg>

<seg id="2438"> Efforts are being made to avoid any untoward incident during the elections and Diwali. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It has been revealed that a ransom of two lakh rupees was demanded from the trader. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> If no money was paid he was threatened and told his daughter would be kidnapped. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> In a case registered in the Hudkeshwar police station efforts to solve the crime are being taken by the cyber cell. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Narendra Bahad (21),a resident of Ayodhya City, is the owner of an electronics shop. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Between the 25th and the 29th he received calls from various numbers on his mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> The callers asked for two lakh rupees as ransom. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> He was threatened that if the money was not paid Narendra would be killed or his daughter would be kidnapped. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Narendra did not take the threats seriously at first, but when the threats started to increase and his 12th. Std. daughter was threatened he became worried. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> The family members are frightened. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> A complaint was lodged on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> No clue to the identity of the criminals has yet been found. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> Given the severity of the case support from the cyber crime cell is being sought. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> The MCA said in a statement, &quot;It was decided that the postage stamp with Sachin&apos;s photograph on it would be issued prior to the start of the match. </seg>

<seg id="2473"> At Colchester Magistrates&apos; Court Howie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="2477"> Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they&apos;re the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> There are now 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2481"> In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February&apos;s consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Next year&apos;s consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> In the past the Pope decided everything on his own. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> &quot;Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> But we&apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it&apos;s all completely new. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was &quot;full of surprises -- so we don&apos;t know who he&apos;ll name.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2495"> Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo &quot;genuineness&quot; test </seg>
<seg id="2496"> A &quot;genuineness&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government&apos;s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&apos;s neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> &quot;Loud declarations about &apos;foreigners getting to the back of the queue&apos; and &apos;Aussie jobs first&apos; are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Immigration Minister Brendan O&apos;Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> If the &quot;genuineness&quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about &quot;whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2504"> Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> The man&apos;s distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died. </seg>
