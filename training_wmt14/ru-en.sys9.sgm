<seg id="60"> Power engineering of Dnepropetrovshchiny they began unique program on rescuing… of the nests of the storks </seg>
<seg id="61"> In the old times in order to privadit to the court of storks, peasants in the high post installed wheel from the cart, and heavy nest on it was held well. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Such special supports have not for a long time they placed; therefore storks chose the posts of electric power lines - the interlaced branches rest on the wires, aistinyy house stands reliably thanks to which. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The grandmother of Anya, near house of which in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovskogo region already of years twenty lives aistinaya family, began to note, as nest it settles, in spite of all efforts of its inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Birds place from above new twigs, and lower layer already sagged between the wires, any minute now it will collapse. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Certainly, it is pitiful the family of the storks, that each year nested in podvorya, they derived and brought up in the summer of three-four fledglings, even without to remain it is not desirable light. </seg>
<seg id="66"> As soon as bird they flew away into the warm of edge, the grandmother of Anya rang into Tsarichanskiy RES, to which the support belongs. </seg>
<seg id="67"> And even it did not expect that there they will react so rapidly. </seg>
<seg id="68"> When our specialists arrived into Ivanovku, they were astonished, that the nest generally still is held, described the technical director of DTEK “Dneprooblenergo” Sergey Berezovsky. </seg>
<seg id="69"> On the wires, which proved to be, in the essence, already inside the nest, the weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion. </seg>
<seg id="70"> At any moment of bird they could die from the electrical discharge. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Yes even local residents risked to remain without the light because of the wire fault. </seg>
<seg id="72"> Therefore linear fitters began recovery operation of nest, moreover no longer for the first time in our practice. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The learned ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk national university, who developed the carry circuit of nest, helped. </seg>
<seg id="74"> They conducted trainings for the colleagues of transmission networks. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted power engineers in all stages of reconstruction of nests. </seg>
<seg id="76"> They calculated for the beginning, that in the region in emergency state are more than 50 aistinykh “apartments”. </seg>
<seg id="77"> For their reconstruction the special metallic platforms, which resemble funnel, were welded. </seg>
<seg id="78"> They braided basis by willow branches, and then they transferred there old nest. </seg>
<seg id="79"> In the opinion of the experts, it suffices to pack old branches as the basis so that the birds would learn nest and would return to it. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Already then storks themselves will finish building their dwelling. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Month ago in the village the sand eel of Novomoskovsk region was reconstructed the first nest. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Next to the electro-support they placed new ferroconcrete post and placed platform with old, already settled nest on it. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Entire operation managed to power engineers into nine thousand 10 kopecks. </seg>
<seg id="84"> But recently the same new home took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovskogo region on podvore of the grandmother of Ani. </seg>
<seg id="85"> They here fastened platform at the previous place, only raised above the wires. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Ornithologists are assured that the careful, conservative birds even will not note in spring that their “apartment” underwent innovation repair. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Before the end of the year the same reconstruction expects four additional nests in Pokrovskiy and Tsarichanskom the Dnepropetrovshchiny regions. </seg>
<seg id="88"> By the way, until some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Sad news recently flew around entire region - in the village Ust&apos;-Kamenka the Apostolovskogo region, during the opening day of hunting the pheasants, the poachers for the entertainment shot swan family, which dwelled on the local to pond. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Noble birds in no way feared people - their local residents fed and did not offend. </seg>
<seg id="91"> When villagers, after hearing shots, came running to the pond, four handsome man-swans already lay on the water dead. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Now the colleagues of Apostolovskogo rayotdela of the police explain, who shot at the birds, carried into the Red Book. </seg>

<seg id="147"> In the speech for the prosecution Anne White she said: “If someone knows that one ought not to break rule, then this is attorney in the criminal cases”. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Mr. Ditta is charged with the abuse of her position of attorney in the criminal cases, since he entered the too close relations with the specific clients. </seg>
<seg id="149"> The contact, about which we speak, this not is not simple drug dealer, but drug dealer, who supplies with the narcotics of his own attorney. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Some of its conversations will undoubtedly prove to be legitimate, since it was their attorney. </seg>
<seg id="151"> However, this to a considerable degree crossed the boundaries of the usual attitudes of attorney and client. </seg>
<seg id="152"> It prevented the police investigation so strongly, as this is possible in order to allow these persons to continue its criminal activity. </seg>

<seg id="166"> The producers of jet aircraft quarrel apropos of the width of the seat, when for konu the large orders </seg>
<seg id="167"> The bitter heated argument apropos of the width of the seats of tourist class on the distant voyages developed itself between the chief producers of aircraft, assigning tone for the bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show in this month. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Dispute is twirled around the width of the seats, given on the dalnemagistralnykh voyages to the passengers of economy-class, whose interests are not always the center stage of airlines, with the fact that the volume chosen space of chosen for them plays key role in the assertions about the effectiveness of the last aircraft, proposed to Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Airbus on this week called to the introduction of the branch standard, which would provide for the width of seat not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of economy-class, but its basic American competitor of Boeing says that this they must solve airlines. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Dispute goes when the producers of aircraft compete in sales ever larger versions of their twin-engined dalnemagistralnykh aircraft, and on measure 17 on November 21 are expected potentially record orders. </seg>
<seg id="171"> The layout of the tail end of the aircraft — especially that, do sit 9 or 10 people in a number — occupies central place in the statements about the economic effectiveness of the new designs “of mini--air buses”. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Boeing asserts that it updated by 777X will contain 406 people, on the basis of the seats in the economic class more than 17 inches into the width, placed on 10 in each number. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy-class 350 people on the seats by the width of 18 inches, located on 9 in a number. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The giants of aircraft construction are frequently exchanged impacts on technical questions with the aid of the advertisement in the professional press. </seg>
<seg id="175"> But now Airbus turns directly to the community before air show in Dubai, where 777X, as it is expected, he will become leader with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="176"> It recently demonstrated, what the beginning of new advertising war can be, after showing financiers the slide, which depicts three people in the restaurant, forced against each other, by the name “you would agree to this?” </seg>
<seg id="177"> “Boeing proposes dalnemagistralnye flights on the seats of narrower than in regional turboprop aircraft”, said the leader of sales Airbus John Likhya. </seg>
<seg id="178"> With a change in the food ration the people collect weight, but aircraft seats radically did not change. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Between the beginning of the 1970&apos;s, when wide-body Boeing 747 assigned the standards of contemporary distant journeys, and boundary of century the weight of average American man at the age from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the department of public health of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The grasp of the waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data of health services of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Airbus asserts that its competitor adheres to the concept of the seats 1950-X of the years, when the average grasp of the waist of those, whom they recently named “reactive public”, was already. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Airbus indicates that ordered the study, which testifies that additional in the width of seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus according to the sizes of seats and indicates that for producers it is not worthwhile to interfere in the solutions about how to airlines to find the balance between the tariffs and conveniences. </seg>
<seg id="184"> According to her, studies show that convenience in the salon depends not only on the width of seat. </seg>
<seg id="185"> “Everything in reality is reduced to the assignment to the airlines of selection and opportunity to make that the fact that in their opinion they must make for achievement success”, said the specialist of Boeing in the salons Kent Kreyver. </seg>
<seg id="186"> They do not want so that we would decide for them, which will bring profit to them. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They know their matter better than someone still. </seg>
<seg id="188"> For the passengers a question consists of an increase in the space along the sides, but for the suppliers this increasingly more frequently it becomes the factor, which can influence profit. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The race after the orders for the aircraft, evaluated at least in $700 billion on the catalog prices in the next decades stands after this dispute — it is sufficient in order to change the relationship of American and European export. </seg>
<seg id="190"> As for the first time reported in July the Reuters News Agency, seat direction — this precisely that which preheats rivalry in the battle between the newest jet aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Both Airbus and Boeing declare about a 20th-percent increase in the profitableness by one place in their last twin-engined dalnemagistralnykh models in comparison with the leader of market in this segment, to 365-local Boeing 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The declared characteristics of Boeing are partially based on the comparison of 10th-local numbers 777X with the original 9-seat layout of numbers of constructive solution of 777. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Gain in the specific prime cost is reduced with the comparison with the 10th-local layout, utilized at present. </seg>
<seg id="194"> “The reason, for which Boeing makes this, it lies in the fact that to squeeze more than places and to make a friendly aircraft more competitive in comparison with our developments”, said Kevin Keniston, head of the division of the comfort of the passengers of Airbus in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="195"> From the other side, the analysts say that the salons with complete 10th-local numbers for existing 777-X indicate that many passengers prefer the dense planting, which can go hand to hand with the lower tariffs. </seg>
<seg id="196"> “Seats with the width of eighteen inches would be ideal for the passengers, but reality was such, that from a commercial point of view the proposal of Airbus is caused by threat from the side 777-y of model”, she said the specialist in the interior of the salon of Mary Kirbi, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Airbus and Boeing do not supply armchair, but they propose the catalog of suppliers, from which the airlines can select. </seg>

<seg id="327"> Accuser, royal attorney Andrew Edis reported to the judgment of Old-Bayley that in May 2005 the newspaper of News of the World obtained the uncertain news about the fact that Clark meets with his “attractive special sovetnitsey” of Khannoy Polbi. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Newspaper directed private detective Glenn Mulkeyru to force open voice mail of Polbi and it was on the watch it in house in order to take interview, but also Koulson also rang by it and left voice messages, heard court. </seg>

<seg id="330"> He said that the newspaper of News of the World used three methods of the investigation of the histories: the breaking of telephones, shadowing and opposition. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Editor is personally mixed in the third. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Obviously, he knows about the second, about the shadowing, it is simply must. </seg>

<seg id="334"> Does know he about the breaking of telephones? </seg>
<seg id="335"> He indicates that no, we speak: “O, yes!” </seg>
<seg id="336"> Rumors about Clark&apos;s novel for the first time drew attention to the editorial staff of News of the World, when to the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polbi, they said: “Do not spend time, it with Charles”. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Cassette with the voice messages, obtained from its telephone at least three times, was withdrawn from the house of Mulkeyra in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Inspectors also found the records on the computer of private detective, in which Miss Polbi and its sister figured as “projects”. </seg>
<seg id="339"> For the duration of the period, when it was found under the shadowing, grandmother and grandfather of Mrs. Polbi obtained anonymous calls with the requests to grant information about it, said Mr. Edis. </seg>
<seg id="340"> At this time former chief reporter Neville Terlbek and former reporter James Uezerap controlled shadowing after the movements of Mrs. Polbi. </seg>
<seg id="341"> After leaving by it voice message on June 18, 2005, Koulson it said: “I have the history, which we plan to publish tomorrow and which I greatly wanted to discuss with Charles”. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Mr. Edis said that the participation of Koulsona in this history occurred on the same scenario as with other influential people, for example with the former minister of internal affairs David Blankett. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Jurors heard on Thursday, that Koulson entered the confrontation with Mr. Blankettom apropos of the novel with the married woman while it itself was encountered with the sootvetchitsey Rebecca Brooks, who was at that moment married. </seg>

<seg id="346"> In the bases of MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) there is no group “fraternal circle”, to which in the USA they added Lepsa </seg>
<seg id="347"> In the databases of the Russian power figures of the group “fraternal circle”, to which Washington added singer Grigori Lepsa, it is not registered. </seg>
<seg id="348"> As they noted “to Interfax” in the law-enforcement agencies RF, after in media outlets appeared communications about the introduction by the Board of Exchequer of the USA Grigori Leps in check list on the suspicion of membership in Eurasian criminal syndicate “fraternal circle”, all databases were checked, but such group it was not discovered. </seg>
<seg id="349"> The propagation of this information contributes to the maintenance of myth about the so-called “Russian Mafia”, who allegedly acts abroad, they count in the primary structures. </seg>
<seg id="350"> “Even in the name itself - &apos;fraternal circle&apos;, is a certain element of mysteriousness, is contained hint to the secret gunstock. </seg>
<seg id="351"> “All this is very similar to the PR-action”, said the collocutor of agency. </seg>
<seg id="352"> The Board of Exchequer of the USA on October 31 declared about the recording onto its check list on the suspicion of membership in the Eurasian criminal syndicate “fraternal circle” of Arthur Badalyan, Grigori Lepsveridzes, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov of Rybalskogo and Igor Shlykova. </seg>
<seg id="353"> The persons, carried in this list, they suspect of the connections with the certain by Vladislav Leont&apos;yev and Gafurom by Rahimov, which are considered as the influential members of criminal groups and they are located in the sanction lists of the USA since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="354"> In the opinion of the U.S. authorities, Grigori Leps &quot; serves as messenger for the delivery of Vladislav Leont&apos;yev&apos;s money on behalf”. </seg>
<seg id="355"> In the producer center of Grigori Leps they refused to comment on the charges of the USA in the address of singer, after naming their “delirium”. </seg>
<seg id="356"> In 2011 the President of the USA Barack Obama carried syndicate “fraternal circle” to the number “essential transnational organized criminal groups” and directed Minfin (Ministry of Finance) “to undermine and to prohibit their global criminal operations”. </seg>

<seg id="358"> Scientists shed light to that, as the motions of tail dogs were connected with her mood. </seg>
<seg id="359"> Earlier studies showed that the contented dogs wag by tail to the right side (from the point of view of dog), while the worried dogs wave by tail predominantly to the left side. </seg>
<seg id="360"> But now scientists say that other representatives of the family of hound can note these thin differences in the wobble by tail and react on them. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Professor Dzhordzhio Vallortigara, neyrobiolog from the Trentskogo university, he says: “It is well known that in people the left and right sides of the brain differently participate in shaping of the stimulators, that cause positive or negative emotions”. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Here we attempted to look to this and in other forms. </seg>
<seg id="363"> It added that just as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of body and on the contrary, two hemispheres play different roles in the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="364"> In order to learn more about how dogs they react to many-sided povilivaniya of the tails of other dogs, researchers controlled animals, when they looked films about other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="365"> They measured the frequency of palpitation of animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Probably, already soon we will understand, why their tails sometimes are sent for one side, and sometimes — into another </seg>
<seg id="367"> Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs of video with the dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouette in order to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate by the motion of tail and direct tail more to the left or to the right”. </seg>
<seg id="368"> When animals saw that in other respects nothing the expressing dog moved tail to the right (from the point of view wagging dog of the wagging by tail), they remained completely slack. </seg>
<seg id="369"> But when they noted that the tail was inclined predominantly to the left (again from the point of view wagging dog) of the wagging tail, their palpitation was repeated and they appeared worried. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that the dogs intentionally associated with each other with the aid of these motions. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In reality it considers that the dogs learned from their experience, about what motions by it one should worry, and about what are not. </seg>
<seg id="372"> It notes: “If occur several meetings with other dogs and frequently the wobble of their tail to one side is connected with the friendlier behavior, and right side gives less friendly behavior, then dog reacts on the basis of this experience”. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Researchers say that these results can give more a fundamental understanding of the emotions of their animal to owners, veterinarians and trainers. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Expert in the region of the behavior of dogs to John Bredsho, the invited scientific worker in the veterinary school of Bristol university, said that this was the not first study for checking that, do have a value for the dogs left and right sides. </seg>
<seg id="375"> In the past year the group of scientists from Lincoln&apos;s university revealed that the dogs turn heads to the left, if they look at the aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at the contented dog. </seg>
<seg id="376"> But in another scientific work of the university of Victorias in Canada it reported: “Dogs more frequently approached the dog-robot, when the wobble of its tail was sent to the left, but not to the right, instead of become worried, opposite behavior with respect to an Italian study”. </seg>
<seg id="377"> He said that the differences could be because the dogs in different studies did not completely receive animals in the films or dog-robots as the dogs. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Could be useful a study of that how dogs they react to the present dogs, it explained. </seg>
<seg id="379"> “While on different mammals there exists sufficiently evidence of the fact that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, for many component still one must refine, and dog not exception”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="380"> However, taking into account that ease, with which can be registered their behavior, probably, already soon we will understand, why their tails sometimes are sent for one side, and sometimes — into another. </seg>
<seg id="381"> It is ready ehlite of Europe news business with England? </seg>
<seg id="382"> The campaign of Business for Britain was neglected with the obligation to in April gather the representatives of business and to determine, what changes the creators of welfare and jobs for Great Britain want to see in the relations with the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="383"> For this purpose we ordered the largest and most complete interrogation of British business-leaders, after requesting them to express its thoughts about Great Britain, business and the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The company of YouGov interrogated more than 1000 business-leaders, who present the wide shear of business in Great Britain according to the sizes, to sectors and to regions. </seg>
<seg id="385"> The conclusions of interrogation will prove to be unexpected contingency for many. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We explained that the overwhelming majority of enterprises at present searches for the opportunities of export beyond the limits of Europe, paying special attention to the countries, which conduct modernization even they grow, while the countries the European Union are found in the stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="387"> They want so that the government would return priority to new commercial relations with such countries as China, India and Brazil, but it did not spend time on the long and difficult process of reforming the intricate institutes the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When they asked them about their views on specific political questions, from the antitrust regulation to the laws about production, the majority of business-leaders considered that the monitoring of these key spheres of scope must be returned to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="389"> The general dissatisfaction with the single market was present, the representatives of business declaring, that the expenses from the regulation from Brussels now hang somewhere else advantages from the presence in the commercial zone of Europe, agreed with this even 40 percent of important enterprises, traditionally most proevropeyski of those disposed of all companies. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The last and most exponential — our interrogation of the leaders of business revealed, which explicit majority wants so that Great Britain would carry out course on a treaty modification and to the relations with the European Union, based on the trade, but not on the policy. </seg>
<seg id="391"> This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business-groups, shows that the business insists on “significant change”, which will return authorities back to Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="392"> Rates are high — reaching changes in the agreement and of the more advantageous conditions for Great Britain will ensure 16-percent shift in the affirmative vote that in order to remain in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The Prime Minister have to be of any doubts: this interrogation shows that the British business supports its plan of the revision of the conditions of membership of Great Britain in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="394"> It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to the significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the side of Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The best conditions for the British business are possible and become all more necessary in proportion to that how the Euro-zone it enters to the way of closer economic and financial association. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Priority must return to jobs and economic growth in Great Britain, and, as show the results of our interrogation, for the business this indicates the intensive concentration of attention in the trade and fundamental changes in the normative activity of Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="414"> In Siberia it does not stand to be veganom: hot-house tomato will not replace supchik </seg>
<seg id="415"> Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life to Siberia, it explained the correspondent of Russian International News Agency. </seg>
<seg id="416"> People, which completely forewent themselves the products of animal origin, must not live in Siberia. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Here by them not to transfer winter without the losses for the health, and their no hot-house tomatoes compensate, count vegana interrogated on the eve of the day Novosibirsk dietologists and doctors. </seg>
<seg id="418"> To drink oil by the liters </seg>
<seg id="419"> A strict vegetarianism, when they reject not only the meat and fish, but also the milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life. </seg>
<seg id="420"> However, doctor-dietologists are assured that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict standards in the nourishment, as a minimum, nepolezno for the health. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Complete failure of the animal products is harmful. </seg>
<seg id="422"> In the animal proteins are contained the irreplaceable amino acids, which it is very complicated to compensate by plant. </seg>
<seg id="423"> It is necessary to necessarily include in ration at least milk or eggs”, is assured dietologist the sea-scape of Bogay. </seg>
<seg id="424"> It cites as an example the fish, that contains irreplaceable fatty acid omega-3. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Richest in it vegetable oil - flaxen. </seg>
<seg id="426"> “In order to consume it in quantities the necessary for the man, it is necessary by liters to drink!” - says dietologist. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Physicians are assured that to the inhabitants of Siberia the special attention for ration must be paid in winter. </seg>
<seg id="428"> In this season the vegetarianism especially is brought into question. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Under the conditions of our realia the high demands on food are imposed. </seg>
<seg id="430"> In order not to freeze, the increased caloricity is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="431"> “If man limits itself on the animal products, correspondingly, this caloricity it is shortchanged”, says specialist. </seg>
<seg id="432"> With this is agreeable doctor-dietologist Olga Poznyak. </seg>
<seg id="433"> It adds, that imported vegetables and fruits - not output. </seg>
<seg id="434"> To man it is better to feed predominantly by the products, which are grown in the region of stay or, where it was born. </seg>
<seg id="435"> The genetic code is disposed to better mastering and over-boiling these products. </seg>
<seg id="436"> And people is in winter desirable not cucumber to pogryzt, but hot supchika or still something posytnee”, explains his position doctor. </seg>
<seg id="437"> According to her, from the fact that they can eat vegany, are properly useful different cereals, groats, bean, local vegetables, apples, which are remained into the winter, frozen berries. </seg>
<seg id="438"> But this, it is unambiguous, it is insufficient for the valuable nourishment. </seg>
<seg id="439"> In the opinion of doctor-gastroenterologist Claudii Arifulinoy, in Siberians in the organisms the level of vitamins is sufficient only from the middle of August on the middle of September. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Complete passage to the vegetarianism under our rigid natural conditions, when temperature can in the twenty-four hours change to 30 degrees and in May snow lies, it is inadvisable. </seg>
<seg id="441"> To organism for the life is necessary energy, and this, first of all, fat”, establishes physician. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Doctors note that veganstvo is especially detrimental for the children and pregnant females. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Children grow, building material is necessary to them, including in the form of the amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="444"> But adhering to vegetarianism, we them give defective. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Pregnant females also need the increased content of protein, vitamins and microcells in the menu. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Their “Veganki they receive less”, is assured Bogay. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Arifulina indicates that the adult person is free to select everything, anything, “to play into those toys, which he wants”. </seg>
<seg id="448"> It has the already formed organism, skeleton, organs. </seg>
<seg id="449"> But children nevertheless must feed valuably. </seg>
<seg id="450"> If parents deprive of some its microcells or of amino acids, selecting for it that the fact that it will be, this is simple disturbance of the rights of child. </seg>
<seg id="451"> “A deficiency in various substances for the development of the brain, sight, bones you will tomorrow no longer restore”, she says. </seg>
<seg id="452"> All interrogated specialist-physicians are agreed in the opinion about the low quality of the reared by winter in the hot-houses and imported vegetables and fruits. </seg>
<seg id="453"> The fact that to us they bring that grown in the hot-houses, contains a smaller quantity necessary microcells of necessary for us, than (grown) in open ground. </seg>
<seg id="454"> “The quality of products is not that”, says Bogay. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Arifulina also notes that the imported and hot-house vegetables and fruits are distant from the ideal standards. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Now and then the desire of producers to gather larger harvest does damage to quality. </seg>
<seg id="457"> “Apples do not become brown in the shear, cucumbers rapidly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and nearomatnye”, gives examples physician, adding, that they, are most likely, stuffed by a superfluous quantity of fertilizers. </seg>
<seg id="458"> And become the suppliers not of vitamins, but cellulose. </seg>
<seg id="459"> With this it is not agreeable with the zavlaboratoriey of the Siberian physicotechnical institute of agrarian problems, the candidate of selkhoz of sciences Vera Petruk. </seg>
<seg id="460"> She indicates that with the correct approach and observance of all standards and requirements in the hot-houses the cultivation of valuable vegetables is possible. </seg>
<seg id="461"> If they try to expel a little more from the square meter, then, of course, and to pour on they will begin more frequently, and to over-feed plants by the mineral fertilizers. </seg>
<seg id="462"> As the example, when too many nitrogenous fertilizers, tomatoes rapidly they grow, they large, but watery and nesladkie”, explain it, adding, that a question of quality, in the first place, depends conscience on producer. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Russia out of the fight for the pollution of cities by the automobiles </seg>
<seg id="464"> The attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in the majority of the megapolises of peace beginning from the second-half of the 20th Century. </seg>
<seg id="465"> As a rule, the discussion dealt either about their reconstruction and expansion of mains or with the attempts to reduce demand for the automobile trips, quantity of automobiles and time of their usage. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Is widely known an example of Singapore, where the rigid apportion of increase in the number of particular automobiles is introduced, and right their acquisition it is bought at the auctions. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Its price can two or three times exceed the price of automobile itself. </seg>
<seg id="468"> European cities, including London, introduced pay for the entrance into the city center. </seg>
<seg id="469"> In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introduce the so-called green zones, where is permitted entrance to only automobiles with specific ekoklassom, which uses also of fuel- high quality (including biofuel or electric cars). </seg>
<seg id="470"> The protection agency of the environment of Beijing, for example, affirmed in 2012 “five-year plan of pure air” with total cost approximately 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion). </seg>
<seg id="471"> As described “&quot;” the director of division on the control of the transport pollution of municipal bureau of environmental protection of Beijing whether Kunsheng, the central objective of the five-year plan - decrease in the leading polluters of air to 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the quantity of particular automobiles to the level of not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), or an increase is not more than by 5% of use of a fuel taking into account one vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="472"> According to the data of agency, now the motor transport in Beijing is critical for 22.5% of general air pollution. </seg>
<seg id="473"> In the number of the control gauges of program - limitation of the use of truck transport, and also the introduction of super taxes for the auto-owners. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Among other things, the urban measures “green five-year plan” include the accelerated in comparison with the remaining country passage for evrostandarty of fuel, introduction of the local system of ekostandartov and marking of automobiles and fuel, limitation to the entrance of automobiles into the center section of the city, prohibition in the use of the obsolete vehicles (furthermore, the creation of the encouraging financial programs of the replacement of old automobiles to the hybrid or electric cars), development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including high-speed). </seg>
<seg id="475"> The number of automobile innovations of Beijing also includes prohibition for all particular automobiles for the motion in the limits of the fifth transport ring (in all in the capital of C.P.R. [Peoples&apos; Republic of China] their six) one day in the week (corresponding information it is contained in the indentification tag of vehicle), and also the delivery of registration signs for the automobiles on the basis of lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the action of lottery, the total number of permissions for the registration of private cars in Beijing it composed only third from a quantity of 2010). </seg>
<seg id="476"> According to the acting state program “protection of environment to 2012-2020”, quantity of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 them it was 138). </seg>
<seg id="477"> According to the data of Minprirody, in 2011 to “mobile sources” it was 41% of all ejections of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities. </seg>
<seg id="478"> In Moscow, for example, the ejections from the automobiles ten times exceed industrial, while in St. Petersburg - nine times. </seg>
<seg id="479"> In RF thus far only they begin to think about the opportunities of the limiting regulation of automobiles on the streets of cities. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The director of the institute of the economy of transport and transport policy of HSE [Higher School of Economics] Mikhail Blinkin considers that the administrative and fiscal measures, directed toward the suppression of demand for the automobile trips, the matter deliberately unpopular, they can be accepted by society only under the conditions of their sheerest universality. </seg>
<seg id="481"> In the case of Moscow appears the unique problem, connected with the structure of its motor park, where are present two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulating to actions - official and personal automobiles, and also the automobiles “privileged” users, whose total number comprises not less than 200,000 (of about 5% of the total number of motor park of Moscow). </seg>
<seg id="482"> Recently urbanists from the center WHAT A in St. Petersburg prepared the study, where the balance of the urban territories between the housing building, area of road surface and quantity of motor transport is analyzed. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Basic conclusions of the researchers: city center is provided for with roads two times of less than required, but the majorities of motorists, which live in the center, do not use automobiles each day, leaving them for a prolonged time on parkings or simply on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="484"> As a result it is proposed to build not parkings, but the depository of automobiles, not to enlarge, but to reduce roadway (so that the streets would be begun by friendlier for the pedestrians), or to limit use and arrangement of the personal transport in the range of the territory of the guarding zone of historical center (by overall territory approximately 3212 hectares, which covers a number of central city districts). </seg>
<seg id="485"> To an increase in the cost of fuel the tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the tax by the extraction of minerals (NDPI) to oil simultaneously with reduction in the export duties and increase in the excises, will lead. </seg>
<seg id="486"> In the opinion of the experts, these measures can bring into the budget the additional of 619.3 billion rub </seg>
<seg id="487"> Trip in mud, rivers and jungle for the rendering to the free medical aid </seg>
<seg id="488"> Doctor Georges Bvelle allows free medical aid in the rural locality in the cameroons </seg>
<seg id="489"> Bvelle and its command carry out almost each output, assuming hundreds of the patients </seg>

<seg id="494"> This person will obtain $250 000 for continuing his salient work. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It saw during 21 year of Georges Bvelle, as its father it returned to the life and again it fell into the unconscious state, wandering on the hospitals, which were not equipped properly in order to help it. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Dzhamef to Bvelle suffered injury in the car wreck in 1981 not far from to Yaunde, capitals of the cameroons. </seg>
<seg id="497"> In it hand was first only broken, but the emergent infection was extended to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded one of itself to the end of the life. </seg>
<seg id="498"> “In the cameroons there were no neurosurgeons, said Georges Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="499"> If we had money, we would export it from the cameroons. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Instead of this Bvelle it for years accompanied its father in the overfilled clinics and hospitals, obtaining any treatment, which they could obtain. </seg>
<seg id="501"> “This is not easy, said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="502"> — You can go out in 5 mornings, come running into the hospital in order to be the first, but you no longer first. </seg>
<seg id="503"> there are very many patients. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Some can die because them is necessary to wait. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Situation strongly did not change from those times, as father Bvelle passed away in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="506"> According to the data of the World Health Organization, in the cameroons only one doctor to 5000 people. </seg>
<seg id="507"> For the comparison, relationship in the United States — one doctor to 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="508"> And even if kameruntsy could turn to the doctor, many of them this would be not on the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Two of five people in this country live after the poverty line, and almost three fourths of expenditures for public health in it are quotients. </seg>
<seg id="510"> “Their only problem is poverty, said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="511"> — And because of the poverty they cannot delight in by their life”. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Seeing the sufferings of its father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle was filled the determination something with this to make. </seg>
<seg id="513"> In the past year doctor Georges Bvelle and its command of volunteers conducted 700 free operations. </seg>
<seg id="514"> It itself became doctor and works as vascular surgeon in the central hospital Yaunde. </seg>
<seg id="515"> It also established the nonprofit organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes the trips to the rural locality along the output for the assignment to free medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Since 2008 it and its group of volunteers rendered assistance by almost 32 000 people. </seg>
<seg id="517"> Almost each Friday it and up to 30 people are filled into the vans, tie to the roofs medical equipment and will go through the broken ground in order to visit the being needed aid villages. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Success does not always them accompany. </seg>
<seg id="519"> It was repeatedly them necessary to push machines across the rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="520"> But when they arrive, them they meet as the real heroes: these are holiday with the songs and dances and the best accomodations, such as local residents only can propose. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Free medical service in these villages is actually occasion for the holiday, and Bvelle with its wide smile and limitless energy more than is happy to be joined to the merriment. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Upon the following morning the brigade begins to assume hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="523"> “We assume 500 people in each trip”, said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="524"> They come from the entire neighbourhood in a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Each of these clinics of leave day allows diverse medical services. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Many people obtain treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, which are transmitted through sex. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Others can obtain crutches, endowed glasses or free evidence about the generation — documents, necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="528"> In the evenings the brigade carries out simple operations under the local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Operations, as a rule, are conducted in the building of school, municipality or in the house; after procedure the patients arise and go into the postoperative zone in order to free place for the following person. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Using a generator for illuminating the operating and sanitary working of equipment, to Bvelle its volunteers work until the early morning of Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="531"> This is difficult rate, but village musicians usually help to support the purposefulness of brigade. </seg>
<seg id="532"> “They entire night beat the drums so that we would keep awake and they continued to work”, said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="533"> On Sunday the members of brigade leave back for the city, tired, but proud by their work. </seg>
<seg id="534"> This group, which consists of the Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their aid can have enormous value for those, they help whom. </seg>
<seg id="535"> One person explained that free operation on the treatment of rupture the obtained by him will allow it again to work. </seg>

<seg id="539"> “I even do not know, when he sleeps”, said To keti O&apos;Melli, the medical student of the second course of the Drekselskogo university in Philadelphia, volunteer in the group Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="540"> It always either in the hospital or attempts to earn money for the organization so that it would be possible to continue these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="541"> _for future doctor and nurse, such as about &apos; Melli, newcomer from USA and Europe, in order to join to Bvelle in realization its task, this opportunity practice, which they never not obtain at home. </seg>
<seg id="542"> “We obtained the opportunity to assist on the operations, where we helped to move away the spots of the blood or to hold tools for doctor Bvelle”, she spoke about &apos; Melli. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Being student-sophomore, you never obtained this opportunity in America. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Student-volunteers usually themselves pay their passage into the cameroons, frequently arriving with the endowed drugs. </seg>
<seg id="545"> But on the arrival in Yaunde their nourishment, transport and instruction pays Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="546"> “He is hero, undoubtedly”, she spoke about &apos; Melli. </seg>
<seg id="547"> It returns its life of this organization, and its desire to help people of the cameroons infinitely. </seg>
<seg id="548"> For to Bvelle almost constant overloading by work is not heavy testing. </seg>
<seg id="549"> To help to live happy life others, to carry out the data to its father promise — this that which brings great happiness to it. </seg>
<seg id="550"> “I am so happy, when I make this work, said Bvelle. </seg>
<seg id="551"> — And I think about my father. </seg>
<seg id="552"> I hope, it sees that I make. </seg>
<seg id="553"> I make this so that the people would laugh in order to decrease their pain. </seg>
<seg id="554"> Visit to the site of ASCOVIME even you will look how you can help. </seg>
<seg id="555"> After “Russian Mafia” in the USA finally was fastened new name - “fraternal circle” </seg>
<seg id="556"> On this week the black list “Russian Mafia” in America was supplemented by new names and four companies. </seg>
<seg id="557"> The Board of Exchequer of the USA introduced into “fraternal circle” three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israeli. </seg>
<seg id="558"> One of the Russians proved to be well-known singer Grigori Leps, whom the USA suspects of the transportation of money for the members of group. </seg>
<seg id="559"> In all in the black list of the USA of 22 people, participating to “fraternal circle”, and six affiliated with it organizations. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Nevertheless many experts express doubts about the fact that this organization actually exists. </seg>
<seg id="561"> “Statement o &apos;by Bratsk circle&apos; more greatly resembles the attempt to combine the separate criminal groups”, previously stated expert on the organized criminality and university professor of New York Mark Galeotti. </seg>
<seg id="562"> In his opinion, “fraternal circle” reflects the popular perception “Russian Mafia”. </seg>
<seg id="563"> “I would meet no one in the Russian law-enforcement agencies or still somewhere, who would confirm existence of this criminal organization”, cites Mr. To galeotti the American Center for a study of corruption and organized criminality. </seg>
<seg id="564"> With Mr. To galeotti it is agreeable and the university professor George Mason Lees with Shelli. </seg>
<seg id="565"> “If they act together, then this greater it is similar to the criminal network, but not organization”, gives its words the Center for a study of corruption and organized criminality. </seg>

<seg id="638"> Children must study myths and legends as “the model of a way of life”, the author speaks. </seg>
<seg id="639"> Legends about Thor could show that “brute force cannot defeat thinned craftiness”, but legends about king Arthur show, as it is important to have a dream. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Indicating that many myths will prove to be “too wild, too scandalous and in certain cases by too obscene for the teaching in the schools”, Krossli-Holland speaks in favor of “thorough selection” suitable texts of the suitable with respect to the age. </seg>
<seg id="641"> “I consider, this is miraculous that in America the myths and folklore are already the part of the formation”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="642"> I spoke in favor of their introduction into the training program of twenty years. </seg>
<seg id="643"> It added that “excessive moralizatorstvo” of the authors and instructors &quot; repulses interest” in children, and basic ideas “subs-whetherpeaceane” into the captivating histories. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Krossli-Holland, whom translated “Beowulf” from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote “the collection of Norwegian myths” for the publishing house of Penguin and “British folk tales”, he said: “In you, of course, there can be intentions, but to you it is better to hold them with themselves”. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Possibly, by the large difference between the adult author, who records for the adult, and the need for perceiving some hope is the adult author, who records for the children. </seg>
<seg id="646"> Not that so that everything must be simplified or lead to the happy tail piece, but it is necessary that there would be the innate understanding of good and evil. </seg>
<seg id="647"> And this must be sub-whetherpeaceANO (Autonomous Nonprofit Organization); it is opened through the history, but it is not clearly formulated. </seg>
<seg id="648"> Old principle: to show, but not to describe. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy </seg>
<seg id="650"> Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks for the main driver of brittle economic growth in Russia - consumption. </seg>
<seg id="651"> These are, first of all, the crisis of nonpayments on the unprovided consumer credits and the mass reductions of workers. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Our main preoccupation now - not that the increase was slowed down, but is faster, the structure of this increase. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Recently it is completely caused by the consumption, which almost not sbavlyaet turnovers”, stated the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs on Russia Klemens Grafe, presenting the yesterday quarterly report of investment bank on the Russian economy. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Now a nominal increase in the wages in Russia - of about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="655"> With the inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand approximately at the current level, they expect in Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="656"> But the profitability of Russian companies falls, therefore, most likely, they will study the optimization of expenditures for personnel. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Today we see a considerable increase in the fraction of wages in the GDP [Gross Domestic Product]: if wages grow by 10%, then the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] - only to 2%, explained Mr. to graph. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Companies encountered the reduction of profitability. </seg>
<seg id="659"> If it does not grow, this can lead to the releases and increase in the unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Wages cannot not to raise Russian business, comments on the Chief Economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) Vladimir Pantyushin. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Unemployment near the historical minimums, competition for the workers is high. </seg>
<seg id="662"> In order to entice colleagues from the side or to hold the current, for employers it is necessary to raise wages. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Consumption in Russia is supported by very rapid growth in potrebkreditovaniya. </seg>
<seg id="664"> To graph, because of the extremely high rates on the consumer loans of multiplicative effect on the economy of the country this form crediting does not render in the opinion of Mr. </seg>
<seg id="665"> “Benefits for the economy from an increase in potrebkreditovaniya we none saw, money not disperse on the economy, but they return to the same banks in the form of the percent payments”, said economist. </seg>
<seg id="666"> But problem in other - in Goldman Sachs they expect an increase in the delay on the unprovided credits. </seg>
<seg id="667"> Them take in essence well-off people, to which something to grant in the guarantee. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Percentages on such loans are high. </seg>
<seg id="669"> As consequence, them more frequently they do not return”, noted Mr. to graph. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Therefore the second threat to an increase in the economy in Russia - possible crisis of nonpayments on the unprovided credits. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The director of the bank institute of HSE [Higher School of Economics] Vasiliy Solodkov even now sees the signs of the ripening bank crisis. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Small credit organizations, without having a access to the cheap resources, what exists in State Banks, were forced to draw means populations under the high percentages. </seg>
<seg id="673"> As the answer the State Banks left to the path of war and they began to decrease credit rates, continues economist. </seg>
<seg id="674"> Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same percentages, otherwise they will have negative percent marzha. </seg>
<seg id="675"> If State Banks do not forego the dumping, to Russia threatens valuable bank crisis, assumes Vasiliy Solodkov. </seg>
<seg id="676"> Economist considers the deprivation of the licenses of a number of banks in the recent weeks the forerunner of mass crash. </seg>
<seg id="677"> “State Banks themselves this situation will not manage: the system of the insurance of contributions was not originally calculated for the system crisis”, prevents the head of institute. </seg>
<seg id="678"> But an increase in the consumption will be slowed down also without the crisis of nonpayments, they assume in the investment bank, because of the failure of the indexing of the wages of civil servants and servicemen, placed in the current version of budget estimate. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Partially impact on the consumption will be softened zamorozkoy of the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by reduction in the inflation). </seg>
<seg id="680"> But only partially: if investments do not grow (but there are no prerequisites for this thus far - see information), an increase in the consumption nevertheless will be slowed down, they are assured in Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not thus far see prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios. </seg>
<seg id="682"> “Main risk - this as before drop in the price of oil”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="683"> According to its estimation, the economy of Russia will begin to be reduced with the cost of oil of below 90 dollars of /barr. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In Goldman Sachs they also noted that TsB thus far cannot decrease the interest rates in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="685"> The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation was reduced, and banks began to raise rates. </seg>
<seg id="686"> This can mean that they did not believe TsB, that declared passage to targetirovaniyu of inflation”, said Klemens Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The percent policy of central bank does not influence market rates, it influences only the rates of interbank crediting. </seg>
<seg id="688"> “For TsB this is the crash of all hopes”, was estimated Klemens Grafe. </seg>
<seg id="689"> The money, obtained at the auctions TsB, banks use not for the crediting of the economy, but for control of their liquidity </seg>
<seg id="690"> As soon as rate is reduced, exchange rate immediately changes, this means that the means attempt to leave on the speculation against the ruble. </seg>
<seg id="691"> “Sooner or later TsB will understand that this strategy does not work”, said Mr. to graph and he remembered that to release the ruble into “free floating” state plans toward the end of 2015. </seg>
<seg id="692"> But it is necessary either to make this earlier or to raise key rate TsB (5.5%), it counts. </seg>
<seg id="693"> According to its estimation, the exchange value of ruble now is artificially overstated to 10%. </seg>
<seg id="694"> To ruble only one road - to weaken, conclusion expert. </seg>
<seg id="695"> But if TsB drops in the financiers the shadow of doubt about the fact that the liquidation of currency corridor - this not part of the policy on weakening of ruble, this can bring ruble down much stronger. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Snouden agreed to give indications about Merkel&apos;s proslushke </seg>
<seg id="697"> The deputy of Bundestag Hans-Christian Shtrebele met to Moscow with Edward Snouden. </seg>
<seg id="698"> In the course of conversation was discussed a question it can Snouden be interrogated as the witness by the Attorney General&apos;s Office of the FRG on business about possible proslushke of the telephone of the chancellor of Germany by spetssltsuzhbami of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="699"> Snouden expressed readiness to give the necessary indications. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="701"> It clearly gave to understand, said Hans-Christian Shtrebele, which knows very much. </seg>
<seg id="702"> And in spite of the fact that the agency of national security directed by whale by Alexander blocked all his movements, Snouden was ready to arrive into Germany. </seg>
<seg id="703"> However, it is first necessary to clearly determine all conditions of its arrival. </seg>
<seg id="704"> Meanwhile, American legislators begin to take measures in response to the scandal around the espionage programs of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Senate committee on reconnaissance yesterday approved the bill, which leads additional constraints to the activity of the American department of electronic reconnaissance. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Fau rockets (v-1, v-2): “Air passengers now can use gadgets on the aircraft (but not to ring from the cell phone)” </seg>
<seg id="707"> Air passengers can use their electronic devices during entire flight in order to read, to work, to play into the games, to look films and to listen to music, but not to say on the cell phones, according to the long-awaited new leading principles, published on Thursday by federal aviation control. </seg>
<seg id="708"> But passengers must not expect that the changes will occur immediately. </seg>
<seg id="709"> As rapidly this change realizes, it will vary depending on airline, the administrator of fau rockets (v-1, v-2) Michael Huerta at the press conference said. </seg>
<seg id="710"> For airlines it is necessary to show fau rockets (v-1, v-2), as their aircraft answer the new leading principles and that they renew their teaching aids for the flight-crew members and rule on piling of devices in order to correspond to the new leading principles. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Fau rockets (v-1, v-2) stated that it already obtained plans from some airlines for the expansion of the use of portable electronic devices in the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="712"> Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines, which already presented plans. </seg>
<seg id="713"> “Depending on the state of plan we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon”, stated fau rockets (v-1, v-2). </seg>
<seg id="714"> At present passengers are obligated to disconnect their Smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as door of aircraft it is shut. </seg>
<seg id="715"> They must not restart them, until aircraft reaches the height of 10 000 feet and captain gives “good”. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Passengers must turn off their devices again, when aircraft is descended for the landing, and not to include them, until aircraft proves to be on the earth. </seg>
<seg id="717"> In accordance with the new leading principles, the airlines, whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic jamming, can permit passengers to use these devices during the takeoff, landings and taxiings, stated fau rockets (v-1, v-2). </seg>
<seg id="718"> The majorities of the new airliners and other aircraft, modified in such a way that the passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, as it is expected, they answer these criteria. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Laura Gleyding, the President of the association of professional flight attendents, greeted these changes. </seg>
<seg id="720"> “After new policy will be satisfactorily realized (but we intend to work in the close contact with the ferryman in order to attain this), this it will be sure version”, stated Gleyding. </seg>
<seg id="721"> We are frank tiredness to feel ourselves “by people on duty on the school”, when the matter reaches this question. </seg>
<seg id="722"> But connection to the Internet for surfing, exchange of electronic letters, by text messages or the load of the data will be nevertheless forbidden at the height less than 10 000 feet, reported agency. </seg>
<seg id="723"> To passengers it will be proposed to switch its Smartphones, tablets and other devices into the regime of aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Thus, as before no “words with the friends” — intellectual Internet-game, into which actor Alek Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the sensational case occurred: actor was taken from the aircraft of the airline of American Airlines for the failure turn off device when aircraft was found at the output for the landing. </seg>
<seg id="725"> But heavier devices, such as laptop computers, as before will have to plot in the luggage compartment, since they can traumatize someone, if they will fly throughout entire salon. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Bells from the cell phone in flight also will be as before forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Regulating authorities on the phone calls belong to federal commission for connection, but not fau rockets (v-1, v-2). </seg>
<seg id="728"> Fau rockets (v-1, v-2) can remove prohibition to some electronic devices during the takeoff and landings </seg>
<seg id="729"> In the past month Mark Rozenker from the National Council for safety of transport, national expert on the safety of the transportation of CBS News, stated that the cell phones are as before considered risk. </seg>
<seg id="730"> “Cell phones — this actually problem, not only because potentially they can create interferences for the navigational devices, but we know because of FKS that they can create interferences for the towers of cellular communication, when aircraft is found in air”, said Rozenker. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Branch advisory board, created with fau rockets (v-1, v-2) for studying this question, recommended in the past month so that the government would permit the wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="732"> In recent years increased pressure on fau rockets (v-1, v-2) for the purpose of weakening limitations to their use. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The criticisms, such as Democratic senator from the state of Missouri Clair Makkaskil, assert that for the prohibitions there are no important reasons, connected with the safety. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The observance of limitations also becomes ever the more complicated to ensure, since the application of devices became general. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Some studies show that to third of passengers they forget or ignore indications to turn off their devices. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Fau rockets (v-1, v-2) began to limit use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to the communications about the interferences for the navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to imply Fm-radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of that time. </seg>
<seg id="737"> New airliners are much more dependent on the electrical systems, than the previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and they are asserted by fau rockets (v-1, v-2) as resistant to electronic jamming. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Airlines propose to passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruising altitude already for several years. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The aircraft, modified for the Wi-Fi-systems, are also more resistant to the interferences. </seg>
<seg id="740"> The overwhelming majority of liners is adapted for the wider use of electronic devices according to the new leading principles, it said Huertas. </seg>
<seg id="741"> Today&apos;s electronic devices usually emit the radio signals much of lower power than the previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Devices for reading of e-books, for example, emit only minimum signals with turning of pages. </seg>
<seg id="743"> But signals become more powerfully, when they load devices or send the data. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among those, who sought the softening of limitations to the use by passengers of electronic devices, there was company Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In 2011 the representatives of company loaded entire airliner by their devices for reading of the e-books of Kindle and they flew on it in order to verify the presence of problems, but so they did not reveal them. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The members of advisory board fau rockets (v-1, v-2) expressed the mixed feelings apropos of that, does present the application of devices any risk. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Douglas Kidd from the national association of air passengers stated that the interferences from the devices consider real, even if risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Other members of committee said that there is only separate communications of pilots, which confirm that the fact that the devices can create interferences for the aviation systems, and majority of these communications is very old. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Nevertheless committee recommended so that fau rockets (v-1, v-2) would permit pilots to require passengers tripping devices during the instrument landings under the conditions of the restricted visibility. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The group of the representatives of tourist industry greeted these changes, calling their sober-minded step towards the passengers, who now use a set of technological devices. </seg>
<seg id="751"> “We are glad, that fau rockets (v-1, v-2) recognizes itself that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with the safety and protection”, said Roger Dawe, the Director-General of the tourist association of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt at to slander the Lithuanian President </seg>
<seg id="753"> Russia is intended to carry out information provocations against the highly placed persons of Lithuania and countries of eastern partnership - this statement to the agency of BNS they made in the department of the state security of republic (DGB). </seg>

<seg id="759"> As intelligence agency asserts, Smirnov under the cover by scientific work prior to the end of 2012 regularly arrived to Lithuania and contacted with the local politicians, political scientists and representatives of media outlets. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Now to Smirnov is forbidden entrance to the territory of the country. </seg>

<seg id="762"> In its opinion, basic from the reasons is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the council of the European Union and “tendency of the country toward the energy independence” </seg>

<seg id="765"> Furthermore, Gribauskayte it charged the head RF of Vladimir Putin with the advancement for Lithuania “some requirements alone”. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Let us recall, in September Rospotrbnadzor {Russian Health Protection and Supervision] stopped the import of Lithuanian “molochki” into Russia. </seg>

<seg id="769"> New anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the process of smoking of the pleasure </seg>
<seg id="770"> Scientists developed the anti-nicotine vaccine, which could deprive the process of smoking the cigarette of pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="771"> One dose of vaccine could protect mice from the nicotine dependence for life. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Further tests prior to the beginning of tests on people are necessary, on that several years will be required, but professor Ronald Kristall from the medical college of Ueyll Cornell to New York stated that the first results encourage. </seg>
<seg id="773"> “We greatly hope that such a strategy of the application of a vaccine can finally help millions of smokers, who attempted to throw, after testing all methods, commercially available today, but they revealed that their nicotine dependence is sufficiently strong so as to overcome it with the aid of these contemporary means”, said professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="774"> New vaccine contains the benign virus, which was developed in order to bear genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to produce the stable flow of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Antibodies trace any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing obtaining by the smoker of nicotine impact. </seg>
<seg id="777"> In the tests the vaccinated mice, to which they subsequently gave nicotine, their normal activity continued. </seg>
<seg id="778"> But the mice, to which they did not give vaccine, “weakened”, and this is the sign of the fact that the nicotine reached their brain, say researchers. </seg>
<seg id="779"> These experiments are described in the periodical of Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Previous tobacco vaccines suffered failure, because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="781"> In order to preserve the high level of antibodies, pricks should have been made so frequently, that they proved to be expensive and unpractical. </seg>
<seg id="782"> But the cost of new vaccine, probably, will be considerably lower, because it converts the cells of the liver into the factories of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it would be possible to give to children before in them will appear the desire trying to cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence. </seg>
<seg id="784"> But is more probable that it will be used by smokers in order to throw to smoke. </seg>
<seg id="785"> “They will know that if they begin to smoke again, they will not obtain from this pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this can help them to get rid of this habit”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="786"> British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they warned that additional studies were necessary. </seg>

<seg id="790"> Frontier Airlines will collect pay for hand luggage </seg>
<seg id="791"> Frontier Airlines is planned to collect from the passengers to $100 for the fact that they carry hand luggage onboard their voyage. </seg>
<seg id="792"> Frontier Airlines is planned to begin to collect to $100 for hand luggage even $2 for the coffee or aeration, although their declaration on Wednesday said, that the passengers can leave to themselves entire jar. </seg>
<seg id="793"> New pay for hand luggage applies to bags in the upper baggage holds; therefore the small bags, placed under the seat, will remain free. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Frontier said that $25 will collect, if collection is paid previously, and $100, if those travelling will pay, having only proved to be at the output to the landing. </seg>
<seg id="795"> The representative of Frontier Keith o &apos; to Melli said that the pay into $100 must force passengers to care about the prepay. </seg>
<seg id="796"> “We do not want to collect pay for this”, she said. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Airlines began to collect pay for the first and second bag, passed to the luggage, in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Passengers, who attempt to avoid these collections, fill as much, as they will be able, into hand luggage, placed into the upper baggage holds, because of what in these sections frequently is not sufficient place. </seg>
<seg id="799"> Collections — one of the methods to force passengers to carry less onboard. </seg>
<seg id="800"> About &apos; to Melli it said that this new collection in reality not for the earning of money. </seg>
<seg id="801"> The fact is that the most loyal clients of Frontier declare, that to find the place in the upper baggage holds is begun increasingly more difficultly. </seg>
<seg id="802"> The passengers, who buy tickets on the site of airline, should not have paid. </seg>
<seg id="803"> This means that one passenger in the turn at the output to the voyage of Frontier can obtain the opportunity to carry bag free of charge, while the following passenger in the turn can pay $100 for the same bag. </seg>
<seg id="804"> About &apos; to Melli it said, that a change in the procedures on the Web site and in the counters of the registration of Frontier to called guarantee, that the passengers will know about the collection before they will reach the output to the landing. </seg>
<seg id="805"> The new collection of Frontier for hand luggage will not begin to be collected of up to years, although the date is not yet established. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Passengers frequently complain about the pay for the luggage and other collections, but their airlines adore. </seg>
<seg id="807"> They assert that working the luggage costs money, and passengers, to which is necessary this service, they must pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="808"> Many in Wall Street count the addition of luggage collections by the sign of the fact that the airlines collect sufficiently money in order to cover expenditures for flights after several years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="809"> However, majority of them did not concern collections for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="810"> Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for hand luggage three years ago, and one additional diskaunter of Allegiant Air more lately followed its example. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Hungarian Wizz Air is only another airline with this collection, said consultant on the airlines Jay Sorensen, who attentively tracks additional collections. </seg>
<seg id="812"> According to its estimation in the report dated December 2011, the collection for hand luggage brings to Spirit $50 million per year. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew by the voyage of Spirit, and to him it was interesting that it will reveal at the output to the landing, when passengers encounter the uncommon collection of Spirit for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="814"> “Landing process was smoothest of those that I saw for my career in the airlines”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="815"> I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and appearance of fight at the output to the landing. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Aircraft was complete, he said, “landing passed swiftly”. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Frontier also follows for Spirit with respect to pay into $2 for the coffee, tea, aeration or juice. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Frontier stated that the passengers, who obtain aeration or juice, can leave to themselves entire jar and that after adding the coffee will be allowed free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="819"> It will as before free of charge give water out. </seg>
<seg id="820"> US Airways brief time attempted to collect pay for the beverages in 2008, but it forewent this in seven months, after passengers began to complain and no other important airline followed its example. </seg>
<seg id="821"> The initiative of Frontier on the levy of pay for hand luggage, when passengers do not buy tickets directly in airline, this her last measure for the attraction of clients to its Web site. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Airlines pay the online-salesmen of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket. </seg>
<seg id="823"> This gave to all airlines stimulus to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly in them, but not to turn into the tourist online-agency. </seg>
<seg id="824"> However, Frontier went further all in this region. </seg>
<seg id="825"> In September it began to give two of less than the bonus miles of the frequently flying passenger to the clients, who purchased the tickets through the online tourist agency. </seg>
<seg id="826"> On Wednesday it cut off the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles of trip. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Thus, the trip to 1000 miles from Frontier, acquired in online tourist agency, would make it possible to obtain 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Furthermore, to passengers it is possible to select place previously, only if they buy tickets directly on the site of Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Frontier has a base of loyal clients in its home town Denver, but its business is reduced and it becomes unprofitable. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Gain was reduced by 9 percent, and flying opportunities were reduced almost by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial sums, published on Wednesday by the parental company of Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="831"> Republic attempts to repair the finances of Frontier within the framework of sale to airline. </seg>
<seg id="832"> Putin attained impunity for his friend of Assad </seg>
<seg id="833"> But now - the news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as they became known today, Israel delivered impact on the rockets of the Russian production, which, according to the communications, were intended “to the Hezbollah”. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Today Syria satisfied important condition - to destroy by November 1 its productions of chemical weapon. </seg>
<seg id="835"> This was made within the framework of the agreement, achieved with the mediation of Russia and allowed the USA not to carry out the military operation, to which they close approached this summer. </seg>
<seg id="836"> It is in more detail about the weapon and about that which means for the Syrian President all this, our main international correspondent Richard Engel will describe. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Washington stated that Assad&apos;s regime will be punished for this. </seg>
<seg id="838"> More than 1400 innocent civilians of, including hundred children, they died in August from the poison gas. </seg>
<seg id="839"> And punishment arrived. </seg>
<seg id="840"> But not in the form of the American bombings, but in the form of the transaction, which arranged the friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Syria will forego its chemical weapon to the middle of the following year. </seg>
<seg id="842"> And today - watershed. </seg>
<seg id="843"> The group of international experts reported that Syria put out of action the declared factories on the production of chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="844"> More long-term and difficult task - this destruction of the tons of chemical weapon and components to it. </seg>
<seg id="845"> As we understand, this about thousand of tons. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Earlier Washington indicated that Assad&apos;s days were considered. </seg>
<seg id="847"> I count, Assad must leave. </seg>
<seg id="848"> A question not in that, will happen this, but in that, when this happens. </seg>
<seg id="849"> It no longer is legitimate and must leave. </seg>
<seg id="850"> But Assad remains. </seg>
<seg id="851"> And it feels itself still more confident. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Its troops as before use artillery, rockets and napalm. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Its enemies are separated and it is badly armed. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Its people vynuzhdenno leaves its houses, many starve. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Certain it is necessary to feed by leaves and cats. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Many assume that Bashar Assad avoided punishment for the mass murder. </seg>
<seg id="857"> Agreement about the chemical weapon is called the success of diplomacy, they awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to inspectors, and Assad himself produced the impression of person, ready to collaboration. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Today in Washington for the ambassador of the USA to Syria it was necessary to answer complex questions. </seg>
<seg id="859"> When child perishes from the hunger, his mother hardly more easily from the fact that him they did not kill with the aid of the chemical weapon. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Assad thus far is held. </seg>
<seg id="861"> And changes weapon by the authority. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Tomich will work out 240 hours for the extremist roller in the social network </seg>
<seg id="863"> The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced 240 hours of the required work of the inhabitant of city, who placed in the social network the videotape of extremist directivity, it reported Russian International News Agency on Friday the representative of the press service of provincial court. </seg>
<seg id="864"> According to the data vessels, in March 2013 the man placed on his page in the popular social network the video recording, which was introduced into the federal list of extremist materials. </seg>
<seg id="865"> In the relation it was excited the criminal case for article Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “the actions, directed toward the excitement of hatred and enmity, and also toward humiliation of the merit of man perfected publicly”. </seg>
<seg id="866"> “Leninist district court examined this matter in the special order and recognized man as the guilty of the commission of the crime pointed out above, after appointing punishment in the form of 240 hours of required works”, said the interlocutress of agency. </seg>
<seg id="867"> It added that the man completely recognized his fault. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The parents of interseksualnykh children can select “indeterminate gender” </seg>
<seg id="869"> Germany became the first European Country, which recognized the third gender in children, originated with intermediate type external sex organs. </seg>
<seg id="870"> To the newborns no longer they will necessarily assign masculine or feminine sex. </seg>
<seg id="871"> New law does not require parents to call any gender of such children, making possible for parents to indicate gender as “not determined” or “not established” in their evidence about the generation. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The purpose of law it was to remove pressure from the parents, who can make hasty decisions about the operation on awarding of gender to newborns, and counteract discrimination of interseksualnykh people. </seg>
<seg id="873"> One interseksualnyy person, according to BBC, it said many years later: “I am not man and not woman”. </seg>
<seg id="874"> I will remain the created by doctors flap article with the bruises and scars. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Approximately one of two thousand children, who are born yearly, is neither boy nor girl. </seg>
<seg id="876"> They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathologic states, which fall under the diagnosis “of the disturbance of sexual development” — collective term for the people with the atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or uncommonly developed external sex organs. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Uollis Simpson was, possibly, interseksualom. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Gender identification, until now, is insufficiently studied; however, the majority of experts in the USA indicate that, if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the entire existing information and to appropriate it, than to wait and to track the psychological and physical development of the child before conducting of operation, if generally this occurs. </seg>
<seg id="879"> New York psychiatrist, doctor Jack Dresher, who specializes in the problems of gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds as a good idea”. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Interseksualnye children create ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="881"> “Some people have the threatening life disturbances, which require operational interference; however, the majority of their children does not have any”, he, said. </seg>
<seg id="882"> You can appropriate gender without the operation and then look, as personality is developed. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The science about how in child will develop any gender identity, is not too precise. </seg>
<seg id="884"> No one can answer the questions of why this occurs. </seg>
<seg id="885"> This as puzzle about why people are homosexual. </seg>
<seg id="886"> The report, sent for the European Commission in 2011, describes interseksualnykh people as being differed from the transseksualnykh or transgendernykh, since their state refers not to genderu, but to their biological structure, which corresponds exclusively neither to masculine nor feminine sex, and it is typical for both simultaneously or not characteristically nor for one of them. </seg>
<seg id="887"> These characteristics can be manifested in the second sexual signs, such as muscular mass, the distribution of hair cover, breast and build; the primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of the chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Report also gives general idea about discrimination, which encounter interseksualnye and transgendernye people in the sphere of employment, and also about the level of oppressions, cruelty and crimes owing to the prejudices. </seg>
<seg id="889"> The boys with the gender deviations now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Australia and Nepal already permit adult to place man, female or “third gender” in their official documents. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In June 52 the -year inhabitant of Australia Norri Mey-Uelbi became the first in the world person, acknowledged “sexless”, defending in the court right on the retention “indeterminate” sexual status for life. </seg>
<seg id="892"> According to the communication of the ministry of internal affairs, in the German passports will be used the third designation in addition to M and F — the X, i.e., interseksualnyy. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In adjacent France gender questions still cause contradictions, according to news release on the channel of France 24. </seg>
<seg id="894"> In 2011 ten legislators from France, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed petition about the withdrawal “gender theory” from the school textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The American Web site of Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, after writing that “in the situation, when peace is pulled into the new state, where the gender is the object of selection, and sexual activity is not, we turn over the two additional pillars of civilization”. </seg>
<seg id="896"> One mother of the newly born child of Maryland also reported to the Web site of Baby Zone that she would prefer so that to the children would be established gender with the generation. </seg>
<seg id="897"> “To raise child is sufficiently heavy without the additional constraints, especially if you do not know the gender of your child”, she said to Web site for the parents. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Stability and confidence are necessary to children. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Historically children, originated with the male and female sex organs, were called hermaphrodites — by the name of the beautiful Greek god, who possessed signs of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> And still only ten years ago medical association received gender as the sheet, on which it is possible everything to erase, and then again to draw. </seg>
<seg id="901"> But now many dispute ethical bases for the surgical operation, knowing that the gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make incorrect selection, without knowing, as child will receive the appropriated to it gender, when it grows. </seg>
<seg id="902"> “In the middle of XX century this was called “the pressing psychiatric case””, said rag thrasher. </seg>
<seg id="903"> When such children were born, you rang not to psychiatrist — you rang to surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="904"> The prevailing theory about how to turn with the children with intermediate type genitalia, was proposed by doctor John Mani from Jones&apos;s university Khopkinsa, which considered that gender easily yields to change. </seg>
<seg id="905"> It introduced into the rotation term “gender identity” and asserted that the signals of environment, including social — that, as parents they raise child, interact with genes and hormones of child, determining, will man consider himself man or woman. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theories proved to be open to question. </seg>
<seg id="907"> It advised to the parents of boy, whose penis was damaged during the negligent cutting, completely castrate child, after removing also his eggs, and to raise him as girl. </seg>
<seg id="908"> “Mani presented the case as a successful example of passage, but this was not so”, said rag thrasher. </seg>
<seg id="909"> When to boy there were about 15 years, it again became boy and it was married the woman. </seg>
<seg id="910"> But into 38 years it committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Rag thrasher said that now some doctors still &quot; use this model”. </seg>
<seg id="912"> But in the 1990&apos;s, with the arrival of the Internet, people, which survived these operations on the change of gender, they stated about itself, “dissatisfied by result”. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Was such the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year writer from the state of Montana, which was born with the man chromosomes of XY, but intermediate type genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Doctors could not accurately determine, there were by Li Wu it a large clitoris or small penis, and they were convinced that it never will be able to live “valuable life” of man. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Therefore soon in 1976 external sex organ and eggs of Bruce were surgical removed after its generation, and it brought up as girl. </seg>
<seg id="916"> It began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="917"> “I knew that I am not girl”, he described ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="918"> I was unfortunate, but it was very complicated to pose questions. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In 18 years to it was assigned vaginoplastika. </seg>
<seg id="920"> But being found in depression and understanding that something not so, it required medical documentation. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The fact that it learned, was terrible. </seg>
<seg id="922"> I was sterilized with the generation, and no one told never to me about this. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Bruce was born with the disturbance of sexual development, which did not give to his body to perform sufficiently genitalia testosterone for the normal development. </seg>
<seg id="924"> After learning truth, it again became man, obtaining the pricks of testosterone and after removing its breast. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Operation made its barren. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Today it comes out in defense others in the organization by the name of Interface Project, attempting to lead the perception of people with the intersexuality into the standard. </seg>
<seg id="927"> But Anne Temar-Mettis, executive director of California juridical association Advocates for Informed Choice, is perturbed fact that the German law “impels to the mounting of labels and stigma”. </seg>
<seg id="928"> “Many activists are perturbed fact that the German law will impel parents to make hasty decision and to give to child “the indeterminate gender””, she said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We fear, that it will contribute to interference. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We consider that it is better to appropriate masculine or feminine sex, and then to wait. </seg>
<seg id="931"> But we yet did not see, as will appear itself this law; therefore everything that we can make, this to build assumptions. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Temar-Mettis said that its organization supports Australian law, since “it makes possible for adult people to make a selection in favor of the third gender”. </seg>
<seg id="933"> “Adult people must have the capability to make their own decisions about the formal sexual belonging”, she says. </seg>
<seg id="934"> German law implies its awarding with the generation. </seg>
<seg id="935"> This is the battle, into which small children must not enter in this stage. </seg>
<seg id="936"> When they grow, then they can make decisions relative to their own body. </seg>
<seg id="937"> But Dr. Arlin Barats, mammolog-roentgenologist from Pittsburgh, in which there is a daughter with the disturbance of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the group of support, she said that the German law will &quot; support” both the parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="938"> The daughter of Barats, To keti, was born with the man chromosomes; however, it has a disturbance of sexual development by the name “syndrome of complete insensitivity to the androgens”. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Since its androgenic receptors incorrectly work, in To keti developed female signs. </seg>
<seg id="940"> It has a sheath, but there are no womb and ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Now, into 29 years, To keti married passes permanent appointment in children&apos;s psychiatry to the university of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It is barren in spite of the fact that, it hopes to become parent by means of adoption or gestatsionnogo surrogate motherhood. </seg>
<seg id="943"> “Law gives to parents time in order not to assume the hasty solutions themselves”, said Barats. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It gives to them time to make some analyses and to be dismantled into the situation, and also time interval before they will write “man” or “female”. </seg>
<seg id="945"> In that case you in the order — grow child, you love child. </seg>
<seg id="946"> You have a wonderful child, and you perceive happiness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We should in a hurry make the operation, which is not reversed. </seg>
<seg id="948"> “This makes possible for children to participate in the solution and removes the unrest, which moves by parents, because they do not feel, that they enter correctly”, she said. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Finally child will solve, with what gender to him or by it is more comfortable, this is noticeable. </seg>
<seg id="950"> This gives the opportunity to make a decision to children independently. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Secretary of State of the USA: intelligence agencies now and then “went too far” with the data collection </seg>
<seg id="952"> The Secretary of State of the USA John Kerry recognized that with the data collection and proslushkakh the American intelligence agencies now and then “went too far”, nevertheless politician noted that the appeared in media outlets information about proslushke 70 million people does not correspond to reality. </seg>
<seg id="953"> I assure you, that the innocent people in the course of this process did not suffer, but the attempt to gather information was. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Yes, in certain cases this went too far and it bore incorrect nature. </seg>
<seg id="955"> I recognize this, as it recognizes and the President… and we will follow the fact so that this it would not occur in the future”, it cites the Secretary of State of AFP. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experts of equestrian measures, who assemble into cardiff in order to battle for the prize “the horse of year”, knew that the competition will be very high. </seg>
<seg id="957"> But no one was ready to the appearance of three-year-old Fentona Kirklanda. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Even not schoolchild, only for several months to this made his first steps, this little-one with his ward by the shetland pony of Toffi at a trot rushed past through three stages in order with the ease to take main prize, after leaving 30 adult rivals far behind. </seg>
<seg id="959"> This inseparable of para- identical increase — obtained appreciations for the exterior view, behavior and style at the yearly competition, which is carried out by the center of the horse sport of Sannibenk in Radri city not far from cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="960"> After leaving to the universal review against the background of men and women in the elegant hat-pots, it moved its aslant cap and proudly it conducted in the circle of two-year-old Toffi. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Judges praised Fentona after it entirely not over the years the developed innate abilities of rotation with the horses. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But Toffi obtained the highest estimation for the exterior view and nature. </seg>
<seg id="963"> To Fentonu they presented to Toffi on its third birthday in March of last year, and from those times it was occupied with the shetland pony each day. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Its 30-year mother of Donna said: “Fenton and Toffi compose excellent duet”. </seg>
<seg id="965"> They had many rivals, but these two left the gold goblet and rozochkoy. </seg>
<seg id="966"> This was only its second appearance from Toffi, and we everything were excited, when it won. </seg>

<seg id="1003"> The Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that the prices in the country considerably will be lowered after the country it will sign agreement about the association with the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> About this he stated in the course of communication with the readers of its page on “Facebook”. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> I can definitely say that the prices are determined by the large number of factors, among which there are, including and customs payments. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> So here, after the signing of agreement and coming into force of position about the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties in merchandise import from the European Union considerably will be lowered. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> But this will mean that and the prices must be lowered. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> “This concerning goods, which enter from the countries the European Union”, wrote Azarov. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> However, as far as other goods are concerned, influence of agreement on the prices will not be such straight line, it will be defined by example. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> But, nevertheless, there also there must not be price hike. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> Therefore communication on bilbordakh, which recently sufficiently much appeared in our country, that association with the European Union - this is an increase in the prices, this not entirely so, or if we more precisely say - entirely not then”, summed up Azarov. </seg>

<seg id="1013"> Federal Government insists on what the packet of rescue measures in size of $325 of million for the weakened system of public health of Tasmania will be augmented by the merciless terms, which guarantee, that the government of state will not spend means for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> The Federal Minister of public health Tanya Plibersek it declared, which collaboration assumes “urgent measures” in order to avoid the crisis, caused by aging the population of this island state, by the higher level of chronic diseases and by the limitations of system. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> The solution about the financing for four years was accepted after the consultations of government with the independent deputy of Tasmania Andrew Wilkes. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> “Government proposed the packet of special rescue measures, which, we believe, it will solve particular problems, confronting the state”, stated today Mrs. Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Packet with size $325 of million includes $31 million to the blitz campaign on the planned operations. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> 2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and operations in terms of the removal of cataract, will help to overcome delay. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Are also money for the clinics, which assume patients without the preliminary record, in Khobarte and Lonsestone, for an improvement in the quality of withdrawal after hospital, the instructions of medical specialists, security services of mental health and introduction of the systems of personal electronic medical charts in the local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> “These investments will go on those expressed by progressive-minded doctors the realization of ideas about how it is better to help the system of public health of Tasmania”, said Mrs. Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Minister it insisted, that the government of Tasmania will work in the regime of a strict account and responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> To state will have to support the current levels of financing in order to obtain the cash resources of collaboration, and to monthly report about that, where it spends these additional means. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> Will be created commission of three people, in order to ascertain that the state allows services how more effective as possible and it is more efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Mr. Wilkes stated today that $325 will solve million nothing, “if them does not follow the authentic reform, which will place the system of public health of Tasmania on the steadier basis”. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> Nevertheless it praised government for the answer to its request about the urgent aid, with which it for the first time turned to the Prime Minister into the beginning of May. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> “I hope that the packet of federal aid will considerably contribute to the output of the system of public health of this state from the critical state”, said Mr. Wilkes. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> According to the data of the government of state, these additional selective procedures to a considerable degree compensate recent reductions. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> But federal opposition representative on public health Peter Datton considers that today&apos;s statement is “the solution, similar to adhesive tape”. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> “The reason, for which we here, lies in the fact that the Labor Government of state pulled out $430 million of the system of public health”, he said the television network of ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> When the government of state tears off almost half-billion dollars, and collaboration packs 300 million, it cannot be been shut that these are good news. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Mr. Datton requested Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee, that not one dollar of the rescue packet will be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Cry of the desperation of the voter of Obama </seg>
<seg id="1033"> I voted for President Obama twice, dividing hope for the opportunity of the changes </seg>
<seg id="1034"> He indicates that Obama allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to bring together on no praiseworthy efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Obstructionism cannot serve as the justification for problems with the Web site of that reformed by Obama the system of public health, attack of the drones </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Memoirs about the campaign of Obama 2008 are sad reminding about that which could be </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Nathaniel P. Morris — student of the second course of the medical department of Harvard University. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I read the terribly sad book during these days. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> I thought that this book will inspire me in the times of despondency in the second course of medical department and will revive in me a feeling of hope. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> It is called “impudence for the victory”, and these are memoirs about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When I in the evening conclude to write reports on my patients and bed into the bed, this book returns me when policy inspired millions of people, and appearances could seize spirit. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Victory on the elections proved to be impressive, and those leading of news programs made pause for the comprehension of this historical moment. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> My classmates cried from happiness, while my parents coast all newspapers, which they only could find. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> In the White House had to arrive the young command of strategists, and people was ready to changes. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> During Obama&apos;s entry into the post in 2008 his level of support composed 82%. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Then I shut the book. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recovery at present is rough awakening as extraction from the dream. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> It is difficult to recall those days of optimism — they seem by distant memory, by sad reminding about the missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> In the years, which passed from those times, as I lowered my first ballot, changes actually occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> This was that I even could not visualize. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> I return proper for his great and diverse achievements to Obama, from the adoption of law about the accessible medical aid to the removal of our servicemen from Iraq, the cancellation of rule “do not ask, do not say”, the murder of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Moreover, I consider that the party obstructionism blocked too many at attempts the advance of our country forward: immigration reform, the opportunity of the selection of state public health and closing base in Guantanamo among other. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> But after the countless number of times, when I occurred on the side of Obama&apos;s administration, protecting it before the colleagues and contemporaries, in me ended the explanations, which I can grant. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> I reached the point of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain permission to proslushku of foreign leaders or inflicting of impacts by drones according to the innocent children in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> It cannot explain the data collection about the private life of Americans by the agency of national security or pursuit of exposers, who reveal incorrect government&apos;s actions. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> It cannot explain the murder of the American citizen of Anwar al-Awlaki without the court and consequence or the nonobservance of the limits of state financing and expenditures during the presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, in which it is indicated that the applied by the White House efforts, in order to make it necessary to become silent media outlets, are “most aggressive… from the times of the administration of Nixon”. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> And recently it cannot justify that the fact that does not succeed in developing the simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of law about the accessible medical aid. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> I do not know, this to me it was to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Must was I at the age of 18 years understand, that the management can contradict the political campaigns, which it do precede? </seg>
<seg id="1062"> It is obvious that the work on the elected office is not the predictable activity plan, since our public dialogue will be formed with opposition political party and such random events as slaughter in Newtown. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> Nevertheless on all by enumerated by me above to examples it is evident that they were to a considerable degree their own selection of administration. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> And this that which disturbs me most of all. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm apropos of his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Mitt Romney was incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed that it cannot make a decision by its own policy or views. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I assumed that within his second period Obama, after being freed from the pressure of future elections, will justify the hopes, about which we heard during this long time. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> However, when on this week Obama&apos;s rating descended below 45%, to return in 2008 by means of this book it began considerably more difficultly. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> This forces me to long for many promises, which were evaporated. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> On this week I read that part of the book, in which he is described, as Clinton it applied to Obama deafening defeat on the primary elections in Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> At the meeting according to the analysis of causes for failure he said to its colleagues that they must return into the normal river bed and remain true to their purpose. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> “I want so that we would return our attractiveness, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> — We must remember about that, who we”. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> It passed five years, Mr. the President, and I with you am completely agreeable. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Opinions expressed in this commentary belong to exclusively Nathaniel Morris. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> In Egypt the first freely elected president takes the oath </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Mohamed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration will hardly signify by itself the end of political struggle in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised “new Egypt”, when he brought oath, after becoming the first freely elected president of the country, after replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was thrown down 16 months ago. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and fifth Head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of monarchy of approximately 60 years ago at its inauguration before the supreme Constitutional Court of Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> It accepted the oath before 18 judges in the black mantles in court building on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> “We strive for best future, new Egypt and second republic”, said Morsi during the solemn ceremony, shown live on the government television. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> “Today Egyptian people placed the bases of new life — uncontrolled freedom, authentic democracy and stability”, stated Morsi, 60-year engineer with the American formation from “the Muslim Brotherhood”, Fundamentalist group, which large part of 84 years of its existence was the forbidden organization, which served as target for the rigid actions of the changed each other governments. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Building guarded hundreds of soldiers and policemen, when Morsi arrived with the small cortege soon after 11 mornings local time. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Only several hundred supporters were assembled in court building in order to greet the new President, and, in contrast to the presidential pump of Mubarak&apos;s times, motion was stopped only to the short period in order to pass his auto-transport group along the usually lively road, which connects city center with the southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Although Morsi they ridiculed as nekharizmatichnoe “spare wheel” “brothers”, his personal prestige sharply grew from the moment of his victory and Friday appearance, in which it attempted to present itself as the candidate not only of Islamists, also all those, who want to bring the matter of the uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak to the end. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> “Today Egypt is civil, national, constitutional and modern state”, said Morsi, dressed in the dark-blue business suit with the red necktie, to judges in the sheathed by wooden panels hall, where he accepted oath. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Later than Morsi it was directed to the Cairo university, where it had to pronounce its inauguratsionnuyu speech. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> To it was shown official method with the army orchestra, which carried out the national anthem, during which it stood on the counter “quietly”. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Was present military man field marshal Hussein Tantawi. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> Its arrival was encountered by slogan “army and people — one hand”, which they scanned hundred gathering in the main lecture hall of university. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> The based in 1908 as stronghold of secular formation, Cairo university in the 1970&apos;s years became the stronghold of Islamic student groups. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Morsi accepted symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, where was conceived the uprising, which completed the authoritarian administration of Mubarak in the past year, and it promised to return the authorities of the President, of which his post was deprived by military council, which accepted the matters from the thrown down leader. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> But after agreeing to accept the official oath before the court, but not before the parliament, as is customary, it carries out the will of servicemen, and this is the sign of the fact that the power contest will continue. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> The speech of Morsi on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Schools issued a call to pay greater attention to mathematics, orthographies and to the grammar </seg>
<seg id="1096"> The school courses of English literature will require that the students would study at least one play of Shakespeare, the novel of XIX century, romantic poetry and contemporary British artistic literature since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> At the examination will be also represented “extra-program texts” in order to encourage more extensive reading. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> The united course of English literature and language will be abolished. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> Since 2015 students will be obligated to pass separate final examination on the language, with the persistent recommendations of the selection of English literature as the separate examination. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> The department of formation must tomorrow release new curricula in the English and mathematics — to first objects, subjected to radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> It will introduce changes in other basic objects in the following year. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> The separately control in the sphere of the examinations of OFQUAL will present the reviewed structure of the final examinations of secondary school, with the new system of estimations and smaller volume of course works. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> Coming out as summer, Minister of Education Michael Gouv said that there was “they will reach the wide consensus in the fact that we must reform our system of examinations in order to return public confidence”, insisting, that the school final examinations will be “more complex, more ambitious and stricter”. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Studies show that the English schools give less than the time mathematician (116 hours per year, or three hours in the week during fourth), than in the majority of the countries. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> For the comparison — Australian schools give on the average 143 hours per year, and in Singapore students are occupied about 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> Although formal requirement to give more than time in the timetable mathematician it will not, sources in the coalition said that scale school final examinations in mathematics in combination with the increased coefficient in the table it was rating, they will most likely serve as stimulus for the assignment by the schools of additional instruction on this object. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> In the training program more than attention will be given “to the tasks from the real life”, including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> Football - reason for dissension? </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In the State Duma of the within the framework “open platform” of policy and the experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Among the proposals was sounded similar: to forbid football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - some scandals and dissension. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Speaker Sergey Naryshkin remembered about the recent events in Biryuleve and said that for reduction “in the degree of tension in the society” of policy and media outlet they must be correct in the statements. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> Probably, it had the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, which in one of the telecasts threatened to surround the Caucasus by barbed wire, if there they do not want to limit birth rate… </seg>
<seg id="1113"> All appearing spoke both about the measures for the regulation of migration from the countries of CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and about the measures for the harmonization of the relations between the peoples, which populate Russia, which gave discussion confusion. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Maxim Grigoryev stated that event in Biryuleve - “the model conflict, which could be forecast”, but “for these questions answers too many people and instances”, and in seven nurses child without eye. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The concept of multiculturalism, which long time in the attitude of migrants practiced Europe, in the opinion of the public worker, fell through, and it is necessary to search for its way. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Historian Yuri Petrov laid large hopes for the new united textbook of history. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> “It is still necessary to create benefit on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that the schoolchildren in Tatarstan would know that after people they live in Daghestan, and vice versa”, it reported. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Gennadiy Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for “calls to the breakdown of Russia”: “If we in the USA say on the radio that it is necessary to return Alaska of Russia, then you they arrest and will give 20 years of prison!” </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Vladimir Zhirinovsky greatly tried “not to kindle”. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> As usual, of everything it accused the journalists, who will carry sick and acute national problems to the public discussion: “In to the flame of controversy it is small whether that it is possible to say!” </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The leader of fraction “United Russia” Vladimir Vasil&apos;yev here advised to journalists to conclude “charter” and to agree news conversations on this theme accurately, and then the same obligations can take upon themselves and policy. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Are accepted about 30 laws, which regulate migration, and order as a whole is established, Mr. Vasil&apos;yev stated. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> As an example it gave the law, which lays on the regional and municipal authorities responsibility for international peace in their territory. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> But Ludmila Andrichenko enthusiasm apropos of this law it did not divide: in it there are no “clear ideas about the fact that such is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> It means, subjects will treat differently the volume of these authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Moreover the municipalities do not have personnel, necessary for resolution of such complex questions, there are no means, and the systematic recommendations, which they could use, center does not give to them… </seg>
<seg id="1127"> The head of Duma committee on the matters of nationalities Gadzhimet Safaraliev it proposed to create special department with the terrible name “ministry of national security”, which would deal with questions of national policy. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> But Valerie Tishkov, who in the 90&apos;s headed similar department, abolished subsequently, came out against. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It suffices to have at the federal level of special person, “minister without the briefcase”, to which it would be possible to turn, if that. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> “We walk along the edge, projectiles vomit by a number, it is very important to the representatives of different ethnoses and religions to together speak against provocations, and this work must obtain worthy information support”, said the representative of the ROC (Russian Orthodox Church) for connections with the society of Vsevolod Chaplin. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> No neutrality of state with respect to the dangerous ideologies, religious including to be, in his opinion, it is must. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Here Oleg Nilov it took away discussion into the unexpected river bed: “More talented people than in Chechnya or Daghestan, still looked must be, but them they push not to that way, not to that road”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> “Not that road” - this is the development of the football: “First football player they beat up to entire crowd, first flags plait, then comrades cover by the stones of each other… </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Maybe, is not necessary to us this football? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> There is another form of sport - rugby it is called… </seg>
<seg id="1136"> “Equal to them it will not be in the world in this form of sport!” - hotly spoke spravoross. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Rugby in the Caucasus no one will be! - here interfered Mr. Zhirinovsky. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> You another kerling to them will propose! </seg>
<seg id="1139"> It is necessary to know national special features, this nevertheless that to Georgian “Dnieper Cossack” to propose”… </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In Yaroslavl&apos; wild behavior on the platforms were characterized by the representatives of Moscow club - during the game with the local club. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Football it is necessary to forbid in the entire country… </seg>
<seg id="1142"> The acknowledgements of the agency of national security strengthen paranoia of corporations with respect to the state shadowing </seg>

<seg id="1144"> In accordance with instruction the Federal Service of the protection of constitution (BfV), service of the internal reconnaissance of Germany, its task it was photograph the roof of the building of the representation of the USA, which is found less than in 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> German media outlets indicate that BfV hoped to reveal the antennas of the overhearing devices, and these actions involved the talks between the USA and ministry of foreign affairs of Germany in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> James Klepper, director of national intelligence of the USA, in September again certified, that the USA does not use the opportunity of external reconnaissance “for the embezzlement of the commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies in order to increase their international competitive ability or to increase their profit”. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> But from those times, as Edward Snouden — contract employee, who became exposer — began to publish his treasure-house of the secrets of the reconnaissance of the USA, European government and the leaders of companies no longer were assured, is it possible to believe to director for the word. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Communications, that the national security agency of the USA followed the Brazilian oil company of Petrobras and was obtained access to the given, stored in the suppliers of cloud services USA, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia of corporations, caused by the shadowing of state, to the new heights. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Last drop became information about the fact that the telephone of the chancellor of Angela Merkel was heard, possibly, about ten years. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If most influential persona of Europe can become target, then, of course, potential targets are the leaders of business. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Snouden made obvious intensive collaboration between the intelligence services of the USA and companies. </seg>

<seg id="1154"> German companies are convinced that the USA now presents very nearly the same risk as China, in the region of industrial espionage and embezzlement of the data, according to the study, published in July by the consulting agency of EY. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> In all documents, opened by Mr. Snoudenom, nevertheless, until now, there was no evidence of the fact that the USA transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Politics they expressed apprehension fact that the European Union specific opportunities in region of information technology and Internet are not sufficient, and they expressed the opinion that it one should attempt to decrease its dependence on the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Businessmen skeptically relate to this. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Someone in the parliament of Germany indicates that we must create German Google. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I can only shut eyes and slowly open them again… </seg>
<seg id="1160"> “This is not version”, says Gasso Plattner, the President of the German of the company-supplier of software for the business of SAP. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> If there is a need for powerful European IT-industry, did not cost to make possible for it to die more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to the automobiles and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Everything, except IT-industry. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> And nevertheless the scope and technical state of development of agencies for espionage of the USA, which became known because of the revelations of Snoudena, were shock for some companies, which earlier thought that the largest risk of shadowing represents China. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Large shift occurs in the cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies better realized, that the data, which are stored in the USA, are found in the same jurisdiction and therefore it is potentially vulnerable. </seg>

<seg id="1173"> Leaders corporations do not usually love to brag by those reciprocal measures, which they undertook, since this can grant advantage to enemy. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In the important companies has already long ago been mastered the thought, what to take free flash drive at the exhibition or to leave laptop computer without the care in the number of hotel — this, at least, is inconsiderate. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Ulrich Khakenberg, the member of the board of directors of the auto-building company of Audi, says that already many years this the standard practice — to gather the cell phones before the sessions of administration, so that they could not be used as the overhearing devices. </seg>

<seg id="1177"> The Predoplachennye cell phones subsequently are ejected. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Nevertheless there are the fears that the small and average companies remain vulnerable for the breakings and shadowing. </seg>

<seg id="1281"> However, on November 1 the figurante of the affair “of OboronServis [Defense Service]” destroyed silence. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In Vasil&apos;yev&apos;s interview for Life News she stated: “Task was originally, of course, exactly one: to take out of me any negative information in the attitude of the former Minister of Defense”. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> There was blackmail to the object of the fact that I must give indications, they will otherwise me plant into the prison. </seg>

<seg id="1285"> Further we go into the court, we will prove its innocence. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> In the victory we are assured by 100 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> In this case of the interview it is possible to draw the conclusion that, perhaps, most of all to Vasil&apos;yev caught the words about that which in it is unimportant with the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Probably, has the statement of the official representative of SK (Investigative Committee) RF Vladimir Markin, that in the collection of pictures, which gathered the figurante of the affair “of OboronServis [Defense Service]”, were revealed forgeries. </seg>

<seg id="1300"> What did serve as reason to the revelations located Vasileva of located under the house arrest, until now, of that not associating with the press? </seg>
<seg id="1301"> Possibly, as woman it could not but answer the charge in the poor taste? </seg>
<seg id="1302"> But or are right the journalists “of members of the Komsomol”, who asserted the pair of days ago, that it “is hollow into even larger trans- under the house arrest” because of the information about the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with the wife and his return to the bosom of family? </seg>

<seg id="1440"> But here ONK to Rostov-on-Don can switch over from human rights activists to power figures. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> From the new lists “disappeared” the human rights activist-chairman of local commission, then one of his opponents proved to be, in spite of the fact that in May 2013 the federal Public Chamber excluded it for the unethical behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> The lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshev considers “vengeance for Kopeysk”. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> The disclosures of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not influence ONK of Mordovia, which considers it “power”: one human rights activist wanted to fall only in the new composition, and in it even did not accept documents for the competition. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The member of advice OP of Nikolai Svanidze described to RBC [RosBusinessConsulting] daily that he voted against the list proposed, since it agitates situation in Moscow and to Rostov-on-Don. </seg>

<seg id="1586"> “NSA.gov was inaccessible for several hours this evening because of the internal error, which occurred during the planned renovation”, reported reconnaissance agency in the official electronic letter. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Problem will be solved this evening. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Statements, that the stoppage in the work was caused by the distributed attack of the type “failure in the maintenance” [DDoS], were incorrect. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The previously this evening online-systems of monitoring servers registered, that the site of ANB did not work at least six hours, and site is as before inaccessible for some users. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> The previously representative of ANB reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of agency was &quot; by no means &quot; broken up. </seg>

<seg id="1592"> At least one online-group of hacker-activists stated that it bears responsibility for incapacitation of the site of ANB with the aid of the DDoS-attack. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> DDoS-attacks are developed so as to whip purposeful site by traffic as long as servers do not occur overloaded and site does not go out of order. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> The tactics of hackers is relatively simple, but attacks are not intended for the penetration into the internal network of purposeful system. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> Previously super-secret ANB, which once received nickname “there is no such agency”, it proved to be in the recent months in the center of public attention and bitter criticism afterward the turns of revelations about its extensive programs of shadowing abroad, also, inside the country — all this is reaction to the secret files of ANB, stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former colleague of ANB Edward Snouden. </seg>

<seg id="1607"> Agency “Rosbalt” they deprived of status media outlet for the unquotable swearing </seg>
<seg id="1608"> On October 31 Moscow City Court decreed to recognize as ineffective license about the registration of agency “Rosbalt”, writes “tape”. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On the deprivation of the agency of status media outlet insisted the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications - for the systematic and outrages about the media outlets. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> In the course of the process the unpleasant precedent was created: court calculated by the possible to shut media outlets, having actually refused to publication in the right to advance counter-arguments. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> That such “Rosbalt” </seg>
<seg id="1612"> A privately held company “the information agency of Rosbalt” was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> During the subsequent years agency opened the second head office in Moscow and number of regional subdivisions. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Also in agency work representations in the countries of the former USSR. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Since 2001 “Rosbalt” was developed and functioned as federal information-analytical agency. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> To the middle 2000-X the agency entered into the list the most learned particular Internet-media outlets in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> With this “Rosbalt” it always filled the sufficiently specific niche: the nucleus of the exclusive publications of agency composed (they comprise, until now,) notes with the reference to the sources in the law-enforcement agencies. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Conversations about the proximity of publication to the primary structures continued for entire elongation of existence of agency. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Together with the fact that “Rosbalt” possessed the extensive base of sources in different departments, in favor of such assumptions spoke the fact that in the chapter of project it stood Natalie Chaplin - wife of Victor Cherkesova. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> In this case the role of Chaplinoy in the leadership “of RosBalt” to the end is not clear: most frequently it is called “the leader of project”. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> By the Director-General of agency is Larissa Afonina, editor in chief - Nikolai Ulyanov. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Recently “Rosbalt” figured in the ratings of federal media outlets - neither on the citability nor on the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In October agency occupied the 25th place in the rating of hit of sites Russian media outlets on the version of LiveInternet. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> According to the data the same LiveInternet, the average-daily audience of site rosbalt.ru composes about 150,000 unique visitors (and to 500,000 it is review), monthly - about three million unique visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> In the number of most popular materials for the recent five months - note about the helplessness of the Kremlin in the relations with Ukraine, deaths of the soloist of group “king and chutes”, pogroms in capital Biryuleve. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The conflict “of RosBalt” with the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications began in July 2013, when they came into force of correction to the law against the media outlets, which forbade unquotable swearing, to journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Department revealed the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the site of agency videotapes (“Djigit from Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot they defiled petroleum towers”). </seg>
<seg id="1628"> The future of side is described differently. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications on the basis of discovered video materials accused “Rosbalt” of the gross and systematic disturbance of law about the media outlets and turned into the court with the requirement to select in the agency license. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In “RosBalt” they declared, that the claims of department were incorrect: first, rollers were not editorial materials, in the second place, maternye words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after warning rollers were removed from the site. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> The representatives of agency appealed the claim of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications in the world court - and when on October 22, 2013 Moscow City Court accepted the action of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications, the examination of these complaints still continued. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> However, already 25 numbers world judge made a decision not in favor of “RosBalt”: editor in chief Nikolai Ulyanov they recognized as the guilty of the disturbance of code about the administrative offenses and fined to 20,000 rubles - on 10,000 for each roller. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Obviously, this decided beforehand the outcome of hearing in Moscow City Court - if we forego ourselves the thought, that the outcome could be decided beforehand still earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> On October 31 court made the decision to recognize as ineffective evidence about the registration “of RosBalt”, having actually deprived the agency of status media outlet. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> It cannot be said that “Rosbalt” in the course of this opposition remained in the solitude. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> Agency supported Deputies of the Gosduma (statement to the name of the head of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications Alexander Zharova on October 10 they signed 26 deputies; document itself was given on the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation). </seg>
<seg id="1637"> On the illegality of closing publication declared the head of the union of the journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Pavel Gusev and head of presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> And what is more according to Bogdanov, the leadership of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications even granted to it some guarantees of the fact that the matter will not reach the opinion of license. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The court above “RosBalt” showed: under whose jurisdiction more safely to be found to the mass media in Russia today - a large question. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> The gene of speech proved to be the stimulator of the formation of the synapses </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Scientists from the university of John Khopkins and medical school of Mount Sinai revealed the protein, therefore “the gene of the speech” of Foxp2 achieves its function, stimulating the formation of the new connections between the neurons. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> A study is published in Science, on the site of periodical it is possible to read its summary. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The gene of Foxp2 is first known the genome, whose function is directly connected with the speech. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> To establish its role it was possible in 2001 because of the detection of family from several man, which could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes even they themselves did not understand each other. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Scientists explained that in family members was disrupted the work of the gene of Foxp2; however, it fulfills its function how, it remained not known. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> In a new study the biologists showed that at least the part of its functions of Foxp2 makes as the stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the region of the brain, speech connected with shaping. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Achieves this it because of another gene, SRPX2. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The latter was discovered as a result of the search for the factors, which stimulate the formation of synapses. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes, found by the authors, in this case only to its activity viyaet Foxp2. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> That that SRPX2 actually influences vocalization, scientists confirmed in the experiment on the little mice. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> When in animals the activity of gene was artificially lowered, they less shouted during the separation with the mother. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> If the activity of gene was restored, was restored the frequency of the published sounds. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Earlier on the mice was also shown connection with the vocalization itself of Foxp2. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Animals, by which was introduced the human copy of gene, squeaked more actively, also, at the lower frequency than usual mice. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Until now, however, the scientists do not know, is connected the work of Foxp2 and, correspondingly, controlled by it SRPX2 with the purely “mechanical” properties of the formation of sounds or thinner processes. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Ponomarev left “a Just Russia” </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Deputy of the State Duma from the party “Just Russia”, member of its department in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev gave statement about the output from the political organization. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> As parliamentarian stated, he gave statement to the Novosibirsk regional department of party. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> According to its regulations, this automatically means that Ponomarev left numbers “of spravedrossov”. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> We sit, we drink tea… </seg>
<seg id="1661"> “For some reason many want to see picture “Ilya Ponomarev it places to the table party membership card”, but in this there is nothing such epochal”, commented on deputy his solution. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Ponomarev noted that he preserves good relations with the regional department “of socialist revolutionaries”. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Meanwhile Ilya Ponomarev to reject is not intended the mandate of Deputy of the Gosduma. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> It explained that, in spite of the leaving the party, it remains the member of fraction and according to the law it cannot it leave. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Communications about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave party “Just Russia” appeared on October 30. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> It communicated that together with it “sr” they will leave Dmitriy Gudkov and Valerie Zubov; however, the latter it soon refuted this information. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> You do want ice cream luminous in the darkness? </seg>
<seg id="1668"> British owner created the first in the world luminous in the darkness ice cream with the aid of the jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of marine animal in order to develop the luminous food. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> It arrived at this idea, after reading scientific article about the jellyfish, and it convinced scientists of China to chemically recreate the luminous protein. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Ice cream enters into reaction with the language of that, who eats it, increasing the level of pH in the protein and forcing him to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Chris says that since ice cream begins to shine, when it reacts on heat- mouth, this means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Charlie, the founder of company for the production of ice cream “lick me, I tasty”, he says: “This is improbable thing, but still in the quite initial stage, if we speak about the production; therefore for £200 you will obtain about 2 g of substance”. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> The protein, which we is utilized in the ice cream, enters into reaction with your language with neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> Therefore, when your mouth warms protein, this will promote of pH and ice cream will begin to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> We tested it in the course of several recent months, and it seemed that it will ideally present it into Khellouin, because it creates this remarkable luminous effect. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> This, possibly, the most expensive ice cream from those that I made, because luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> So that each ball costs me near £140. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Then it sufficiently pleasant to the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The experimental company of Charlie, located in Bristol, is famous by its uncommon tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of tinsel gold. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> But its following creation must prove to be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> He said: “I greatly want to develop invisible ice cream”. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> This regarding is impossible because of the refraction, caused by the crystals of ice, of which the ice cream consists, but I think that we will find the method to make this. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by the Chinese scientists, </seg>

<seg id="1898"> International inspectors left for Syria after in the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 in the course of gas attack they died, according to the data of the USA, is more than 1400 people. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> The primary task of inspectors it was not to lose time - in order not to allow Syrian authorities to produce more than chemical weapons - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing of chemicals and equipment of ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> Now they will attentively observe these production capacities in order not to allow their repairing. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The following landmark - middle of November: by this time OZKHO and Syrians must coordinate the detailed plan of the destruction of the already existing reserves of the toxic substances. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> there are here many questions. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Where they will be destroyed? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Who will grant for this equipment? </seg>
<seg id="1905"> All Syrian statements will be checked thoroughly by Western intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> They with the willingness advise to inspectors new objects for the checking, if bases will suspect, that Damascus not to the end is frank. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> The USA assumes that this firing was carried out by the regular troops. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Syria and Russia insist, that this affair of the hands of Syrian rebels. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The world community required of Syrian leadership - in accordance with the understanding, achieved with the mediation of Russia, to destroy or to put into the nonoperating state all power for the missile production, poison gases and liquids and for the filling of projectiles with these substances. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Now, when this stage is travelled, next step must become the destruction already chemical weapons of already available in the Syrian Army. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> It is assumed that in this arsenal there can be more than 1000 tons of the neuroparalytic toxic substances, blister mustard gas and other forbidden chemical substances, which are stored in several ten different places. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> For its destruction it is necessary that OZKHO and Syrian authorities for the beginning would agree on graph of actions - two weeks are removed to this. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The leader of field operations OZKHO Jerry Smith stated to the BBC that its inspectors “personally controlled the destruction of equipment”. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> “They now do not have opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapon”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In the statement OZKHO it is indicated that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and were convinced of the fact that the plants for the missile production and toxic substances either were destroyed or they were given unsuitable. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The remained two objects are too dangerous in order to conduct there inspection, it is spoken in the document, but equipment was from there transported and checked by specialists OZKHO. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> According to Smith, the process of the destruction of infrastructure on the production of chemical weapons was “is especially complex”, since it was necessary to work under the conditions of the continuous conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> At the beginning of October OZKHO was obtained the Nobel Peace Prize; however, according to Smith, time to finish celebrating this in inspectors thus far it was not located - they were too occupied with work. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> George Kerevan: gap with Europe gives the selection to Scotsmen </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Already one day, one additional horror story about the independence. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> They this time us warn that independent Scotland will have to be joined to the Pan-European zone of the free displacement as the condition of membership in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> The turn of histories about the passport control in Bervic and boundary with the barbed wire along Adrianov of shaft comes. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> True, the newspaper of Strathclyde the possible economic benefits from the freer displacements over remaining Europe, although — what is predicted — this did not appear in the titles. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Anyone also the fact that the member nations the European Union spend much time on that in order to turn its formal rules in the manner that by them this is convenient. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Since Scotland now does not enter into Schengen zone, the continuation of the nonobservance of requirements will become cheap concession for Brussels instead of that, what he actually wanted from the Scotsmen. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> So that this is not noteworthy history. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> And such trying that it became the fossilization: for the first time I heard “duck” about the fact that “the independence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> And nevertheless there is the interesting moment, lost with the retelling of ancient fairy tale. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Why generally independent Scotland must fulfill the orders of Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Why to change the yoke of London by the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Here are present the European news: great postwar plan to combine Europe at long last was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> The project “Europe” is officially dead with evrokrizisom. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> In entire European Union of the parties, which speak against the European Union or in favor of the cancellation of the Euro as common currency, is gathered the force. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Even in Germany the party of evroskeptikov “alternative for Germany” — based only in this year — appeared from it from anywhere and obtained almost five million voices on September federal elections, thus in the essence after extruding “free Democrats” (analog of our “Liberal Democrats”) from Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> There was always an internal opposition to the plan of the creation of federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Nevertheless the current economic crisis became critical moment. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The measures of austerity, introduced by Berlin and European Central Bank, and fetters, superimposed to the national economies through the retention of common currency, led many people to the thought, that the project “Europe” visited too far. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The crisis of the Euro little is connected with the fact that the national governments work with the excessive budget deficits, this was correctly only for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> In reality evrosistema blocked its members in the exchange rates, advantageous for the German exporters, that German politicians want to preserve. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Without the opportunity of the devaluation of national currency South Europe occurs in the previously unfavorable position on the production potentialities in the comparison with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Only rescue means — to reduce wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The deeper problem of the productive capacities of Europe costs after the current problems of budget and currency. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> As a result of the package of measures for “green” energy, inculcated by Brussels, the cipher, which indicates subsidizing the French and German energy companies due to the user, European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for the gas, than in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> These are paralizuyushche unfavorable price conditions, as we already saw in Greyndzhmute. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> No wage freezes will in the world stop the crushing victory of cheap schistose gas of the USA above the European petrochemical industry. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> As a result ripens riot, especially in France, once most ardent supporter of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> After war French political elite considered the European Union as the method to control Germany and to place Paris on one level with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> But Berlin no longer needs Paris as in the means of obtaining political legitimacy, and it already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, after leaving the destroyed economy of France in the miserable situation. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> Result — the right-wing, speaking against the European Union party Marine Le Pen “National Front” recently won the decisive additional elections, after dropping the ruling party of socialists in the third place. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> “Front” now is most popular party in France with 24 percentages of votes — timely warning to British laborists about the fact that it cannot be proceeded from the assumption that the division among the right automatically will be said in favor of the leftists. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> What does make Le Pen with his novoobretennoy popularity among the French white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> She wants to use elections in the European Union in the following year in order to create block in the European Parliament against the European Union and against the common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> If — and this very probably — the disposed against the European Union parties will obtain support on these elections, this block will be able to for the first time occupy dominant position in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Here is my opinion: the soon growing moods against the European Union and against the common currency in Europe will merge together in order to destroy the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The European Union it will not disappear, but it will again become something like the diffuse “Europe (sovereign) nations”, which pleased General de Gollyu. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Germany several dependent on it economies can preserve the Euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I assume that Great Britain distances itself from this project, hoping to draw together with the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Nevertheless the growing interest of Washington in Pacific Ocean indicates probability that Great Britain will remain without the attention in cold of the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> In what position this does leave Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1960"> We can select to become the region (in the essence) of small England. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to chertyam. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> I suspect, that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of the freer European understanding when we will preserve our currency. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Collaboration with other country-like-minded people will be more simply in nefederalnoy Europe nations. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> It is otherwise for us worthwhile to examine the opportunity of repeating the experience of Norway and retention of our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> The government of Scottish national party in Scotland appears — however it is strange — by the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against the measures of austerity, which received impressive majority of votes in 2011 because of the objections against the spending cuts, proposed (and realized) by Labor Chancellor of the Exchequer by Alisterom by Darling and by emergent subsequently coalition of Tory and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Of Scotland it would be now absurdly vote for the independence only in order to take the measures of austerity, imposed on Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="2043"> Early sexual ripening: aging is earlier </seg>
<seg id="2044"> African-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach sexual maturity earlier than their white contemporaries, show studies. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Physical changes do not mean that the sexual ripening is close </seg>
<seg id="2046"> There is no evidence of the fact that the hormones or other chemical substances are guilty </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Experts consider that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the starting gears of the early sexual ripening </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Tendency toward early sexual maturity is not so expressed in the boys </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Former correspondent of CNN Pet Eteridzh — journalist, who specializes in the children&apos;s health and questions of family. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> One should mother be frightened, if in her daughter do begin to be formed the rudiments of mammary gland and grow pubic hair into 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2051"> At the annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics on this week into Orlando, state of Florida, children&apos;s endocrinologist doctor Pol Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are sufficiently extended among the American girls and are new standard. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> “I conduct much time, calming down parents — usually this does not indicate the rapid offensive of complete sexual maturity”, said Kaplovitts. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair and smell of body, appear earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> But there was only small displacement at the age to menarkhe (first menses) for a period of recent four decades. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> In the United States middle age is 12.5 years and it was lowered in comparison with 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> “After breast begins to be developed, passes at least two or three years to menarkhe”, said Kaplovitts, which is also been the author of the book “early sexual ripening in the girls: as to manage this extended problem”. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Time — most precise checking of that how sexual ripening will progress. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Is conducted the discussion, that is the actual offensive of sexual maturity, but it is considered as the “premature”, when an increase in the breast is accompanied by a sharp increase in the increase of up to 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> In the majority of the cases the process will be slowed down or will pause itself — this that the pediatrician can track attentively. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> More rapid progression can serve as base for the analyses in endocrinologist in order to exclude serious problems, such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> There are procedures in order to detain early menses and to avoid one additional consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which in the final analysis can lead to the retardation of increase and low increase at the ripe age. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Recommendations regarding medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of child, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Psycho-social aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Kaplovitts is careful with the medicines, but it recognizes that “the suppression of sexual ripening can soften behavioral problems and sensations of girls, that they differ from contemporaries”. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Another big problem is intelligible: parents simply do not want so that their very young daughters had menses. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> “They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they will manage questions of hygiene”, said Kaplovitts. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> “This was shock”, recalls one woman, in daughter of whom menses began into 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Although there were the signs and we spoke about menses, she was not emotionally finished. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> It arrived home from the school by the frightened and detuned fact that it the first among its friends. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> There are many widely proclaimed theories about the reasons for early sexual ripening. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Nevertheless there are no sequential proofs of the fact whatever that are guilty the hormones in the milk or other food, chemical substances in the environment or sexual promises in the mass media. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> In boys — and in girls — sexual ripening begins earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Kaplovitts asserts that the prerequisite, which has the greatest weight, this epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> In 2001 it helped to conduct the study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects a quantity of fat in the organism with the periods of sexual ripening. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Others data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other facilitating factors. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> In this country African-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach sexual maturity earlier than their white contemporaries. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> There are different explanations. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> In the entire world early sexual ripening, in all likelihood, influences everything: from the economic conditions and climate to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Another puzzle: although in boys the hair on face and on the pubes appear in the younger age, tendency toward the complete early sexual ripening is not so expressed as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Other doctors, who participate in the conference of AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The appearance of pimples and pubic hair is encountered even in babies and children of crib age. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> “We must be careful relative to that how we determine the true offensive of sexual maturity”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, children&apos;s endocrinologist in the children&apos;s hospital of Gorieb into g. of Morristaun, state of New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> Parents must not be troubled to obtain indications from the pediatrician about how to speak to its child. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> “This can indicate earlier than it was expected, conversation”, explained Kaplovitts. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> If you preserve calmness, your child will, as a rule, react well. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> To the girls, who bloom early, necessarily the confirmation of the fact that even when this occurs earlier than assumed, this process it is the normal part of the life. </seg>

<seg id="2443"> In the owners of pawnshops in Singapore of the matter they go well, while middle class experiences the difficulties </seg>
<seg id="2444"> In the pawnshop in the shopping center of Bendemir in Singapore of Dzhanani Amirtkhalinga embeds gold bracelet, ring and links in order to pay school instruction in its daughter. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> “My husband and I recently purchased house, so that all my money inserted there”, says Mrs. Amirtkhalinga. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Although it earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as the administrator and its husband also works, monthly family income it is not sufficient, she speaks. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Actually, demand in different parts of southeastern Asia —, where the volume of the debts of household economics grows — it is such, that ValueMax, where it carries out its transaction, on this week became the third pawnshop, registered on the Stock Market of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> Credit under the guarantee of jewelry articles — this is the not simply rapid method to obtain money (S$1300 Mrs. Amirtkhaling&apos;s in the case), but also almost so it is cheap as the unprovided bank credits. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Usually pawnshops in Singapore add to effective annual interest rate in 17% — scarcely higher 15.4%, proposed in the department United Overseas Bank, local creditor with the branch in the same shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require checking solvency or proofs of wage and can issue credits more rapidly than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Therefore millions of people in the entire region turn into the pawnshops, since the families feel pressure because of an increase in the cost of life and rapid growth in the debts of household economics and consumer debts. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> After five years of the steady increase, which followed after the global financial crisis, and the cheap credits, which were being made up by free money and credit policy in the countries with the developed economy, the families with the low and average income level turn into the pawnshops in order to compensate the decrease of incomes in proportion to the retardation of an increase in their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> On this week of Standard &amp; Poor &apos; s, rating agency, was indicated an increase in the family credit arm, in essence because of an increase in the mortgage, as the factor of risk for solvency of Asian banks. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest relationship of the debt of household economics to the gross domestic product in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Malaysia headed this list with 80% of the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] in comparison with 60% in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Economists are also perturbed by the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which on this week hardly left the technical recession. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The data on Thursday showed the continuous reduction in the export and weakening consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> “They are in the fact that with an increase in the prices people in the middle and lower part [scale of incomes] will search for the methods to supplement their incomes, where only they will be able”, says Song Seng Vun, the economist of CIMB, Malaysian bank. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Record high prices of gold in last two years strengthened the hurry, with which the people embed their personal effect, since they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family adornments. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> In Singapore about 70% of things, embedded in 200 pawnshop points of city-state, are gold articles. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> People speak: “Price of gold appears grow prettier, give let us place the gold chain of grandmother we will obtain it conversely in the following month”. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> In Thailand the largest operator of the pawnshops of EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of clients, who use its departments in the recent months, up to 20%. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Increase in the pawnshop business is such, that ValueMax, the operator of department in Bendemire and 15 others the same in Singapore, plans to be enlarged not only in adjacent Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also beyond the limits of Asia also, does speak Yeakh of Ching, the executive director of ValueMax. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> Company will finance expansion, using 60 percent from S$66 of million, drawn on this week as a result of the arrangement of actions on the Stock Market of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> While some creditors caused the fire of criticism because of the high interest rates, Mrs. Yeakh says that the pawnshop not only proposes cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also does not increase debt directly. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> “Clients embed the objects, which they already manage, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase the debts of household economics”, she says. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> Pawning conquers ever wider public acceptance as the means for obtaining the short term, provided for financing. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> And in this case pawnshops not only those categories of people, which are located in the difficult financial position, use. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The rich in Singapore also use departments of ValueMax, embedding gold ingots or hours of Rolex, which can give to 60 percent of their purchase cost available. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> We see clients of all layers of society. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> “They include the well-off persons, to which it is necessary to engage money for the short time for the commercial projects either investments or enterprise of the small business, to which it is necessary to overcome temporary money difficulties”, says Mrs. Yeakh. </seg>

<seg id="2493"> To Russian power figures nothing it is known about the group “fraternal circle” - new Proceedings </seg>
<seg id="2494"> INTERFAX.RU with the reference to the informed source in the law-enforcement agencies RF writes about this. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> “After in media outlets appeared communications about the introduction by the Board of Exchequer of the USA Lepsa in check list on the suspicion of membership in Eurasian criminal syndicate &apos;fraternal circle&apos;, we examined all databases, but such group they did not reveal”, said the collocutor of agency. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> In his opinion, the propagation of this information contributes to the maintenance of myth about the so-called Russian Mafia, who allegedly acts abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> As they wrote earlier “NOT”, yesterday the Board of Exchequer of the USA published on its site the list of the assumed members of criminal group “fraternal circle”. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Among them was named Russian singer Grigori Leps. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> It figures in the list as “Grisha”, they laid out the day before. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> They coincide with the data of popular Russian executor. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Are indicated precise name - Grigori Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of generation. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Besides Lepsa, are there mentioned additional five men. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> Two Russians, the citizen of Israel, the citizen of Uzbekistan and one additional descendant of the former USSR, whose citizenship it is not indicated. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> IN the USA they are assured that Grigori Leps, who lives in the island It pkhuket it transported for the bandits of money on their order. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> To this communication the photograph of singer is applied and are indicated all his data, which correspond to reality. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Moreover, Leps actually recently purchased house on You pkhukete. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> In the department they noted that they were intended to introduce sanctions with respect to Lepsa. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The recording of man onto the black lists of American Minfin (Ministry of Finance) entails the blocking of its assets in the USA and prohibition to the business connections with it of those, who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Assistant Lepsa to the Mayas Serikova stated that no information to the singer it entered: “It is complicated to answer a question, that this Grigori, about whom everyone speaks now in connection with the scandal in the USA”. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Everything that knows Leps - this information media outlet. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> Officially to it personally there were no information whatever, although I do not know, there are they in such cases. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> “And, of course, this all, from one side, is ridiculous, and with another - it is amazing and unexpectedly”, she stated Russian International News Agency. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> According to her, on You pkhukete Grigori Leps it does not live, but, as asserts Minfin (Ministry of Finance) of the USA, house in the Thailand island in it actually exists. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> She stated that now Leps is located in prolonged stage through the Far East and Siberia, and that the news found it during the overflight into Blagoveshchenk city. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Black box in your machine? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> The thus far American designers of roads attempt to find money to the repair of the scattered system of highways, many begin to see the solution in the small black box, accurately attached on the instrument panel of your automobile. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> These devices, which track each passed by motorist mile and transmitting this information to officials, are in the center of a questionable at attempt the modernization of the obsolete system of financing the highways of America, undertaken by the planning agencies of Washington and state. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Usually the dull arena of planning highways unexpectedly gave birth to intensive debates and picturesque alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Libertariantsy were joined to the ecological groups in the lobbying of assignment to the government of the right of the use of small boxes for the tracking of a quantity passed miles of passed by you and even, possibly, that, where you pass them, and the use then of this information with the composition of tax calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Motion of tea drinking in the shock. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The American Civil Liberties Union also is deeply perturbed and raises number of questions relative to private life. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> And although congress thus far cannot agree, continue or not, several states to wait are not assembled. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> They reflect, as during the following decade it is possible to switch over to the system, with which the drivers pay for each mile of road, which they pass. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Thousands of motorists already took for testing these black boxes, part from which they have a function of satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This is actually necessary for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> “This is not that question, on which there can be the option”, said Khasan Ikhrata, the executive director of the association of the governments of South California, which prepares plans with respect to the beginning of tracking by state government of the miles, passed by each California motorist, by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> There will be changes in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Technologies for this already exist. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The need for this is aggravated by the absence of means in the government fund for the building of highways, financed due to the taxes, which the Americans pay on the auto-servicing. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Americans no longer buy so much gasoline, as it is earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Automobiles pass more than miles by one gallon. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Federal tax itself, 18.4 cents for the gallon, did not rise already 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Politics they do not want to increase tax even to one cent with the high prices of the gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> “Tax to the gasoline simply cannot be preserved”, did say Mannich, expert on the transport policy at the university of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> In its state it was recently established on the automobiles of 500 tracking devices for testing of the system of pomilnoy payment. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> “This will be the best alternative in the long-term outlook”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Zanudy call this pomilnoy user pay. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> It is not surprising that this idea draws urban liberals, since with the aid of the taxes it will be possible to change the nature of trips for reduction in the overloading of roads and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Planning agencies in California look at this system in the course of developing strategies for achievement of the purposeful indices, established by the ambitious laws of this state on the fight with the global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> However, the member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of the transport committee of chamber, said that he also examines this system as the most viable long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The adherents of the free market in the fund “for Reason” also in the enthusiasm from the fact that they will force drivers to pay for each mile. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> “This not is not simple the tax, which it will depart to the black hole”, said Adrian the MUR [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department], Vice President on political questions of Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> People directly pay for the fact that they obtain. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> This motion is also supported by two former ministers of transportation of the USA, which in 2011 called congress to move in the direction of pomilnoy payment. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The senate of the USA affirmed in the past year pilot project with the cost of 90 million dollars, in which would participate of approximately 10 000 automobiles. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators, who represent voters, which in the daily life it is frequently necessary to pass many miles in order to reach to the work or into the city. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Several states and cities, nevertheless, go along this way independently. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where for the participation in the largest experiment in the country are drawn 5000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> These drivers will soon pay state for the miles of path instead of the tax to the gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> In Nevada pilot project is already completed. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> In New York it is examined. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Illinois tests it on the limited basis with the participation of trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> But the coalition it is i-th-95, into which enter the transport departments of 17 states of East coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), he studies, as they can conduct these changes. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> This concept did not obtain universal acclaim. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> In Nevada, where about 50 automobiles of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were perturbed fact that the government can track each of their steps. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> “Apprehension apropos of “big brother” and similar things is big problem”, said Alauddin the khan, who manages by questions of strategy and control of effectiveness in the department of the transport of the state of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> This was not that people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When dispatch tests full speed, the department of the American Civil Liberties Union in the state of Nevada warned on its Web site: “It is entirely simple it will be simple convert these devices into the instruments of full-scale tracking”. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> There is no need for creating the enormous, bulky technological infrastructure, which it will be unavoidable to be enlarged for storing the records about the daily displacements of individual citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Nevada - one of several states, where are conducted the difficult searches for inexpensive technology, which would allow state government of news the calculation passed miles of the passed by automobile, but without the information about the place and time. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> If you are able to make this, the khan said, society will feel itself more quietly. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The searches for this technology brought some agencies of state to the small young company in California by the name of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Originally this company did not deal with assistance in the collection of the taxes of state. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> It was attempted to leave for the developing market for the form of auto-insurance, with which the drivers pay on the basis of path. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> But the devices, which it will test, draw the designers of roads, because they do not use GPS and allow the limited quantity of information, periodically loaded with the aid of the modem. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> “People will be inclined are more to do this, if you do not track their speed and do not track their position”, said Ryan Morrison, the executive director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> There were several larger than errors in some of these pilot programs of state. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> There are much the less expensive and less obsessive methods to make this. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> In Oregon the designers experiment with the assignment to the drivers of diverse variants. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> They can select device or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Or they can entirely forego the device, after deciding instead of this to pay the fixed collection on the basis of the average number of miles, which pass all inhabitants of state. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> In other places they hope to sell the idea of the alerted community, after forcing devices to make more, but not less. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> In New York transport officials attempt themselves to develop the nalogooblagayushchee device, which will also assume payment for parkovochnym counters, allow “pay, as you drive” insurance and to gather the pool of the data about the speed in the regime of real time from other drivers, which the motorists could use in order to avoid plugs. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> “Motorists will assign on the participation the benefit, which to them they will propose”, it is said in the document of city-planning design. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Some designers of transport systems, however, think about that, are not all conversations about the pomilnoy payment the simply enormous distracting factor. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> In the urban transport commission in the region of San Francisco bay the officials say that the congress would can very simple to overcome bankruptcy of the confidence fund for the building of highways, after raising taxes to the gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> It would be possible to collect additional one-time or annual tax from the drivers of the hybrid automobiles and other persons, whose vehicles much gasoline do not use, so that they would pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> “There is no need for the radical surgical intervention, when everything that you should make, this to accept aspirin”, said Randy Rentshler, the director of commission for legislation and social relations. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> If we make this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Pope Francois will name the first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Pope Francois will elevate into the dignity of the new cardinals of Catholic Church for the first time in the period of his service on February 22, as declared on Thursday the Vatican. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after dad, and precisely they select dads, so that Francois will assign his first group of people, which will in the final analysis participate in the selection of its successor. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> At present there are 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> However, after reaching by the cardinal of 80-year age it no longer can participate in the elections of dad — this is the prerogative of group 120 “of cardinal-voters”. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Declaring this news, the press-secretary of the Vatican the father of Federico to Lombardi said that before the ceremony of erection into the dignity will be carried out the meeting of all current cardinals, known as consistory. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> “Pope Francois decided previously to report his solution to call consistory in February in order to facilitate planning other conferences with the participation of cardinals from the different corners of peace”, it said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Jack Valero from the organization “Catholic voices” said that by February the number of cardinal-voters, probably, will be lowered. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> He said that usually dad calls as many cardinals, as is necessary to again bring the number of cardinal-voters to 120, and also as many cardinals at the age it is older than 80 years, as it will wish. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Consistory in the following year will have great significance, because it will first be from the moment of Francois&apos;s election in March this year according to the Valeras. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> At the given moment there is its kind a bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> “It will interestingly look, will appoint new dad of cardinals from other regions of the world for restoring the balance”, he noted. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> In South America they live forty percent of catholics, but they are represented by the negligible number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> This will also be the first selected cardinals from the time of forming Francois the council of cardinals — group of eight cardinals from entire world, to which it is charged to search for the methods of reforming the church. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> In the past dad solved everything independently. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> “Now Francois selected eight cardinals so that they would help it”, said Valera. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> He said that “it is completely possible” that Francois will turn to the cardinals for the council. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> But we were not in this situation thus far — all this for us for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Valera said that dads usually raised into the post of the cardinal of bishops from the large arrivals, but Francois “was full of surprises — therefore we do not know, whom it will name”. </seg>

<seg id="2610"> Tax for the foreign owners of real estate will lead to the fact that the London bubble will break </seg>
<seg id="2611"> Treasury carried out the preliminary estimation of measure for tax to increase in capital, but it expects the final solution from Mr. Osborne, who in the budget of 2012 introduced the rate of the state duty in size of 7% for the houses with the cost of more than £2 of millions and yearly payments for the buyers, who decide to manage houses in the comradeship, but not as the physical persons. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> At the given moment of gosposhlina to the home in the regions Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was 708 million pounds in 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds sum total on North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and Khamberu together. </seg>

<seg id="2614"> “But this step can lead to the fact that some foreign investors will unwillingly buy real estate in London or its current owners they will not want it to sell”, it added. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> The cost of first-class real estate — upper 5 10% of housing market on the price — in the rich southwest belt of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbleton, grew to record 11.8% in the past year. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> According to a study of the company of Savills, price in the center of London they continued to demonstrate steady increase in size of 5.6% in the annual calculation, but them eclipsed actively developing “domestic market” with the splash of prices on the southwest, on north (7.4%) and to the east of (6.5%) city. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The current session of the association of the machine builders of Tyumen&apos; Oblast took place on the base of Yalutorovskogo motor vehicle plant. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> The presentation of new line for the production of electric welding pipes made of steel took place within the framework of the measure. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> As described the commercial director of enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the advent of new owner is carried out a marketing study on the market exploration for the sale of steel constructions in Tyumen&apos; Oblast. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> It was explained that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welding pipes per month. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The solution about a change in the plant production structure and installation on it of equipment for their production was accepted after this. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Already in this year more than 7,000 tons of produced production are dispatched. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Investments into the plant comprised more than 120 million rubles, described Denis Gribanov. </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Is in October neglected new camp, which makes it possible to increase assortment. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> At the plant is produced as the small profile of pipe, which is used for the hot-house economy, the small forms of building and in the furniture industry, so also large - for the construction branch. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> We plan to leave to the level of output of 50,000 tons of production per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in Tyumen&apos; Oblast. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> In spite of the passage to another form of activity, the number of colleagues in enterprise was not reduced - now it is 157 people, in the plans with the purchase of new equipment - an increase in the personnel is even more than by 50 workers. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The retraining of personnel goes in enterprise, and the necessary specialists are selected from already existing. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Is next year planned to introduce the new aggregate of the length cutting of steel with thickness to five millimeters, which will make it possible to reduce the prime cost of production, and also one additional camp, with a speed of the production of pipe of up to 47 meters per minute. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> Toward the end of 2014 in enterprise they are going to master the production of the pipes, which are used in the housing and communal economy. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The management of enterprise poses the problem of shutting to 70 percent of the need of Tyumen&apos; Oblast for this production. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> The deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, turning to the leaders of productions, advised to pay larger attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Toward this are directed the forms of state support to industry, which include the compensation of the interest rates on the credits to the purchase of new equipment and expenditures on its leasing. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> In the present year for these purposes it is provided to allocate 150 million rubles, of this two thirds sums are already spent. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> The last commission, which will examine the agreements of subsidizing, assumes documents from the enterprises until November 15. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> In addition to this, by budget compensate the expenditures for the participation of local producers in the international fairs. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> For next year budget provided means in the size of 150 million rubles, which can be used for compensating for leasing payments and credits for the acquisition of new equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> 5 million will be isolated into the participation in the fairs, 3 million - to the programs of energy conservation. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> They are lowered to 72 million rubles in the means to the compensation of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of Tyumen&apos; Oblast for the natural gas complex. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> According to Leonid Ostroumova, over the long term this form of support will cease, since compensation for the tax to the extraction of minerals, which the oil companies paid out into the provincial budget, was the motive of its introduction. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> At present they this do not make and subsidy become the straight expense obligations of region. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> Taking into account this government of region priority considers direct support of industrial enterprises, but not financing through them petroleum branch. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> The aid of budget will be connected with the investment projects, which will begin to be realized in the production. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Many leaders of enterprises expressed concern in connection with the arising situation in the relations with the oil-industry workers. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Grant to equipment the bought by them is the competitory advantage of the industry of the south of Tyumen&apos; Oblast, and with its cancellation it will be difficult to compete on the price with the middle strip of Russia, where more cheap labor. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> Furthermore, is not clear a question with the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - company “Rosneft”, which thus far does not place its orders at the Tyumen&apos; enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Agreement on the realization of Uvatskogo project elapses in 2013, and claim its prolongation it did not enter. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> At present the enterprises of the south of the regions, which specialize in the equipment for the natural gas sector, cannot form order book for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> A question remains open, will enter taxes from oil into the budget of region obtained in the Uvatskiy region or they will be paid out on the place for the registration of the new owner of layers. </seg>

<seg id="2692"> Communication: the pre-election staff of Obama examined the exception of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2693"> According to the communication to The New York Times, the nearest advisers of the President of Barack Obama secretly examined the opportunity of replacing the Vice President of Joe Biden by the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the selective list of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> This discovery — the brightest sensation from by all the expected book of Mark Halperin and John Khaylemanna about the campaign of 2012 “rates are doubled: Game changed 2012”. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> The publication of The Times obtained the copy of the prepared for the output book and it reported on Thursday in the evening that the close aides the President conducted “scale studies in the focus-groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” in order to estimate, can the exception of Biden help to raise the fading hopes for the re-election of Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> According to the communication of the political reviewer of The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives the detailed description at of an attempt the high-ranking officials of the pre-election staff and White House, namely which was of the Head of Administration of the White House of Bill Daley, to estimate, what effect will show for the voting the designation of the former Secretary of State Clinton by Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Possible replacement was the secret, thoroughly guarded in the Chicago pre-election staff and in Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Only six nearest advisers of the President — including Daley, who was the head of the pre-election staff of Obama to Jim Messina and the former senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluffa — knew that the replacement is examined. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> The book “rates they are doubled” it asserts that Daley was the initiator of the attempt to replace Biden, in spite of them “close personal relations”, but in the final analysis it forewent this step, when their data showed that addition Clinton to the selective list not will &quot; improve substantially Obama&apos;s chances”. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> In the interview from Martin Daley it confirmed that the administration actually examined the opportunity of replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> “I actively spoke out for the examination of many things, and this was one of them”, said Daley to newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> You must remember that at that moment the President was in the terrible form, so that we thought: “About God, that to us to make?” </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Although Daley described a study as “necessary checking”, Martin described to the representative of CNN Anderson to Cooper that the pre-election staff sufficiently much put in the study of that, will bring this step dividends during the voting. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> “Pre-election staffs do not spend such amounts of money on the interrogations and focus-groups, if they do not examine something seriously”, said Martin in the program AK 360. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> It is unclear, however, Obama did know that his command studied the opportunity of replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> Martin described to CNN that he asked Daley, its then boss did know about the possible shuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Although Daley said that he does not think that the President “was up to date” possible replacement, that was Head of Administration it recognized that, “possibly”, Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Martin added that “the rates were doubled” it does not give clear answer to a question, did reach the results of political sounding Obama&apos;s table. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Cooper did ask Martin, seriously he considers that Obama did not know about a study of the opportunity to exclude Biden from the selective list. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> “Possibly”, answered Martin. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> The head of the control--disciplinary committee of the RFS [Russian Football Union] Arthur Grigoryants reported that “the Kuban” was penalized to 500,000 rubles, transmits from the house of football correspondent “SE” Philip PAPENKOV. </seg>

<seg id="2713"> At the session there were representatives of both clubs, man from the RFPL (Russian Soccer Premier-League). </seg>
<seg id="2714"> We investigated all available material. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> For the nepravometnoe behavior of spectators “Kuban” it is penalized to 500,000 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less than the beer </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The Russian brewers have poor mood. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> On their estimations, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the previous level, and this at best. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Although the businessmen originally relied on increase. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Indeed current year is added for them unsuccessfully: sales fell by 7 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> About everything this it told chapter of one of the most important brewery companies of the country, the Chairman of the Soviet of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps on III of the annual conference of the institute of Adam Smith “goods of daily demand in Russia”, which recently was completed in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> On it they discussed the government control of market. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> Since 2008 on 2012 the Russian market for beer has already been reduced by 18 percent, since in recent years in the country is observed the considerable strengthening of the regulation of the brewery branch in the part of production and revolution of beer - beverage with the small content of alcohol, it reported to the listeners of Sheps. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> There is not in one country of world such hard constraint of the market for beer, unpredictable introduction newer and newer illogical prohibitions, which are based allegedly by fight with the abuse of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> Brewer complained, that many legislative prohibitions, called to reduce abuse level of alcohol, do not have a special effect, nevertheless constantly appear all new initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Sicker than all the producers of beer struck prohibition introduced from this year to sell alcoholic in the kiosks. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> “We immediately lost 35,000 users”, said Isaac Sheps. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> For next year in brewers two forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Optimistic - that, about which spoke Sheps: sales of foam beverage will be preserved at the previous level. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Pessimistic - they will fall by 2-3 more percent. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> In order to preserve its they arrived, businessmen were forced to depart from the types, calculated for the mass user, to the class “premium”: beer it will become less, but it will cost more expensively. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Meanwhile radical consequences from a drop in sales with a small quantity of alcohol it is not thus far evident. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> “According to my observations, the level of the diseases by alcoholism remains approximately at the same level, reported doctor-narcologist Aleksey Sotnikov. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> True, grew the share of the sick, using substitutes strong beverages, and also those, who “took a seat” to the alcohol-containing toning up beverages like “the jaguar”, whereas ten years ago predominated precisely “beer” alcoholism. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> To what will lead the building TPU in Moscow </seg>
<seg id="2736"> With each year capital authorities promise to shape increasingly more transport-transfer units (TPU). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Until 2020. it is planned to introduce in build 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> How in reality turns around project, our correspondent was investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> The pair of months ago in the metro “Smolensk” of Arbat-Pokrovskoy line arose construction fence. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Inscription said, that goes the construction of transport-transfer unit. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> All this was very strangely, since no ground-based transport stops next to “the Smolensk” and cannot be, therefore, changed seats to it. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> In order to reach the nearest trolley-bus stoppage on the Sadovoye Kol&apos;tso [Moscow ringroad], it is necessary to overcome order 130 meters, including the ground-based passage through the Karmanitskiy alley. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> Now almost everything is finished in “Smolensk”. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Flower stall disappeared, stand for the newspapers was dismantled, and asphalt before the entrance was changed into block. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Here and entire transport unit. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Transport-transfer units are planar and capital, they explain in the press service of the capital department of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> There are no capital TPU as yet. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> But planar assume the building of parkings, conclusion of the commercial objects, which prevent the motion of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Strictly, by planar TPU even are occupied not transport workers, but professional benefactors from the department of the innovation repair of Moscow city. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Transport unit - this is not necessary complex construction, explains the director of the institute of the economy of transport and transport policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> It is sometimes sufficient roof overhead and signal panel, which notify about the time of the arrival of transport. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Here, for example, in the metro “they ashen &quot; recently opened completely valuable planar transfer unit. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Let without the sheds, but with intercepting parkings and signal panel, which indicate, when bus arrives. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> But in pursuit of a quantity officials write in TPU everything that not after falling. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Still in 2011 city hall planned to construct to everything about all 151 unit, of them 59 with the capital construction. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Now in the plans until 2020 are registered azh 255 TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> From them 150 promise to return even in this year. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Although in the city there is a development program TPU, not markedly any qualitative criteria, establishes Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of public organization “city and transport”. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> They report in a quantity of objects, but the quality of transplantation for each of them frequently deteriorates. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Criteria, in the opinion of the expert, must be two: first - the decrease of the time of transplantation, secondly - convenience. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> First of all the opportunity to replace the form of transport, without leaving under the rain. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> However, in Moscow with the construction TPU it sometimes leaves exactly vice versa. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> The clear example to the metro “of VDNKh (Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the USSR)”. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Earlier suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came into the square before the main entrance in VVTS. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Now their stoppages transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavki to the street of cosmonauts. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is further from the metro, it is considerably further from the monorail, then it is nearer to the apartment houses. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> For free that inhabitants did not completely want auto depot under the windows and complained into all possible instances. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Somehow immediately it did not assign with capital TPU in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> The first of them they began to build years five back in the metro “glider”. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Project was called to become model. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> And actually came out the model of that how the transfer unit, returned to the ransom to investors, it is converted into the commonplace shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> No, here is platforms for the buses, shed, in order not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of parking lots. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> True, to the Khimki trolley buses of №202 and №203 in Moscow TPU place they did not give principally. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Them as strangers they moved aside further from the metro. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> Then place under the trade greater it remained. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> One clothing alone of 32 stores, and generally exist almost all - from zootovarov to the auto-salon. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Well in fact, suddenly by whom from the passengers of bus it will be necessary to purchase in the road new machine? </seg>
<seg id="2778"> , When is built capital TPU, for some reason always is obtained shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Recently situation reached its logical completion, when they decided to return the part of the parking lot under the market. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Now on the third floor TPU “glider” among parkovochnykh places the marked on the gender goes brisk trade. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> Vegetables, spice, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, maliciously casting looks to our photographer. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Transfer unit finally became market. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> The fact is that earlier the metro “glider” had the market, but it they laid. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> But in the prefecture of merchants they were sorry and released to intercepting parking of transfer unit. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Nevertheless there it is always empty because of the high prices. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> However, ridiculous itself, that market they laid for this reason constructing at its place… for new planar TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> This here is castling. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> In the metro “Kaluga” the distance of approach from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> After the building of shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> In order to sit down into the bus, it is necessary to traverse entire shopping center. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> After 22 hours, when it is closed, it is necessary to go around it under the open sky. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> However, constructions in “the glider” and “Kaluga” will soon seem flowers. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> In the middle of September the city-planning-land commission of city hall affirmed the planning solutions for first eight capital TPU. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Four of them will be 25-storeyed, without considering two-three underground tiers. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> Main monster will grow in the metro “of Tushino”, in it there will be 418,700 sq. meters of area. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> The representatives of the board of the railroad train stations of RZhD (Russian Railways), corresponding for the building TPU in the metro, already described to the journalists: in the future high-rises will be arranged the stores, hotels and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In this case the officials assure, that multistage parkings will be engaged from third to half of area. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Let us take for an example “people” garages. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Let us say, the garage to 258 parking places, which they recently built on the international street, has the area of 8015 sq. meters. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> It means, for parking on 2,600 auto- in “the Petrovskiys-Razumovskoy” it will be required order 80,000 “of squares”. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> This is less than third from that bulky object, which there they are going to construct. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Let one-two floors go to any platforms for the buses. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Remain as the minimum 150,000 sq. meters of commercial real estate. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> But this, to minutochku, almost two GUMa. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> If capital TPU in stations and train stations build railroad workers, then remaining areas will master metropolitenovtsy. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> They also promised, that there will be many “objects of functional designation”, including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> By the way, in the department of property of Moscow city they recently told to journalists, that they work out the project of decision, according to which the investors can turn for obtaining of section for TPU to the officials directly. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Without any competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> Therefore, it is said, that transport questions for the city - priority. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> Ideal TPU - this, for example, “Harvard” station in Boston or “Spadayna” in Toronto, it is confident Alexander Morozov. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> There trolley buses and streetcars get down under the earth to the level of the metro and distance of approach from the railroad car of the metro to the streetcar it is only 50 meters without the output to the street. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Around no extra trade. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> But it throws Moscow officials into extremes. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Either nothing we will build or the already otgrokhaem of 25 floors with the offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Oil fell in the price to $96 per barrel. </seg>

<seg id="2865"> Company of Bombardier the located in Montreal also did not publish no data on the flight tests of its newest aircraft of CSeries and granted to new information about that, will be executed ambitious plans with respect to the introduction of aircraft into the commercial operation towards following September. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> After the first flight of the prototype of the air vessel, which was being taken place about one-and-a-half months ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about that, the stage of tests according to graph does go. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> Results did not justify forecasts and led to a drop in the actions more than on 8 percent on the Stock Market of Toronto. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Cameron Doerksen, the analyst of National Bank Financial, decreased on Thursday his estimation s “higher than srednerynochnogo” to “the srednerynochnogo” because of the persuasion, that an increase in the actions was limited into the near block or two. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> “Although reduction in the quantity of deliveries of airships was as a whole predicted, we are undoubtedly disappointed by the indices of the profit of transport division”, said Doerksen in the survey of the stock market. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> We believe that Bombardier will obtain new orders on CSeries in proportion to the continuation of flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Nevertheless, if in the next months it will not be declared about the new orders, we assume that the market will begin more skeptically to relate to the program. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> The company of Bombardier hopes that the family of the aircraft of CSeries will allow it to conquer place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now prevail. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The first prototype of air vessel was represented in March and it the first time completed flight in September after several months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> However, solid orders on CSeries there are thus far too many — 177, since the potential buyers wait flight-test results in order to verify the assertions of company about the fuel effectiveness and potential efficiency of new liner. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In all now are 403 orders and understandings with 15 clients and operators. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> Chief executive officer Pierre Boduan was confident, that Bombardier will achieve its goal into 300 solid orders up to the moment, when the first aircraft is neglected in the commercial operation. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> On Thursday leaders also certified analysts and media outlet, that the program advances according to the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> “Test model airplane did not remain on the earth longer than it was expected”, said Boduan during the phone conference, after adding that to the dead time of aircraft were planned the ground tests and software updates. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> All producers plan tests differently. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> We decided to conduct the first flight and to make interruption to the renovations, so we entered. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> So it will occur during the entire flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> The second of five test models must complete flight in the next weeks and everything else soon they will follow it, as company reported. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And nevertheless analysts skeptically relate to the statement, that the first client will be able to approach the operation of the aircraft of CSeries 12 months after his first flight. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The company of Bombardier stated that it evaluates the period of the putting into commission and will grant new information into next few months. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> “This slow rate of flight tests - although, in all likelihood, and corresponds to the internal graph of Bombardier - it supports our point of view, that the putting into commission will be postponed by the first quarter of 2015”, said Doerksen. </seg>
