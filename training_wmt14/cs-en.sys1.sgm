<seg id="247"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry - on luggage </seg>
<seg id="248"> Frontier Airlines plans in their years charge up to $100 for the imposition of hand luggage on board. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for a carry - on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep the soda. </seg>
<seg id="250"> The new fee for carry - on luggage concerns the luggage in the upper storage space, so that a small bag under the seat will remain free. </seg>
<seg id="251"> The company Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100, where passengers will be paying to wait until the arrival of the gate. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Frontier spokesman Kate O &apos;Malley, listen, stated that 100 fee is to encourage passengers to pay for care. </seg>
<seg id="253"> `` We chose this fee, &apos;&apos;she said. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Airlines began to charge the first and second brought bags in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Passengers tried to avoid those fees and stuffed into bags stashed in the storage space, as close as they could, so in this area often had not taken place. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Fees are one way to learn the passengers on board were less stuff. </seg>
<seg id="257"> O &apos;Malley, listen, said that the new charge is not really to get more money. </seg>
<seg id="258"> The point is that most loyal customers of Frontier is quite clear that finding a place at the top of the storage space is increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Passengers who bought tickets on the website of the company will not pay. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This means that one of the passengers in the queue at the gate of the Frontier can bring baggage to pay nothing, while the other passengers in the queue for the same bag will pay $100. </seg>
<seg id="261"> O &apos;Malley, listen, said that Web sites and check - in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers will learn about the fee before his arrival to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="262"> The new fee company Frontier for carry - on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer, but the date has not been set yet. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Passengers often on fees for baggage and other fees complain, but the airline is love. </seg>
<seg id="264"> Claims that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who want this service, would have to pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="265"> Many on Wall Street see additional fees for baggage as a sign that the airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="266"> But most of the fees for carry - on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="267"> The company Spirit Airlines as the first charge of hand luggage three years ago and other low cost airline Allegiant Air later followed her example. </seg>
<seg id="268"> The only company that has such charges, is the hungarian Wizz Air, says adviser in the field of air transport Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional fees. </seg>
<seg id="269"> In its report in December 2011 estimated that a fee for carry - on luggage company Spirit will bring in $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when he met with an unusual company Spirit fee for carry - on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="271"> `` Getting into the aircraft that was as smooth as I have ever seen in my career of air, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I was waiting at the gate to see the gnashing of teeth and argument. </seg>
<seg id="273"> The plane was full, he said, `` and going through in an instant. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="274"> Frontier also on the model of the company &apos;s Spirit apply charges for coffee, tea, soda and juice. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, may keep the soda and coffee will be free upgrades. </seg>
<seg id="276"> The water will continue to be free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="277"> US Airways in 2008 briefly tried to introduce charges for drinks, but after complaints from passengers about seven months later, no other major airline. </seg>
<seg id="278"> The last move of Frontier charge for carry - on luggage, passengers years if you purchase directly from the airline, is her last attempt to steer customers directly on their website. </seg>
<seg id="279"> Airlines are the online travel retailers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="280"> It could all airlines complaint that led passengers to purchase directly from them, the place to do it through online travel agencies. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The company, however, Frontier in this area have gone far. </seg>
<seg id="282"> In September started giving customers who bought over the internet travel agency, only half of miles in the frequent flyer program. </seg>
<seg id="283"> In the center of the Crop reward miles flown to 25 percent of the miles of the journey. </seg>
<seg id="284"> So the way companies Frontier long 1000 miles purchased over the Internet travel agency means reward 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The company also allows customers to select their seat in advance, only in the event that the purchase will directly through the company &apos;s Web site Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="286"> The company has the Frontier in your home town of Denver a loyal customer base, but its business is beginning to shrink and losing money. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The financial results mentioned in the center of the corporate partner of Republic Airways Holdings revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity in the first quarter decreased by nearly 13 percent </seg>
<seg id="288"> The company is selling the Republic this airlines trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="289"> We have studied 11 thousand ads! </seg>
<seg id="290"> We know where you want to work! </seg>
<seg id="291"> In November last year, the analysis caught over 11 thousand advertisements offering jobs, in the 4300 there was published in the daily newspaper ads and 6800 (62 percent) on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="292"> The Internet is becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers. </seg>
<seg id="293"> In 2005, when the survey conducted for the first time, the share of 26 percent. </seg>
<seg id="294"> In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) settled down to about 60 percent. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Advertising job opportunities in, according to the analysis of the largely reflects the current situation on the labour market. </seg>
<seg id="296"> An example would be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="297"> For example, in 2007, it was in the same reporting period published almost 25 900 ads in 2012 it was less than half. </seg>
<seg id="298"> The offer of jobs on the Internet is directed towards closer, notably more qualified group of professions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> By contrast, the job offer in the daily press covers a broad spectrum of professions, including those working - class, said the author Pauline Šťastnová analysis. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The intensity of the representation of the professional groups in both media is different. </seg>
<seg id="301"> On the Internet, took first place ads for managers and executives, the sales representative, programmers and financial experts. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The position of programmers or leading small business was only on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In the daily newspaper &apos;s share of these specialist professions significantly lower, conversely, a large representation belongs in the service and blue - collar professions. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Among the most commonly reported requirements that employers are expressed through advertising offerings include education, of course. </seg>
<seg id="305"> The reference was to other areas of knowledge of foreign languages, in English. </seg>
<seg id="306"> In the daily press was the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language included in the three percent of ads on the Internet in 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="307"> In only two percent of employers advertisements for active knowledge of two foreign languages. </seg>
<seg id="308"> Claims for &apos;computer literacy&apos; appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily newspaper in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent). </seg>
<seg id="309"> Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads. </seg>
<seg id="310"> Experience requirements are generally associated with qualified professionals. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In terms of production and other executives. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the working - class professions are mainly the mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or a plumber electrical equipment, said study author George Tillner. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Employers also in the middle of their ads state requirements for properties and skills of potential bidders. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Like most of the required skills in advertising in the first place already emerging communications skills. </seg>
<seg id="315"> The employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organizational capacity and reliability. </seg>
<seg id="316"> A fifth of shopping centres is struggling with low attendance </seg>
<seg id="317"> It is clear from the data real estate advisory company Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle. </seg>
<seg id="318"> In Prague Bohnice opens to the public the commercial centre of Krakow, 19 of the Prague shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="319"> In the Czech Republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 per cent of medium and large centres. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The main problems are inadequately large centre on the site and bad layout, too much floors or complicated and cumbersome arrangement passages, or dead space center, &apos;&apos;said Michael Soták from company Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Also, according to the head of the retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvia Samad, about one - fifth of the trade center struggling with low attendance. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Among the main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or overcapacity in the market place. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory. </seg>
<seg id="325"> In today &apos;s customers are conservative and want to change their shopping habits. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The new trade center must try harder to attract &apos;&apos; of their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events, &apos;&apos;said Samad. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Occupancy shopping centres is under Soták generally stable, even in some centres is rising, as landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of the rent and dopronajmout some units. </seg>
<seg id="328"> `` But it is true that recently opened some of the projects that are not fully occupied and so reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda &amp;amp; Weinstein in Opava Šantovka in Olomouc Soták), &apos;&apos;he added. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Commercial centres open in the past two years to promote market according to Sylvia Samad very slowly. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Place in the market for new projects but there is. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The number of places for the construction of a successful project is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="332"> For example, in Prague, we see scope for the construction of the project, which would serve the people of Prague 6. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Certainly there is room for the construction of the smaller local projects, the so - called &apos;convinience centres &apos;&apos;, focusing on purchases and services for the daily needs of the population living in the immediate area,&apos;&apos; said Samad. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Also under Soták exists on the domestic market place for another shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="335"> And as for the small &apos;handler&apos; center, so for large projects in Prague, or a medium - sized projects, or expansion in regional cities. </seg>
<seg id="336"> `` The city as Kladno, Ceske Budejovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth, &apos;&apos;added Soták. </seg>
<seg id="337"> In Prague sees scope for the upcoming Shopping Centre on winning the plaza, are also under him clear potential street in a ditch and Wenceslas Square. </seg>
<seg id="338"> `` Vigorously develop expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller and smaller towns in favorable rents and operating costs, space is also still in certain locations for smaller local or neighborhood shopping centers, or their reconstruction such as reconstruction commercial home Prior, who benefit from good locations, &apos;&apos;said Dita Kubánková from company DTZ. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In the Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centres, with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area. </seg>
<seg id="340"> A quarter of all the shopping center is located in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, stems from the company &apos;s data INCOM GfK. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The number of shopping parks in the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with the values of Britain and France is lagging behind the Czech Republic about 50 square meters per thousand people. </seg>

<seg id="366"> Report: Obama &apos;s campaign considered to replace Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="367"> The closest adviser to President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times secretly considered to replace on the ballot in 2012, Vice - President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="368"> This revelation is the most important story impatiently awaited book on the 2012 campaign from Mark Halperina and John Heilemanna `` double down: Game Change 2012. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="369"> The Times obtained a copy of the book, magazine and announced on Thursday night, the president of the co - workers were held at the end of 2011 intensive group meetings and surveys to predict whether a waiver of the Biden would help to revive the fading of Obama &apos;s hopes for re - election. </seg>
<seg id="370"> According to national political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record efforts leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, the former head of the White House Office of Bill Daleyho, measured the effect on the elections should move the former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The potential change was a closely - guarded secret in the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Only a few of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including Daleyho, former head of the Obama campaign, Jim Messina, a former top advisers in the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffeho - known to be considering this change. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The book `` double down &apos;&apos;, says that Daley was representative of the efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that by the time they finally decided not to implement this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would `` substantially increase the chances of Obama &apos;s.&apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="374"> In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="375"> `` I have studied all sorts of things, and this was one of them, &apos;&apos;said for Daley. </seg>
<seg id="376"> Do not forget that, at the time, he was president of the awful prospect, so we thought: `` Jesus, what are we going to do? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="377"> While Daley characterized the research as `` due diligence &apos;&apos;, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the campaign for re - election has made considerable investments, to determine whether this move in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="378"> `` During the campaign to interpret the kind of money on elections and qualitative research, if something is seriously considering, &apos;&apos;said Martin on AC 360. </seg>
<seg id="379"> It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team is considering this exchange. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Martin told CNN that Daleyho asked whether his then boss knew about this potential shuffling the cards. </seg>
<seg id="381"> While Daley said that he did not think the president `` was aware of potential changes &apos;&apos;, a former office manager admitted that it was `` possible&apos;&apos; that Obama knew about it. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Martin added that the book `` double down &apos;&apos;definitely does not answer the question of whether political probe got up to Obama on the table. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Martin Cooper asked whether he really thought that Obama did not know about the research on Biden &apos;s removal from the list. </seg>
<seg id="384"> `` Maybe, &apos;&apos;Martin said. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Not so, Mr Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="386"> We have a unique opportunity, as a message to politicians that, as no. </seg>
<seg id="387"> There is a need to develop such pressure to Martin Hašek has been cleared of all political posts and left the mandate. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Any other solution to reduce the level of political culture, which is already very slim. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Martin Hašek, zaštíťuje promise made, but everyone and especially policies must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what can promise. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Confidence is the only capital, which has policies (Mr Babiš has even the tangible, however, the question is whether the policies). </seg>
<seg id="391"> The best programme advocated a liar is untrustworthy. </seg>
<seg id="392"> In politics is no excuse, in politics is resigning. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Mr Hašek, if you are good with this country (and your frequent declarations in the fortified, if you did not lie to you - you can see how it is with lying to the complicated), leaving the policy itself, like a man. </seg>
<seg id="394"> People then take your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and was responsible for her own responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="395"> Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless wimp, whose words or actions can not be trusted. </seg>
<seg id="396"> Either you want to be proud, even though the errant man or a chicken. </seg>
<seg id="397"> Maybe you think it is unfair, when addressing only to you, but you are the leader and they just misguided sheep. </seg>
<seg id="398"> And the leader of you and you have always wanted to be. </seg>
<seg id="399"> I understand that is now trying to bend the ears, regroup, bear the disgrace and then strike again, but such is the way of the guerrillas or dishonest. </seg>
<seg id="400"> You are, I repeat, in their eyes, the leader of the alpha male, then so be it. </seg>
<seg id="401"> Accept responsibility and leave policy. </seg>
<seg id="402"> The black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="403"> While the american road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling motorway network, many are starting to see the solution in a little black box, which is easily fits into the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The device, which monitor every mile, who will miss the motorist, and transmit that information to authorities, are at the heart of the controversial efforts by Washington and offices for state planning to renovate outdated system of financing America &apos;s main roads. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Usually drab design motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Libertariáni met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for it, so that the government could use these little box, which would have recorded the distance travelled and maybe even where you go - and then use that information to the tax assessment. </seg>
<seg id="407"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="408"> The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply distressed and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy. </seg>
<seg id="409"> And while the Congress can not agree on whether to continue, some states to expect nothing. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Finding out how during the next decade may move to a system in which the driver applies per kilometre road, which runs. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Thousands of motorists already black boxes, some of which are using GPS tracking, to take the test. </seg>
<seg id="412"> This is a real need for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="413"> `` It is not a matter of where we can not be choosers, &apos;&apos;said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, the state plans to begin monitoring of mileage for each of the California motorists in 2025. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Changes to the way we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="415"> We need to use this technology. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The stimulus is the fact that the road the trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="417"> Americans do not buy enough gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="418"> Cars travel much more miles per gallon. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon for the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="420"> Because of the high price of petrol politicians are reluctant to raise a tax of one cent. </seg>
<seg id="421"> `` The tax on petrol just is not sustainable, &apos;&apos;said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy from the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars to test the system of paying for kilometre travelled. </seg>
<seg id="423"> `` In the long term, this seems like a logical alternative, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Experts called it a user fee in mileage. </seg>
<seg id="425"> It is no surprise that this idea like urban liberals, because the tax can be used to change behaviour patterns drivers which, for example, can help to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id="426"> California &apos;s designers look to this system in planning strategies designed to meet the targets set in the ambitious laws on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="427"> But Republican Representative Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee for Transport, said that it also sees a workable long - term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Leaders of the free market of the organisation of the Reason Foundation are also in favour of the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled. </seg>
<seg id="429"> `` It &apos;s not a tax, which will disappear into a black hole, &apos;&apos;said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organisation of Reason. </seg>
<seg id="430"> People pay directly for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The initiative also support the two former american transport ministers, who in 2011, urging Congress to set off in the direction of paying for half a mile. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The U. S. Senate last year approved a pilot project for USD 90 million, which should include about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="433"> The leadership of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and have done so for fear of rural legislators representing the people whose day - to - day life often means offend many miles out of town for work. </seg>
<seg id="434"> A few states and cities, however, is moving forward on their own. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Most ardent is Oregon, in the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers. </seg>
<seg id="436"> These drivers will soon start the state to pay tax on the distance travelled, instead of taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Nevada has already completed the pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="438"> New York just project examines. </seg>
<seg id="439"> Illinois tries it on to a limited extent in the trucks. </seg>
<seg id="440"> And a coalition of I - 95, which includes 17 state departments of transportation, along with the coastal states east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how to implement the change. </seg>
<seg id="441"> This concept is not, however, the only champion. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In Nevada, where it was recently device fitted with about 50 cars, the volunteers were drivers of concern that the government will be able to follow their every move. </seg>
<seg id="443"> `` Concerns regarding the monitoring of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem, &apos;&apos;said Alauddin Khan, who leads the management strategy and operations to the Nevada Department of Transportation. </seg>
<seg id="444"> It was not something people wanted. </seg>
<seg id="445"> As the project went on, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on their website warned: `` it would be very easy to turn this device to a full - fledged tracking device. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="446"> It is not necessary to build a ponderous technological infrastructure, which inevitably spread to the day - to - day trips and the arrival of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to monitor how many miles of driving the car, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="448"> If you can, said Khan, the public will be calmer. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to small companies in California with the name of the True Mileage (the actual distance). </seg>
<seg id="450"> The company originally into action to help the government in taxation of drivers. </seg>
<seg id="451"> I wanted to break through in the emerging market with insurance liability, where drivers would not be paid on the basis of how many will take off. </seg>
<seg id="452"> But this device, which tested, drawing the attention of the planners of the road network, because using GPS and adds only a limited amount of information, which are regularly recorded the modem. </seg>
<seg id="453"> `` People will be more willing to go, if taken their speed and their location, &apos;&apos;says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="454"> In some of these pilot programmes, a series of major errors. </seg>
<seg id="455"> They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In Oregon, designers are experimenting with the drivers to make a choice. </seg>
<seg id="457"> They may choose the GPS device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Or you do not need to take any of the device and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all people in the state. </seg>
<seg id="459"> In other places, hoping to alert the public to the concept, if the device will be able to more, not less. </seg>
<seg id="460"> In the city of New York transport officials trying to develop the device, which would be equipped to moreover, it was possible to pay fees for parking meters, to provide insurance under the mileage and gathering data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic. </seg>
<seg id="461"> `` Motorists will be willing to go along with it because of the value of the benefits offered to them, &apos;&apos;says the design document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Some traffic planners, however, would like to know whether any discussion about paying for a mile is not just a huge problem. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area, they say that Congress might problem is bankrupt road Trust Fund very easily solved by increasing taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="464"> One - off or annual tax could be levied on the driver &apos;s hybrid or other cars that consumed much fuel, so they will pay their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="465"> `` There is no need for radical surgery if enough to take aspirin, &apos;&apos;said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for the legislation and public affairs. </seg>
<seg id="466"> If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about their privacy, and a lot of other things. </seg>

<seg id="468"> Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the operator O 2. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Both companies confirmed the negotiations and, according to various sources of agencies and from behind the scenes, he said he had a hand in his sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Notification of the transaction should come up in November, probably before the start of the auction frequencies for LTE network, thus before 11 November. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Kellnerův competitor Karel Komarek KKCG own group. </seg>
<seg id="472"> It is under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications to auction the spectrum for LTE network. </seg>
<seg id="473"> And to everyone &apos;s surprise, in the meantime, the taste of the company into the telecommunications was discussed. </seg>
<seg id="474"> But Sazka right now is a very experienced telecommunications Veteran Robert Chvátal. </seg>
<seg id="475"> It began as a marketing chief MOBILE today (T - Mobile), eventually becoming director of the Slovak T - Mobile and the last time was in charge of the austrian branch of the same operator. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Sazka plays several cards at once. </seg>
<seg id="477"> Enlisted in the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for Vodafone virtuála. </seg>
<seg id="478"> And it makes sense. </seg>
<seg id="479"> If he succeeds in the auction, to their networks will be able to move the existing customers from its virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="480"> It would normally like Vodafone, but according to the information economic newspaper that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Vodafone currently suffers from the competitive operators O 2 and T - Mobile, who will be completely share their networks. </seg>
<seg id="482"> Vodafone and needs a partner. </seg>
<seg id="483"> And that may be just in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="484"> If it succeeds in the tender for the LTE network (as a freshman can auction the specially designed spectrum) and Vodafone in the auction is not necessarily, or he will not mind auctioning only limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all). </seg>
<seg id="485"> Vodafone is the Sazka may share on the network. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Vodafone released Sazka into his 2 G / 3 G network (or newly built a network of LTE frequency at 900 MHz), which will allow the firm to Fast Start network. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Sazka between starts to build costly LTE network, which will be able to use and Vodafone. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Not satisfied may be both companies. </seg>
<seg id="489"> The money saved would then Vodafone could spend as a provider of fixed Internet or cable television. </seg>
<seg id="490"> And Kellner? </seg>
<seg id="491"> That would buy the Czech and Slovak O 2 (Slovak Branch is the daughter of the Czech has immediately featured operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services. </seg>
<seg id="492"> But on the other hand, it &apos;s a big juggernaut, which will wait for the restructuring. </seg>
<seg id="493"> In the auction would gain LTE network Kellner, O 2 and very likely in conjunction with T - Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Both companies have declared that the network will share. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The auction could finally end a success, but probably not enough to high amounts to the state budget. </seg>
<seg id="496"> And from next year as customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calls with Vodafone, T - Mobile, Kellner or Komarek. </seg>

<seg id="597"> According to the World Health Organisation in Cameroon is only one doctor at 5, 000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="598"> For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor at 413 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="599"> And even if the doctor Cameroonians could visit, many would could not afford it. </seg>

<seg id="605"> He became a doctor cardiovascular surgeon in Central Hospital in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="606"> And he founded the non - profit organization whose members ASCOVIME weekend visits to rural areas, where they provide medical care for free. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Since 2008, with his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Almost every Friday and up to 30 people to pack the supply, affixed to the roof of the medical needs of rough terrain and travel to villages, they need help. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Not always accompanies them luck. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Once the vehicle must push through the river and mud. </seg>
<seg id="611"> But when they arrive, they will get a welcome as the real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation which community can offer. </seg>
<seg id="612"> In these villages is free medical care is really the reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with a broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willingly participates in local hilarity. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The next day the team starts to treat hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="614"> `` On every trip we have 500 patients, &apos;&apos;says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="615"> They come to the village of 60 miles, and it on foot. </seg>

<seg id="624"> On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired, but proud of his work. </seg>
<seg id="625"> This group - consisting of Cameroon &apos;s foreign doctors and medical students - carried out last year 700 operations free of charge and realizing that their aid for local residents can mean a lot. </seg>
<seg id="626"> One man said that after a hernia operation will be able to work again. </seg>
<seg id="627"> `` It will change the future of our family, &apos;&apos;the man said. </seg>

<seg id="637"> `` This is undoubtedly a hero, &apos;&apos;says O &apos;Malley, listen. </seg>
<seg id="638"> This organisation makes his life and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless. </seg>

<seg id="1052"> Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of the seats, the stakes are large contracts </seg>
<seg id="1053"> Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft burst into a dispute about the width of the seats in the second grade for flights on long distance, which this month gave a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The subject of dispute is the width of the seats granted on long - haul flights in economy class - not just the one would normally airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to claims for efficiency in the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Airbus this week called for industry standards, which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but America &apos;s main rival Boeing says you have to decide the airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1056"> The dispute arose when the aircraft manufacturers to compete in the sale of the largest two - engined version of its long - range aircraft with potential a record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> How is the back of the aircraft disintegrated - particularly whether it next to the 9 or 10 seats - is the foundation of the economic performance of claims on proposals for new aircraft `` mini - jumbo &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> The company says that Boeing 777 improved model `` X &apos;&apos;delivers 406 people in economic seats with more than 43 cm spread across 10 in a row. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> Airbus says that the competing version of its A 350 delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out at 9. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> The giant aircraft are often attacked each other in the technical issues through advertisements in the professional media. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> Airbus now before the Air Show in Dubai, where he expects the 777 X takes advantage with more than 100 orders, calls directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Provisionally recently pointed out what may be the start of a new advertising war, when financiers pointed picture depicting three people in a crowded restaurant with the headline `` let you like it? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1063"> `` Boeing promotes long - haul flights in seats closer than they are in the regional turbo - prop aircraft, &apos;&apos;said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> How to change the eating návky, people are more, but the seats on planes are radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Since the beginning of the 1970 s, when a Boeing 747 Jumbo defined the modern long - haul air travel, at the turn of the century, according to data from the Ministry of Health, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> According to US health statistics, the average American in the 21 st century over 100 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> Airbus says that his rival is the concept of seats from 50 years ago, when the average width of seating newly baptized aircraft was lower. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> Airbus says that has carried out research which suggests that the extension of the seats on the 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep about 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> Boeing Airbus rejects the dimensions of the seats, and says that it is not in the power of the aircraft manufacturers decide how the airlines offsets the fees and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on matters more than just the width of the seat. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> `` It really is about to give airlines flexibility and enable them to do things they believe it has to do to be successful, &apos;&apos;said an expert in the area of Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> They do not want to dictate what brings them profit. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> For passengers is essential more space for his elbows, but for the supplier is a growing problem that may affect yields. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> In this dispute is a race in aircraft orders, with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion at catalogue prices, enough to tip the balance of the american and european exports. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> As stated in July, Reuters, the distribution of seats is what drives the battle between the last aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> Both Airbus and Boeing argues that, in their recent proposals for long - haul twin - engined aircraft to 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment, the model of the Boeing 777 - 300 ER with 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Performance claims Boeing depends in part on the design of the 777 X model compared with 10 seats in the series, and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Revenue in the unit cost is compared to 10 sedadlovému concept weakened. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> `` The reason that Boeing does is so loaded up with more seats, and made their aircraft more competitive compared to our products, &apos;&apos;said Kevin Keniston, leading to the comfort of the passengers on the Airbus for Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> On the other hand, analysts say that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with that many passengers is denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> `` Forty - five inches wide seat for passengers would be great, but the reality is that, from a business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of 777 model, &apos;&apos;said an expert on cabin interior Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Airbus and Boeing supply seats, but offer airlines to catalogue the suppliers that can choose. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> He travelled sellers aircraft even carries the band to check the competitive arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> While wearing the comfort, all manufacturers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low - cost airlines and regional travelers. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> The Airbus A 350 offers a model with 10 seats in the series, but says that it still sold. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Until recently, the Airbus emphasised the need for greater adjustments to the cabin, so that it offered in some of its aircraft wider seats in the aisles. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> Experts say that without the support of a further large modern aircraft manufacturer &apos;s call for a new industry standards remain unanswered, but may deter waves from the sale of the 777 X. </seg>

<seg id="1116"> George Kerevan: divided Europe gives scots choice </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Another day, another ghost story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> This time he appears, warning that the condition for membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be his entry into Schengen. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> It gave to stories on passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian &apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde to possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected - that the headline in the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> No one mentioned that the EU Member States spends a lot of time to adjust their own laws, if it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Whereas Scotland now in Schengen, offer continued non - compliance would be for Brussels cheap concession in return for anything from scots really want. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> So it &apos;s quite a story. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> And so old that it would become a relic. canard that `` independence means passport control, &apos;&apos;I heard from at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Yet in this tale of bearded one interesting idea. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Why they should expect that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> Why change the yoke of London for the Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1128"> This is the real story: a great post - war plan to unite Europe finally collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> The effect of the crisis of the euro is the so - called project Europe is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Across Europe, the influence of the sacred to the opposition to the EU or the euro as a common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Even in Germany eurosceptic party alternative for Germany - based this year - came out of nowhere and federal elections in September had taken nearly five million votes, which from the Bundestag essentially `` sweep &apos;&apos;of the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats). </seg>
<seg id="1132"> At home he was always the opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The current economic crisis, but became a decisive moment. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a straitjacket on the national economy by adhering to the common currency has led many to believe that Europe had gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> The euro crisis has little to do with the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> Rather, it is a system of the euro, which blocks of its members on exchange rates advantageous for german exporters - and german politicians want to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency to southern Europe in the area of domestic production compared to Germany &apos;s disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> The only help is to cut public expenditure and revenue - which encourages Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> For the current problems with the budget and currency is the deeper cause of the languid performance. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> As a result of the `` green &apos;&apos;energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the french and german companies at the expense of consumers - the european industry twice more for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it is in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost, as we saw in the case of Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Not all the freezing salaries in the world would reverse zadupání the petrochemical industry slate of cheap oil from the US. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> The result is a simmering rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporters of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany will not rein in Paris and allow to stand in the world on a level of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> Berlin but now Paris as a badge of political legitimacy and asserted in Europe does not need its own economic policy and battered the french economy to fend for itself. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> The result: the right wing Marine Le Pen, anti - european National Front just won substantial additional options and relegated the ruling Socialists in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> The queue is now with 24% of the votes, the most popular party in France - early warning for UK Labour that can not infer that fission right is automatically reflected positively on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> As Le Pen deals with its newfound popularity among the white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1149"> The european elections next year would like to use to across the European Parliament has created the anti - european bloc against the common currency. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> If the anti - european parties will result in these elections, which is likely, may be a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament to dominate. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> `` I think that, for the foreseeable future, the growing anti - european feeling and attitude against the common currency and the euro will die. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> The EU will not disappear, but it turns into something more rigorous in terms of `` Europe &apos;s sovereign nations &apos;&apos;), has preferred to General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Germany and several of its satellite economies might leave the euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I expect that the United Kingdom from this project will distance himself and moves to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But the increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And where will it be Scotland? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> We can choose to be areas (in principle) small England. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Or we can defend their own economic interests - it is also a possibility to Berlin and Brussels, where we have to be. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> I suppose that Scotland would have resulted in a relaxed arranging a Europe well, provided that it has retained its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> Cooperation with other like - minded countries would be easier in a federal Europe of nations. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Otherwise, we should take a cue from Norway and to keep their economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> The SNP government in Scotland is - bizarrely - the most successful political movement promoting austerity measures in Europe, which won a huge majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition &apos;s position against the cuts planned (and implement) Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> It would be ridiculous, if Scotland voted for independence, just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> The parents of intersex children may choose the vague `` sex &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Germany became the first european nation, which recognises the third sex in children born with ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> The new - born children are ranked only to either male or female gender. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The new law from parents required to provide for such children of either gender, and allows them to their birth sheets indicate sex as a `` vague &apos;&apos;or `` unspecified&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> The law is to stop pushing for parents to be in your child &apos;s hastily opted for surgery to determine the sex, and the fight against those who are of intersex. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> One of intersex person, according to the BBC, after many years, said: `` I am neither man nor woman. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1170"> I will stay patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It is estimated that every year from 2000 children born one, nor is it a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> They are of intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts, which belong to the diagnosis of disorders of the sexual development, an umbrella term for those who are atypical chromosomes, gonads (testicles or ovaries) or unusually developed his genitals. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Of intersex could be Wallis Simpson. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most of the experts in the United States says that if you can not determine the sex, it &apos;s better to use the best available information and to identify them, instead of waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until they carried out the operation, if at all. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in identifying problems with sex, said that the new german law `` looks like a good thing. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Of intersex children are an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> `` Some people are in a life - threatening condition that requires surgery, but in most of the children it is not so, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Determining sex can be made without the operation and then they can wait, as to the identity of the evolving. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> Knowledge of how the child will develop gender is not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> No one can answer the question of why this is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> It &apos;s a mystery why some people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 of intersex person described as different from transgenderových or transgender people, because of their status is not bound by gender, but on their biological structure that is not solely neither male nor female, but typically consists of both, and it can not be clearly defined as not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> These features can occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair, breasts, and the figure in the primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of the chromosome and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by of intersex and transgender people in the field of work, and also the level of harassment, violence and prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The boys - no sex now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Australia and Nepal already allow adults described in official documents, male, female or `` third sex &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Norrie May - Welby, 52 - year - old Australian, in June for the first globally recognised `` sexless &apos;&apos;person when he won the appeal to for the rest of his life to keep the status of `` uncertain&apos;&apos; sex. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> According to the Ministry of Interior will have german passports in addition m (man) and F (woman) and the third, X, and that of intersex person. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> In neighboring France, according to intelligence reports on France 24 issue of sex is still controversial. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> In 2011, dozens of french legislators in this heavily catholic countries signed a petition calling for it to have been removed from school textbooks `` theories about sex. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1191"> American website Catholic Online against german law also define and wrote: `` with the way the world is dragged to the new situation, where sex is a matter of choice, but not of sexual activity, we twist inside out two other pillars of civilization. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1192"> One mother of a newborn from Maryland also said for Baby zone that would rather see that children have allocated sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> `` Parenthood itself is stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child, &apos;&apos;said for Web pages on parental care. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Historically, the children with both male and female sex called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome, who had dual gender. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> And about ten years the medical community believed that sex is something like a table, which can delete and repaint again. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> But now many are questioning the ethical basis of operations that gender is a complex issue and doctors can sometimes decide incorrectly, because they do not know how because of their gender children can feel when they grow up. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> `` In the middle of the 20 th century, it was called psychiatric emergency services, &apos;&apos;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> When these children born to call you a psychiatrist, but a surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> Persistent theories about how to treat children with ambiguous gender, was presented to Dr John Moneyem at Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is manageable. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> He created a new concept of `` sex &apos;&apos;and argued that the causes of social and environmental influences - as parents raised their child - were on a child &apos;s genes and hormones and shape the child, regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> But in one case of 1966, known as the `` John / Joan &apos;&apos;, his theory has become a contentious. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged by poorly made circumcision, recommended that their child had a vasectomy, even removed his testicles and raised him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> `` The media has presented the case as a successful transformation of the case, but the reality was different, &apos;&apos;said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> When the boy was 15 years old, he gave back to the boy and married to a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 38 years, however, committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Drescher said that some doctors `` this model used today. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1208"> But in the 1990 s, with the advent of the Internet, the surviving these operations have discovered `` dissatisfied with the outcome &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> This was the case even Bruce, 36 - year - old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but the ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Doctors were not sure whether it has a large clitoris, or a small penis, and we believe that, as a man could never live `` a life &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> And so shortly after his birth in 1976 Bruce surgically removed external bodies and testicles, and was brought up as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> In 12 years, the female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> `` I knew that I was not a girl, &apos;&apos;he said on ABCNews. com. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask that. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> At 18 he was sent to the plastic sheath. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> But because he was depressed and I knew that something was wrong, he asked for medical records. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> What he found was startling. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the birth, I was sterilised and no one has ever said anything. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> Bruce was born with the disorder of sex (DSD), which said the body to produce sufficient amounts of testosterone to properly develop his genitals. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> After what he had learned the truth, turned back to the man took the dose of testosterone and remove the breasts; </seg>

<seg id="1225"> We fear that it says for intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> We believe that it is better to allocate a male or female gender, and then wait. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But we do not know how the law will eventually lead, so all we can do is speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Tamar - Mattisová said that her organization supports australian law, because `` it allows adults choose to be included in the third sex. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1229"> `` An adult should be able to make their own decisions on legally force of sex, &apos;&apos;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> German law is going to assign him at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> This is a battle in this time of a small child to seduce. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> When they grow up, they can on their own to make their own decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> But Dr Arlene Baratzová, radioložka chest from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the german law `` granted powers &apos;&apos;as parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Baratzové daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has called on androgen insensitivity syndrome DSD. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Because her androgen receptors are defective, developed by Katie &apos;s features. </seg>

<seg id="1239"> `` The law gives parents some space to his decision to take their time, &apos;&apos;said Baratzová. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It gives them time to carry out certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write `` the man &apos;&apos;or `` woman&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In this respect, it is all right - you are raising your child and you love it. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> You have a wonderful child and celebrating. </seg>

<seg id="1377"> Without undue hype, threats and million statement sent aircraft, you hit the target and returned. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Without leaving lulled by the official disposal of chemical weapons in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The whole event refuse to confirm and had to do. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The exact opposite of confused and mall, unsupported by Obama &apos;s syrian policy. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> And most satisfying to its attack was what the Israelis bombed. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Do not be fooled by the media of their assertions that was bombed syrian `` base &apos;&apos;or `` deliveries for Hizbaláh&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> Recently, I wrote here that, while the US aid secular rebels in the country remains a rhetorical plane, so Russia blithely supplied weapons to Syria. </seg>

<seg id="1385"> The clear message. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> And note, Israel again bombed Assad &apos;s regime, not the rebels, though that according to popular web theory should be the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The US government with 2 members spaciálních units, possibly Delta Force. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> He did not know until now that had distinguished themselves during the attack on the american consulate in Benghazi. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It is not a heroic death two former member of the SEALS, who defended the CIA in the city, to me it was a secret CIA members of the squad, which is made up of former soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> For a long time there was speculation about the SEALS in the consulate or even located elsewhere in the mansion of the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> It is now clearer. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In any case, the information that the CIA has in Libya, his office protected machine gun nests (it was at one of these two members of the SEALS were killed by a mortar round), is quite surprising. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> They were part of the american commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as we got a report on the attack in Benghazi voluntarily come forward to intervene and together with five private contractor shot their way into the CIA in Benghazi. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The Obama administration bungled the fact that, during the attack was not the same squad deployed officially and all, and that is simply hesitant about what to do. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The squad leader, so no orders to release these volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> Anyway, that in the country is not a one - off, but the american commandos, the CIA agents and private contractor is quite an interesting information. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Given that, until recently, not officially acknowledged that, even now, just talking about a consultancy the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> But it is good that the US even when half - heartedly trying to fight terrorism in Libya. </seg>

<seg id="1402"> Not so long ago, the media almost sung the iranian air force for the prosecution of american drones. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Few, however, it is not known how the Americans their drones effectively protects. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Of course, if you can find the drone in its airspace, there is nothing to do with it. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> However, if the Iranians drone was discovered in the area of the international situation is completely different. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> And so it was that the iranian aircraft F - 4 Phantom pursued the american drone in international airspace over the sea, which was perhaps the first american a Super F - 22 Raptor in history. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The hull Phantoma to visually verify its equipment, without him Phantom registered on the radar or just noticed and then suddenly appeared at him and called on the iranian pilot to return home, the unquestioningly obeyed. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> No wonder, when the Phantom is an american manufacturing, but who remembers the war in Vietnam. </seg>

<seg id="1411"> A federal appeals court on Thursday to block the court order demanding changes in the stop and search people at the police department in New York and the judge in the case. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> The US Federal Court of Appeal said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on the appeal, which the city was lodged. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> Judge in August, decided that the city had violated the constitution that has carried out its programme of stopping and questioning people. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The city of its conclusions and its corrective regulation, including the decision to allocate supervision, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training programme. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> The appeal court heard arguments on Tuesday for the postponement. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The appeals court said that a judge must be to withdraw from the case because it is in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that a judge acted as a requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statement, which openly responded to the criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> The judge decided that the police officers of violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, when it was wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics in the context of its programme to stop and search people. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Establish an independent supervision, to oversee the reforms, including changes in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the pilot programme for the purpose of testing camera worn on the body in some areas where there is often stopping people. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In August, the city of New York approved the methods of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The justification for the appeal of the city is scheduled for sometime after 14 March 2014. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> The tactic of stopping and searching people have criticised a number of defenders of civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> There is some form of stopping and frisking people for about a decade, but reported searches under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg &apos;s dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases for blacks and Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> In 2004, wrote the four men, who all belong among minorities, the action, which became a case of collective actions. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Supporters of the changes the stopping and searching people conducted by the police department in New York, argues that the changes to end the unfair practices, will increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and may affect how these procedures used by other police departments. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but no crime, and that the money will be wasted, but will not solve the broader problem when the police force under pressure after over the last decade have reduced its numbers of several thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Judge said that put an end to the practice of stopping and searching people, which is a constitutional reform, but the way in which the examinations of the police department in NY introduced. </seg>

<seg id="1451"> Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered in the same name and date of birth, but I used the invented e - mail and telephone number and wonder of wonders, appeared to me that the page on my e - mail sent a link to complete the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> But how can this be possible when they can not be registered in the same name and date of birth? </seg>
<seg id="1453"> I think because it binds Tipsport Holder to e - mail and telephone number and date just knock as he claims. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So again, I told this to technical support that simply lie (either intentionally or do not know and what they write), because what you write is not true. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> I support of several screens that the problem with the registration was before 31 October so `` false &apos;&apos;registration for this simply is not affected. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> To me that Tipsport wrote off stiff sentence - I am sorry, but that you have already registered again, we can not check your statement. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> And communication. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> And repeated the same thing over and over again, that the registration of a name and date of birth. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> They can not accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e - mail, and so they do not run. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> If it is, not only Tipsport that erased the data as it claims, but still lying when he said the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> The worse is that it can be easy to prove how they lie and trying to make it look like he is the error on the part of the customer. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> By the way, after placing this matter on my personal blog things into a bit of movement and technical support came from the e - mail that the matter be transmitted to review and will be informed (after a week of urgency and haggling and warnings on the same mistake). </seg>

<seg id="1468"> Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, asserted that he believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and the idea of what is the true extent of the killing. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> `` It is easy to say that I had everything I know, understand everything and then intervene and correct the situation, &apos;&apos;he said on Thursday, Khieu Samphan before the court. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Do you really think that I wanted this to happen to my own people? </seg>
<seg id="1471"> The fact is that I did not have any power, &apos;&apos;he added. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Nuon Chea said that never ordered cadres of the Khmer Rouge, `` with people mistreated or kill them, denied food or committing genocide. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1473"> But he admitted the `` moral responsibility &apos;&apos;for the dead. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> `` I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the cambodian people, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>

<seg id="1483"> Fantastic ice cream to glow in the dark? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> The british businessman made the first ice cream to glow in the dark - using a jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the marine animal, and developed a luminous delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The idea came when he read the professional treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded the scientists in China to chemically produced a protein that causes the phosphorescence. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> This ice cream reacts with the language of the eater - increases the ph of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore, the more lick, the more September. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> Charlie, the founder of an ice cream company `` Lick me I am delicious &apos;&apos;(licked me taste great), says: `` it &apos;s an amazing stuff, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so for £200 you get about 2 g of this substance.&apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Protein that we use in the ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral ph. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> So how does your mouth protein warms up, increasing the ph and ice cream begins to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> We tested it over the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea for a Halloween, because the causes of this fantastic brilliant effect. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream, I have ever made, because the glow of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> And so every hillock costs about £140. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> But it tastes good. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Charlie &apos;s experimental company based in Bristol, is known for its traditional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> His other product is to be but even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> He says: `` I really wish I make an invisible ice cream. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1499"> In essence, it &apos;s impossible because of the effects of light caused by ice crystals, which consists of ice cream, but I reckon that with some way to do it, we will. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Ice cream using fluorescent jellyfish properties, artificially produced by chinese scientists. </seg>

<seg id="1514"> Cooperation with the team of Organization of the Olympics in Sochi 2014 according to Dr. Martin is a little more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> On what was on the last Olympics, we can not forget. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> `` Nothing works as well, &apos;&apos;says the boss of the Czech Olympic mission. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> What, exactly, is it? </seg>
<seg id="1518"> Many things are going more slowly and not exactly. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> It &apos;s a confusing. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> From the point of view of the invoices are relatively fast, from the point of view of supplying information about material things not so much. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> They might have three months to pry delivered to us, as will be officially marked the village, so that we could do a whole range of things. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> We are still waiting, and they still say that the thing they communicate. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> In a number of things still communicate. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> It is now at least finished the Olympic village? </seg>
<seg id="1525"> But it &apos;s not catastrophic situation. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> A month ago, we were at the empty rooms. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Fortunately, the house is worth. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> What does that are empty? </seg>
<seg id="1529"> They are to be finished the floor? </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The concrete, such was the month before. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> But they still have time. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Even if there is a danger that, until 26 January as a vanguard arrive, there will still feel the glue. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> And if we were not, so what? </seg>
<seg id="1534"> President Putin would mean giving the army? </seg>
<seg id="1535"> So it probably will. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Only it was not that the Olympic village = potěmkinovy village. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Rather, there is a risk that they will not make such adjustment disorders, finish the details. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Maybe they will have the way in this state, that we are going to have to take the boots of the London Games. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> But I believe that somehow it together. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> How many of the czech sports people could go to Sochi? </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Now there is roughly 78, although depending on the nomination criteria that number changes. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Maybe skaters probably would be at the Trinity, what was left. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> About rychlobruslařce Martina SÁBLÍKOVÁ also need no doubt, but otherwise it is in development. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Still awaits you trip to Sochi? </seg>
<seg id="1545"> No, if nothing happens, I should go there to 26 January. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> How will look like houses in the Olympic village, we know. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Even some of the things we have ourselves to plumb the subway to not only drawing. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> We are also a number of other things, including transport. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> And what does the boss of a hundred days before the Olympic Games? </seg>
<seg id="1550"> I am preparing to the annual evaluation of the Olympic sports, plus I am doing routine agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Sochi. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Instead of the post - election beef stew post - election </seg>
<seg id="1552"> October elections rather than the winner has brought a bunch of losers. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> It is not only the parties to the House of Commons or not (e. g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09), and eventually the Democrats because of its internal dissension. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Politicians will place a sirloin served on the weekend of the post - election stew. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Springer elections became the movement of Andrei Babiše voters, which promised to change the political style of government. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The fragmentation of the election result and dissension in the winning side plays into the political (of) the will of the president Milos Zeman regardless of the wishes of voters who side, which President Zeman publicly supported, not elected to the House of Commons. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> President: because of the unpleasant events lost strategic ahead of other policies, but there are still a number of ways to get it back - for example, the future prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> While the Democrats&apos; chances of obtaining the Prime Ministership in my eyes away, the trader Andrew Babišovi instead approaching. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The post - election development is not yet miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government, but compared with the pre - election scenario of a left - wing government Democrats supported the Communists, this is for the development of business in the Czech Republic, and thus the economy not only better news. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Due to the loud opposition will get together with the CDP or TOP 09, is still the most likely scenario coalition of Democrats, yes, and the CDU - CPP (a total of 111 MPS). </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Given the schism in the Democrats, which has thus become unreadable and a pit in the negotiations, may be the result of coalition negotiations rather depressing for Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> The minority government Democrats lodged with `` nezemanovců &apos;&apos;at the castle probably get away with it. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> In addition, any government that Democrats will participate, will be jeopardised unmet ambition of many of the Social Democrats, which may lead to further sooner or later a schism in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> So, I ask myself: `` `` unassisted back to another early elections? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Another option would have been rather a referendum on the strength of the voters&apos; mandate movement, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Plans for the Democrats on the sector, raising taxes, higher taxes on income or the building of the State Bank fell hopefully under the table. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The Democrats, yes, the CDU - CPP and Dawn, on the other hand, for example, agree to promote entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP) to promote employment disadvantaged people, a reduction of the lower VAT rate on selected goods. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Friction is the most experienced in perspective on social policy and the size of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> It has now but on top of that, so the program so far, most likely coalition yes, Democrats, the CDU - CPP, leaning more to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Which, in my view, is a better result than left - wing agenda with taxes on everything in the economy was still moving. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> More recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> As the reasons have been given corruption, wasting money on extravagant purchases and government procurement, raising taxes and government scandals. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> According to the results of the elections may conclude that the majority of the citizens of this state. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> It really did not matter, and the state who was here (theft and debt that State), were not satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Otherwise I can not explain that 3 413 497 voters came to elections, 596 357 voters elected TOP 09 384 174 ODS voters voted for a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original ruling coalition, which represents 52,16% of all legitimate voters. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Which is an absolute majority. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> When the parties count 1, 016 829 voters Democrats, then with the old order (because of all the parties involved in the `` theft &apos;&apos;and the debt that State), then this situation actually agreed 64,23% of legitimate voters. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> This, in fact, the majority of voters made it clear that they are not to punish the guilty rozkradení and over - indebtedness of this state. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Or do you think that members of the Democrats, who are involved in this work for the appropriate laws? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> We did not help? </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Olomouc opens in the historic center of public rink </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel burned, said that preliminary work on the rink started 26 October and from Wednesday &apos;s operation in aggregate production on the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> The ice layer is already strong seven inches and into Friday morning area will be ready for the first visitors. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> The rink to 375 square feet, took the podium 358 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Skaters and passers - by will be also available two stalls and punch. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> `` We expanded floor area, boosted the area in front of the stands and almost the entire area is roofed podium to skaters could easily not change, &apos;&apos;described the charred. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> The streets of Olomouc already like Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Last year it was the rink for a revision of the Lower Square installed directly in front of the main entrance hall at the top of the square. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Correction to the square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice could go back to his original position. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> For the first time, people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Ice will then become an integral part of Christmas markets in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Christmas markets, which is part of the rich cultural program, will be at the top of the square began the month before Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Scientists more light, as the movements of the tail is linked with the mood of the dog &apos; </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Previous research has shown that dogs more joyful wags Transport (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs are waving their tail predominantly left. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> Now, however, scientists say that the other dogs can these subtle differences in the movements of the tail of record and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neuroscientists from the University of Trento said: `` in humans, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain linked to have different incentives that create a positive or negative emotions. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1597"> The same thing we were trying to discern for other species. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> He added that, as with people, even in dogs is the right side of the brain responsible for left - handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> In an effort to get more information about how the dogs react to the lopsided wiggling tail other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals that watching movies on the other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyze their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Perhaps it will not be too long before we understand why it is their tail sometimes on the one hand, and on the other. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Professor Vallortigara said: `` we have reflected the dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of silhouettes - to get rid of any confusing initiatives, and we have also adjusted the movement of the tail and represent it more to the right or the left. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1603"> When the animals have seen otherwise mediocre dog move tail Transport (from the point of view of the dog &apos;s tail vrtějícího), remained totally at peace. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> But when the recorded video of the tail of predominantly left (again, from the point of view of the dog &apos;s tail vrtějícího), their heart rate has increased, and the animals seemed uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs through these movements knowingly communicate with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Rather, he believes that the dogs had learned from experience, which moves to and which need to be careful. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He said: `` if several times to meet with dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly manner and move right produces less friendly manner, you react on the basis of this experience. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1608"> The researchers say that the findings may owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers to help better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> An expert on the behaviour of dogs John Bradshaw, a university teacher of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study, which examined the left and right side for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned his head to the left, when watching aggressive dog, and to the right, when looking at the jolly dog. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> And in another essay specialist from the University of Victoria in Canada, said: `` the dog robot dogs more likely to show when the tail wagging the left than right when he became more insecure - quite the contrary to the italian study. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The difference may be given to him by dogs in these different studies of animals in the movies or dog robots talking quite like dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> He explained that might help studies on how dogs respond to the real dogs. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> `` Although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details are still to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> But given how easy it is to record their behaviour, probably will not be long before we can understand why it is their tail sometimes on the one hand, and on the other. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> RBS suspends two traders with foreign currency </seg>
<seg id="1617"> According to two people familiar with the situation suspended the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) two traders in their division with foreign currency, which is another sign that the global investigation control authorities regarding the shady things with currency market is becoming more common. </seg>

<seg id="1619"> These two traders would be the first RBS staff suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is a response to the scandal of manipulation of LIBOR (London interbank interest rate). </seg>
<seg id="1620"> The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that this month received a request for information from the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> `` Our continuing investigation in this case continues, and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities, &apos;&apos;said the bank two weeks ago. </seg>

<seg id="1629"> People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or from the competent authorities have received a request for information. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Banks are combing the years old with quick messages and e - mails to find cases of some offences. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Reports of investigations scared traders in the area, which has been one of the largest engine for profit in the accounts of the investment banks in the past few years, but which was disturbed by a small currency volatility limited opportunity for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Some bankers are trying to reduce the severity of the situation when he argued that with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency is virtually impossible, but senior traders say that it may not be true. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> A senior trader said that, despite the large volume of daily trading foreign currency dismemberment of liquidity between different trading platforms and increasing banks use their own internal platforms means that `` you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1634"> The report came on the same day that the company Credit Suisse announced that this week dismissed from his department for trading in shares of a trader who at the end of last year, has caused the loss of nearly 6 million USD. </seg>

<seg id="1914"> Something huge and nameless, similar to the movement of the continent on the planet, it affects our sensibility of such depth and breadth of such that is quite beyond our horizon - and as a matter of course we do in terms of your programmed award. </seg>

<seg id="1928"> Other significant items, changes are waiting for the next year. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> In a separate move the Ofqual, which oversees the graduation, reveals changes in the structure of graduation, and this, together with a new system of grading and smaller volume of projects for students. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> In his speech in the summer of Education Minister Michael Gove said that `` there is a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our system of rehearsal, to regain the trust of the company &apos;&apos;, and that there is a need to insist that the senior test was `` more demanding, more ambitious and more stringent&apos;&apos;. </seg>

<seg id="1935"> Mayor of cancer in Ostrava Kajnar Democrats I am: </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Before the elections, the full unveiled long - simmering dispute between the two wings of the fighting for influence in Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> It culminated in the Mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned to court because of the democratic candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> Players case it nevertheless they did not speak to the party before the election even more damage. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> They are now but electoral votes numbered. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The leadership of the Ostrava Democrats in Monday night called the mayor of Ostrava, stepped out of the party, and is likely to push for it to come to his office. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Peter Kajnar but wants to fight on. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> What in disputes is and who is on whose side, described in an exclusive interview in the journal. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> How do you see the outcome of the election? </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Democrats certainly count with a much better result. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Damage to her with us that before the election to address in the media disputes within the Party? </seg>
<seg id="1946"> I imagine that social democracy might have a better outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> But on the other side of the state, in what is now the Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> This is a party that has its own internal problems, is internally and sick people perceive it, that &apos;s all right. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> In the election that made it clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> What are the internal illness Democrats? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The decline for some time to me through the ODS and things like that, unfortunately, is now taking place in the social democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> So it is that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected their spoils find ODS, moved to the people in the CSSD and have influence over them. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> It has to do with the fact that after the offices of the Ostrava Oslo police goes and collects computers. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It shows that Democrats is composed of people who would like to the good of all the other, but many of them think primarily for the good of his own. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> Democrats are divided into two opposing camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between haškovci and Sobotkovci. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> But even that is already preparing for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> What occurred before the election in Ostrava, was just a taste of what is happening now in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Hašek &apos;s wing was gradually filled positions, then after the election could cause a situation that will weaken Sobotkovo wing. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> A man is in politics, in a situation where sometimes must compromise. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> But everyone has some internal border, when you do not have to compromise, and that is my case. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Initially, I did not want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, so I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek, to try to get to the regional candidate as Mayor of Ostrava strengthened just Sobotkovo wing. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Hašek &apos;s wing but it could stop. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Why are on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and no Michael Jaroslav Hašek? </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Slávek Sobotka, to me, is a man who always talk about the Democrats, and to some extent of visions for the party and for the country. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> I confess that, from the other side, I have heard of anything like that. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Michael Hašek just fighting for power. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> I do not see how the Bureau, which is lower than the authority of the central executive committee, to start just invoke President parties. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> It is a struggle for power regardless of all the articles of association and against the party. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> According to me what now Michael Hašek demonstrated in Prague, ended his political career. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> How did you feel that you are eyeing the leadership of the Social democratic candidate to endorse. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Political parties are based on competition, who are both from their members placed. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> The competition should be largely based on programming visions and capacity of the people you meet the vision. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Of course, in this competition reports and people who do not have much ability or vision, but political party is for them to lift the money elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The problem is, when these people begin to get to the forefront by unscrupulous violate rules violate the statutes of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Their practices are in the political parties and the Mafia to me that violate the laws of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> To draw attention to the problem is more important to me than to consider if it has any Kajnar a political future. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> It is important that the parties began to respect the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Therefore, you are handed a proposal before the elections to the court on the interim measures against any form of the Democrats in the moravian - silesian region? </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The current district executive committee Democrats in Ostrava consolidates his power by the organisation, which he does not, he can cancel of establishing the new organization, gradually thrashes uncomfortable Party members. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> An example is even wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from members of the club, but he appealed the and they then resolution on his exclusion rather canceled. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It shows that demand respect for the party through the courts is the last option, but at a time when the other ways and control authorities within the Democrats have ceased to work, it is the only option. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> Management tool eyeing the Democrats in the lead with Mr Adam Rykalou is to call you out of the position of the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> It is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post Poruby Lumír Palyza. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> As it is, and Adam Rykala Lumír Palyza tries to do everything to make me could appeal. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> People are promising positions, acquire voices and for those voices then cemented his power in the party. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> When I get back into the past, so everything that happened to be around the football club Miner Ostrava and purchase stadium Bazala, was just a pretext to me could attack. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> It was artificially staged, that I might be described as a man who gives money where it does not belong. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> The city bought the property, which has for him a great strategic value. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> So how do you see on your remaining as mayor of? </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The district committee was me and more people on Monday urged to consider his staying in. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> But I think it &apos;s like when a thief screams: thief! </seg>
<seg id="1992"> If you look at the results of my work for the last eleven years, so I do not see anyone in Ostrava social democracy, who initiated the push, and sometimes even against members of the party, the emergence of so many developing things, like industrial zones or expansion of science and technology park. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Despite everything, I become a nuisance. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> I do not read it differently than the way others to get through to the place, after which he covets. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> You will still have to fight against these efforts? </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Because if this Republic of good work, you must work well, and political parties. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state, if he can not even drive itself. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Now, I think, therefore, that left the Democrats, because I think that whoever causes cancer this side, I am not, but these people who are trying to drive me. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> We want to show that Pilsen still can win, promises Rajtoral </seg>
<seg id="2000"> It is a bit of a paradox. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> While his team is primarily through profit or loss in the last time can not come, defender or reliever Pilsen František Rajtoral Victoria has form, which earned him a year after returning to the team. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> He is also, full of fire activity, after surgery on him was in the game in Teplice ordered the penalty kick. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The balloon was in the last two rounds against Slavia and in France after the victory, but at the end of the two Duel took a point. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Frantisek Rajtoral believes that his team in the game with a series of unpleasant Jablonec breaks. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> We want to show that we can win. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> `` I believe that Jablonec home defeat, &apos;&apos;says František Rajtoral. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> The team is on a difficult struggle with severočechy who play offensive football, carefully prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> Everything points to a game with Jablonec, coach us well prepared, as always, we draw a lot of games videorozboru rivals. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> `` I believe that Friday night will be a great game, &apos;&apos;the czech player on the platform attracts fans Doosan Arena. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Pilsen last matches went awry, as they wish, but the word crisis defender Victoria refuses. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> So it goes in football, sometimes you are in good form and sometimes worse. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> But the crisis would in any case. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> `` I believe that we will win on Friday and again it will be good, &apos;&apos;says defender Západočechů. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> The Victoria will again rely on the support of the fans. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> `` It is played on a Friday night and I wanted our fans, who are great, invite. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2016"> `` I believe that we win, &apos;&apos;adds Rajtoral. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Defend academic freedom, it applies to squire and ODS. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> I have repeatedly in recent months, called on the open letter, students, teachers and the leadership of the middle and high schools in several counties to defend academic freedom before the election campaign, which carried out the president Milos Zeman at schools. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> I met with more or less success. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> The president of the Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to lecture honorary president SPOZ zemanovci - in the pre - election period, it even got revenge in the form of the invitation to celebrate the national holiday, the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Here is a list of schools, who already were brave and visit Milos Zeman allow: Technical University in Brno, the grammar school Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, College of Business in Cologne, J. E. Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Now in Pardubice meet with continuing pursuit of policies to universities. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The newly elected MEP for the ODS, Dean of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function, and it seems normal. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Professor, this really is not the same as if you had stayed in, for example, the mayor of a small city. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> Do you want to add to the generals Democrats who exercised at the same time as members and the governor and as they degrade the profession? </seg>
<seg id="2026"> The people say that can handle both of these functions. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> I know we have the example of Michael Jaroslav Hašek, which handles even a few dozen functions. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> But it probably is not just an example of the person that you should follow. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> I find the opposite and a positive example of M. D. Stepanka Fraňková, which she had left the post, that could be devoted to the leadership of the city of Pardubice. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main reason for my recommendation to leave as Dean, however, is that the combination of features you break apolitičnost academic soil Pardubice University. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Leadership Pardubice ODS sees your current action on both positions as a benefit for the university. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> `` Their &apos;&apos;school, however, you will be able to help, even without that, you will stay the dean. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> I think that, as I have a similar view and rector of Miroslav Ludwig, have your students. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Consider that even his resignation and keep his face. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Otherwise, you may be that the voters in the next election count. </seg>

<seg id="2041"> `` In some cases, I admit, as did the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and that it will not happen in the future, &apos;&apos;said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> In an interview, but he defended the practice. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> The collection of information to be necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, as were the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the US, the bombings in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> `` We have prevented the aircraft fell, the building exploded, and people were slaughtered, because we were able to be informed in time of plot, &apos;&apos;said Kerry. </seg>

<seg id="2052"> Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case, which was one of the staff associations YMCA accused of offences relating to child pornography, and on the other, the Physical in Caringbah associations of the YMCA in 1991, he was convicted of a sexual harassment of children in their care. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Mr Hare said Gaili Furnessové, adviser to the Commission that he knew about the case, but not the second. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> He admitted that the initial statements YMCA associations were also inaccurate, as stated in the organisation of the YMCA to carry out external audits, priced by the organisation as a leading advocate of the rights of children. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> The evidence presented by the Commission says that the organisation YMCA was informed that the audit of the Department of Education and the company of August this year received the second lowest of four possible evaluation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Mr Hare, which began with the Association of YMCA work when he was 21, he admitted that the leadership from him down failed when Mr Lord adopted without assurances, whether he is aware of the staff of the obligation to notify security breaches of children. </seg>

<seg id="2062"> The Director - General said that it does not accept evidence of personnel that they felt uncomfortable, if they had contacted their superiors and deeds of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Instead, he said, that their friendship with Lord dimmed their judgment, and therefore failed to report the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Mr Hare said that the association of the YMCA in New South Wales told its view that the lessons learned from the case of Jonathan `` Lord &apos;&apos;for the organisation, lies in the fact that staff `` filed no report&apos;&apos;, and the council agreed with him. </seg>

<seg id="2092"> We frankly tired of that look like `` guards &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> But the surfing the Internet, e - mail and sms or downloading data to remain below 3 miles altitude of the disabled, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Passengers will be notified that their smart phones, tablets and other devices switched into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> And still no words with friends, online game of Scrabble, played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from aircraft American Airlines, because he refused to shut down their equipment when the plane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> And heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that someone could get hurt if flying around the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Calls from mobile phones will be on board remains banned. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The rules for the use of mobile phones to designate the FAA, but the US Federal Committee for telecommunications. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The FAA may in some electronic equipment during take - off and landing lift the ban. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Committee for Safety in transport, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, he said that mobile phones are still considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> `` Mobile phones are really the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation equipment, but data from the FCC also know that in the air can cause interference of broadcasting tower, &apos;&apos;said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> The trade advisory committee created by the administration of the FAA, therefore, to examine the problem, last month suggested that the government allowed the wider use of electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The FAA in recent years has been pressured to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Critics like Senator Claire McCaskillová, Democrat of Missouri, argues that there is no valid safety reason for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> Restrictions are also becoming difficult to enforce, because of the use of such devices is ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers and forgets to turn off their devices or ignored. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry the FM radio, technical achievement of that time. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> New airlines are much more reliant on the electrical systems of the aircraft than previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA management that they are immune to electronic jamming. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Airlines have for several years, offered to passengers use Wi - Fi in travel altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Plans for the Wi - Fi systems are also more resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Most of the big airlines under the new rules should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices, said Huertová. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> The current electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio broadcast, than it was to the facilities of previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> For example, the electronic reader issued in turning the page only minimum broadcasting. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> But television is stronger when devices downloading or uploading data. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Among those who are pushing for it to be free of restrictions on the use of such devices by passengers, is Amazon. Com. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> In 2011 by representatives of the company &apos;s transport plane loaded with its electronic reader Kindle and carried out the test flight, but no problem emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose a risk. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots, designed to promote the fact that such devices may cause interference air systems, and most of these reports is very old. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> However, the committee recommended that the FAA pilots allowed ordered the passengers off the device during the instrument flying in low visibility. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> The travel industry welcomed the changes and the terms under a sensible approach for the travelling public, which technology used in profusion. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> `` We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that pleasant travel experience is not in breach of security, &apos;&apos;said Roger Dow, the executive director of the U. S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="2131"> I assure you that in this process is not to abuse the rights of innocent people. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA seeks good and that its surveillance operation had saved many lives. </seg>

<seg id="2584"> A peaceful day by the end of August, the german police helicopter buzzed over an american consular office in Frankfurt, the main town of the german economy. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the german domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was a photograph of the roof of the american outposts, which is situated less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The german media claims that the BfV hoping she will be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and this action began in Berlin exchange of views between the american and german foreign minister. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, in September again insisted that the United States used its foreign intelligence capabilities, `` to stealing commercial secrets of foreign companies in favour of US companies and strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2588"> But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant collaborator, began to reveal their valuable collection of spying on the United States, european governments and business leaders I do not know if they have the words of the trust. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> After the news that the US National Security Agency reconnaissance in the brazilian oil company, gained access to the data, with whom they have american cloudoví providers, including Google and Yahoo, reached the general paranoia about the monitoring of the new dimensions. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> The last straw came with the revelation that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel was maybe ten years bugged. </seg>

<seg id="2596"> Throughout the dossier exposed Mr Snowden, but so far there is no evidence that the United States transmit the commercial secrets of foreign companies in their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks a certain abilities in the area of it and the Internet, and said that it should be trying to reduce its dependence on the US: </seg>

<seg id="2603"> Everything in Germany subsidises, from coal to cars and farmers. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Everything except the it industry. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> The scope and the technical maturity of american spy agencies found Snowden is for some companies who have considered that the biggest threat of monitoring is China, still shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> There is a large turnover in cloudové computing, where european leaders on a wider scale, realised that the data stored in the US fall under its jurisdiction, and are therefore potentially challenged. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> According to a survey carried out by the business community Cloud security alliance of approximately 10 percent of american members after the discovery of the US Prism on data mining canceled plans to use cloudového provider based in the US. </seg>

<seg id="2616"> Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the automakers - Audi, says that for many years, it is common practice to gather before the meeting of the Board of directors of the mobile phones, that they can not be used as a listening device. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The german BfV managers advised to consider whether or not to use on foreign trips, simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk that the smart phones can be safeguarded. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> However, there is concern that small and medium - sized businesses will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas of the leaders of the global market. </seg>

<seg id="2626"> The new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> A single dose of vaccine could for life to protect the mouse in front of addiction to nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Before the trials on people &apos;s need to carry out further tests, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, says that the first signs are good. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> `` We certainly hope that this type of vaccine strategy may finally help millions of smokers who try to stop and have exhausted all methods available today in the market, but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches to overcome, &apos;&apos;said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry the genetic information to create antinikotinových antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> The virus infects the liver cells selectively, then start to create a continuous stream of these antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The antibodies are all nicotine molecules in the blood stream and neutralise them before they get into the brain, thereby preventing the smoker got nicotine hit. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> In vaccinated mice, which was subsequently delivered nicotine, continued their normal activities. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> But the mice, which have not been vaccinated, `` calmed &apos;&apos;, said the researchers, which is a sign that nicotine to get into the brain. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> Previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The injections had to be given so often, in order to maintain a sufficient level of antibodies, so have proved expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> The costs of the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert the liver cells at the plant for the production of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Professor Crystal said that if the future of vaccine for people are completely safe, they could bring children before they will be tempted to try a cigarette, and this would avoid the nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> More likely it would use smokers to quit. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> `` They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine of no benefit, and it will help them with this habit to break, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> British scientists said that the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> A desperate cry of Obama &apos;s voters </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Obama was elected twice - I hope for a possible change </seg>
<seg id="2646"> He says that Obama &apos;s sincere efforts to derail the obstruction of the Republican Party </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Obstructive policy can not excuse the woes of Web pages of Obama &apos;s health care or drone aircraft attacks </seg>
<seg id="2648"> Memoirs of the Obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could happen </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Nathaniel P. Morris of the second year of a medical student at Harvard. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> These days I read very sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> On this book, I thought of me during the dark days of my second year at medical school will encourage and restore in me a glimmer of hope. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> It &apos;s called `` the Audacity to Win &apos;&apos;(the audacity to victory), and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> When the evening finish reports of patients, and I am going to bed, the book me back to a time when policy has inspired millions of people and the speeches you breathless. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> The elections were overwhelming and television news force us to think about the historical value of this moment. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> My classmates wept with joy and my parents were hiding, the newspaper found. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The White House team headed young visionaries and the nation was ready for a change. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> During the inauguration in 2008, Obama should support 82 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> And here I am closing the book. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> Go to today &apos;s rough awakening, like waking up from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> It &apos;s hard to remember these optimistic days - seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> In the years after I threw his first election ballot, really has to change. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> It was not what I had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law on the care available over the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and an end to the policy of `` not to ask questions, to say nothing &apos;&apos;after the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> In addition, I am convinced that the partisan obstruction reverse many efforts to move our nation forward: among the other &apos;s immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánámu. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> But after many situations where I am in front of colleagues and friends said the Obama administration, I am on the explanation, which can provide, came to the absolute limit. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> I was in a place of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Obstruction of the Republicans can not explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders, even with the raids drones, which are killing innocent children overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> They can not explain it, that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, or even that haunts the misconduct of government reveals. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> They can not be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al - Awlakího, an american citizen, without proper court for reducing public contributions and spending during the presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> They can not justify the findings of the report, which says that the White House &apos;s efforts to muzzle the media are `` aggressive... from the Nixon administration. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2671"> And most recently, can not excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on the care available simple Web pages. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> I do not know whether something like this could be expected. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Whether I had in the 18 years that the government may be in breach of political campaigns that preceded it. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> An elected office apparently does not have a predictable pattern and our public conversations will shape the opposition political party and the random events like a massacre in Newton. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> But all of the examples I mentioned above, is largely the result of his own seem to be the administration &apos;s decision. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> And that &apos;s what worries me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Mitt Romney was confused and honed alternative and seemed unable to consolidate its policy or position. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, which we had heard. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Still, it is a return to 2008 - with the aid of Obama this week dropped below 45% - through this book is increasingly difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It forces me to remember that many of the promises that were lost. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama during the primaries in Pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> For additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff to get back into the groove and remain faithful to their mission. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> `` I want to get back to our magic, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>

<seg id="2736"> Early puberty advanced earlier: </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Research has shown that - selected african - american women and Hispánky reaching puberty earlier than their caucasian contours. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The physical changes mean that approaching puberty </seg>
<seg id="2739"> There is no evidence for this are hormones or other chemicals </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Experts say that one of the triggers of the earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The trend is not so evident earlier puberty for boys. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children &apos;s health and family problems. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The mother of a shock, when her daughter to grow breasts and pubic hair at the groin in 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="2744"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of paediatric doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, explained the paediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes between american girls are fairly common, and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> `` A lot of the time I spent my parents said that it is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty, &apos;&apos;said Kaplowitz </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Visible signs of development, as is the growth of chest hair at the groin and under his arm and body odor, the girls there earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> In the last 40 years, however, he was just a small shift in age at the time of the first period. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> In the United States, is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to age 12,75 years in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> `` When you start to develop breasts, expire at least two to three years before the first period, &apos;&apos;said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book `` early puberty in girls: the Essential Guide to Coping with this Common Problem&apos;&apos; (early puberty in girls: essential guide to manage this problem of frequent) </seg>
<seg id="2750"> The most reliable test of how she will continue, it &apos;s time. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> It is discussed what activates the real beginning puberty, but if it is accompanied by the growth of breast growth spurt before 8 years of age, she is considered `` prematurely mature. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2752"> In most cases, the process slows or stops - which may pediatricians closely monitored. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist carried out tests in order to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to stop the growth and dwarfism in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment depends on the age of the child, the speed of development, the speed of growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Also important are the psycho - sociological aspects. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> When it comes to medication, is careful Kaplowitz, but acknowledges that `` the suppression of puberty may reduce the problems with the behaviour of the girl and her emotions that are different from their peers. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Understandable is another big problem: parents simply do not want their very young daughters periods. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> `` They are worried that it may become pregnant, or how it would handle the hygiene, &apos;&apos;said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> `` It was a shock, &apos;&apos;says one woman, whose daughter began to have periods in 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Although there were indications of menstruation and we spoke, she was not prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> She came home from school frightened and angry, she is of her friends first. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> There are many well - known theories about the causes of premature puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Still, there is no consistent evidence that they are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> The boys - like girls are reaching puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Kaplowitz promotes the presumption that the biggest reason is an epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> In 2001, he helped to carry out the study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which combines the body fat to the timing of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Other findings to this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> In this country have - selected african - american women and Hispánky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Explanations are different. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> From a global perspective, it seems that the patterns of early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions across the climate to genes. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Another puzzle: although the boys at a young age appears hair in her face and groin, the trend towards full flowering early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of paediatricians (AAP) added to this subject more complexity. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Acne, or her pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> `` We have to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty, &apos;&apos;said Lawrence Silverman, paediatric endocrinologist from Goryebské Children &apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Parents should not hesitate to get from your child &apos;s doctor instructions on how to talk to their children. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> `` It may mean the need to talk with the child sooner than you expected, &apos;&apos;said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> The girls that are developing earlier, they need reassurance that, although it is early, this process is a normal part of life. </seg>

<seg id="2791"> Israel refused to comment on the report, but the military analyst Ron Ben Yishai said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah rockets and the syrian Air Force teaches members of Hezbollah &apos;s armed section with rockets. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> SA - 8 are outdated rockets, which has the syrian army since the 1980 s. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> They are placed on the chassis. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Even though they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small size is possible, it is easy to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> They are equipped with radar, but after firing missiles off, so it &apos;s hard to focus. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Latákíja lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by reigning alávity. </seg>

<seg id="2808"> If the Social Democrats into several weeks of tough, sit around a table with a perfect partners, who put on the table a list of requirements, including the ministerial posts. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> The envoys Democrats then either swallow sour grapes, nodded to the coalition or nothing short of a minority government. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> Bohuslav Sobotka after four days, when he carried on a wave of sympathy for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Yesterday he could not control the political body, and especially to force a convicted liar, to resign. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> A negotiator for the party, he is the only other team members will leave to after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (DVV). </seg>
<seg id="2813"> I apologized to the members of the panel, and now the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> He does not have to lie in your personal life, not in public. </seg>

<seg id="2820"> Both members then declared that they will do all it can to 50 - strong club Democrats was one voice. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The absurd theater put crown Michal Hašek sentence: `` I am a member of the Social democratic fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I respected the decision of the party bodies. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2822"> So another lie in direct transmission. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Or, perhaps, in a call for his resignation and Sobotkově exclusion from the negotiating team, I forgot that August DVV with 57 percent held that the Bohuslav Sobotka is the candidate for prime minister? </seg>
<seg id="2824"> The Democrats, however, summoning DVV until next Sunday, the army made powerful enemies. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> His opponents have ten days to flood the e - mails 192 members of this body, and the media a variety of gossip and rumor, possibly commemorated the real error Sobotkovy political career. </seg>

<seg id="2885"> In the case of air carriers in the US, the impact of the legislation, the company will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can not tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, and also to revise the manual training material, programs for hand luggage and information for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> `` As soon as the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, passengers can afford to use portable and easy electronic devices, such as tablets and smart phones, electronic reader at any altitude, &apos;&apos;the FAA said. </seg>
