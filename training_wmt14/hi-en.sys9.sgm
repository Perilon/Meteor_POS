<seg id="571"> Previous research has found that the Naved dog his tail are more shake the right (the dog), while the restless dogs to their tail mainly are more left to shake. </seg>
<seg id="572"> But now scientists say that the fellow dog-tailed this can identify the subtle differences and can express their response. </seg>
<seg id="573"> In this study, published in the Journal current biology. </seg>
<seg id="574"> Trento neuroscientist professor from the University of Georgia vellrtigra said: &quot;All of this in humans know very well that the left and the right part of the brain that in the excitement, including the different manner that generated the positive or negative feelings.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> Here, we also in the other species, it has decided to see. </seg>
<seg id="576"> He said that even in the dogs, like humans, the right part of the brain antics of the left hand and was responsible for the opposite order, and in the spirit of two golarddhon has played different roles. </seg>
<seg id="577"> In this regard to know more than that the dog and other dogs how on the unilateral move by the reaction, the researchers see films of the other dogs tracked the animals. </seg>
<seg id="578"> He was the heart of the domestic dogs measured the Dhadkan and analysis of their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="579"> We understand, probably did not take more time in that one side of his tail, on the other hand, why is shaken. </seg>

<seg id="581"> When the animals to their tail a stolid dog on the right (the dog) saw shake, they are completely from the rest. </seg>
<seg id="582"> But when he was tailed by changing the direction of the left side of the main form of a dog (again) looked like, his heart was increasing and they Dhadkan uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Prof. According to vellrtigra they don&apos;t think that the dog through these antics intentionally dialogue with each other. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Instead, they think that the dogs, it is learned from his experience that they must be worried at the Harkat what and what is not on. </seg>
<seg id="585"> He said: &quot;If you want to get to the other dogs have many times, and if they continue to only one side of the tail flicking, it is associated with a more friendly behavior, and the right part is less Dostana behavior, you have the same reaction on the basis of experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="586"> The researchers say that these conclusions owners, animal trainers and doctors about the feelings of the animals can provide better information. </seg>
<seg id="587"> University of Bristol&apos;s School of Veternary Sciences&apos;s guest fell, the dog&apos;s behavior expert John Bradshaw said that its test for this is not the first study that the dogs to the left or the right part of the important or not. </seg>
