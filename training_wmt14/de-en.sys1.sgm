<seg id="126"> But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a celebration meal, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Free medical care is really a cause for celebration in these villages and Bwelle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is to the joyful celebration. </seg>
<seg id="128"> The next morning the team then starts with the examination of hundreds of patients. </seg>

<seg id="138"> &quot;They drums all the night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday, the team then goes back in the city, tired, but proud of the work. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group -- a mixture of kamerunischen doctors and foreign medical students -- last year 700 free operations and know that their work has made a huge difference for the people who it helps. </seg>
<seg id="141"> A man said that the free operation of bars of which he received, he is allowed to return to work. </seg>

<seg id="146"> He is either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation, so that it can go on these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medical and nursing students such as O&apos;Malley, the support from the US and Europe and Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; O&apos;Malley says. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That would be never possible in America as a medical student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students pay for their own trip to Cameroon normally and bring often donated Sanität material. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accepts the accommodation, transport and guidance. </seg>
<seg id="152"> &quot;He is undoubtedly a hero,&quot; says O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> He dedicated his life to this organisation and its desire to help the people of Cameroon, knows no borders. </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle is the almost constant work is not a burden. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Other to achieve a better life and to fulfil a promise that his father gave him great pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="156"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy, if I make this work,&quot; Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I am thinking of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope he does, what I do. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain. </seg>

<seg id="164"> There are currently 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="165"> However, a cardinal, has reached the age of 80 years, can no longer take part in the Pope election -- this is a group of 120 &quot;Wahlberechtigten Kardinälen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> In a statement, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said the news was announced, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="167"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce its decision to convene the Konsistoriums in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of Kardinälen from all over the world, can be planned,&quot; Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices, said that the number of eligible cardinals to February will probably be dropped. </seg>
<seg id="169"> He said that a Pope ernenne normally so many cardinals as necessary to keep the number of eligible cardinals 120 betrage, and so many cardinals over 80, as it wishes. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The consistory next year is important, because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> At the moment, there is a certain Überhang aufseiten of Europe and particularly in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will be appointing cardinals from the rest of the world, to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Kardinälen. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed to the Council established since the formation of the Francis cardinals, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world, have the task of finding ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In the past, the Pope decided everything alone. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He said that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis, the cardinals ask for advice. </seg>
<seg id="178"> But so far, we have not been in this situation -- this is all very new. </seg>

<seg id="190"> We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside Europe and focused on countries to modernise and grow, while the states in the EU will stagnate. </seg>
<seg id="191"> They want that the government side new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil favorisiert, instead of concentrating on the long and arduous process to reform the obskuren EU institutions. </seg>

<seg id="194"> Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants a direction change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics. </seg>
<seg id="195"> This is in leading corporations and companies of all sizes shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change,&quot; the issue of action back to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="196"> It is much better conditions for Britain -- an amendment of the agreement and 16 percent would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the re-negotiation of the British conditions for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="198"> It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the eurozone moved towards closer economic and Fiskalunion now. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which for businesses means a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the approach to Brussels regulations. </seg>

<seg id="594"> James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, maintaining once again that the US no opportunities of foreign espionage einsetzten in September, &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to ensure that their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="595"> But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower that former employees with the publication of his Füllhorns started of US surveillance secrets, heads of European governments and companies are no longer sure that they can take the manager at his word. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Reports that the US National Security Agency and the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, the companies paranoia for state supervision to a new peak. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s phone verwanzt, perhaps ten years. </seg>

<seg id="599"> Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I believe that it is conceivable that these data be used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="602"> German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey, published in July by the consultancy firm EY. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In the leaked documents from Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the US passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet options and they should reduce their dependence on the United States. </seg>

<seg id="609"> If you had a strong European IT industry 20 years ago, it would not disappear. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal cars to agriculture. </seg>

<seg id="612"> However, the scope and technical sophistication of the Snowden revelations have shocked US spying authorities revealed companies which had seen the greatest risk of espionage in China. </seg>
<seg id="613"> The cloud computing is a big change, because European executives are now aware that the data stored in the US jurisdiction and are therefore potentially dangerous. </seg>

<seg id="616"> Many German executives believe that the recent reports just confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and, therefore, they must be guarded at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="617"> That economic espionage is taking place, is no surprise. </seg>
<seg id="618"> This has always been the case. </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;It was an issue for many years and the current discussion has not fundamentally changed,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The Americans also spionieren on commercial and industrial level, as we do this, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>

<seg id="624"> The German BAT advises managers, easy to use prepaid phones, when they go on trips abroad, because smartphones may be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The prepaid phones are thrown away. </seg>
<seg id="626"> However, there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="627"> In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the niche. </seg>
<seg id="628"> &quot;Small and medium-sized enterprises often do not have the experience, the staff and the financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access,&quot; the BAT warns in a report. </seg>

<seg id="978"> Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the tail Wedeln of a dog with its mood. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Previous research had shown that happy dog with the tail wags more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while the left side was nervous dogs. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But now, scientists say that other dogs and respond to these subtle differences. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Trento, said: &quot;the people is well aware that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli, the positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, we have tried to look at this in other species. </seg>
<seg id="983"> He also said that dogs, like humans the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> To learn more about how dogs react to the side tail Wedeln their own species, the researchers monitored the animals, while these films other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="985"> They measured the heart rate of the Vierbeiner and analysierten behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> We will probably understand why the tail in one, sometimes in the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we have shown the dogs films with dogs -- either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="988"> If the animals saw an otherwise ausdruck dog has moved the cart to the right (from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they remained completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="989"> But the tail was mainly left again (from the perspective of the dog wedelt), their heart rate rose and they saw unruhig. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara the dogs not deliberately communicate with each other by these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, what movements they should worry and when not. </seg>
<seg id="992"> He said: &quot;if you have several meetings with other dogs and the Wedeln with the cock in a direction more linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produced a less friendly behaviour, we responded on the basis of this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the findings could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal dog owners, veterinarians and trainers. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medical science at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study investigated whether the left and right is essential for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs, if they see an aggressive dog, turn the head left and right, if it is a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said: &quot;dogs go on to be a robot dog, tail&apos; wedelt left rather than right, rather than being unruhig -- exactly the opposite than in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to his statement, hence the differences that the dogs could not interpreted as dogs in the various studies of animals in the movies or the robot dogs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said. </seg>
<seg id="999"> &quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two halves of the brain used for various purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined, and dogs are no exception,&quot; says Bradshaw. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, since their behaviour simply aufzeichnen, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail moved sometimes in one direction, sometimes in the other. </seg>

<seg id="1103"> At the end of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> In June the government revised the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed line between London and the north of England of GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, HS 2 Ltd mandated to seek further route capacity and journey time improvements to northern England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;our goal for HS 2 is a truly national network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1108"> We are proceeding with HS 2, because it brings enormous benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> The Scottish Secretary Alistair Car Michael commented: &quot;today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1112"> On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Car called Michael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> Brown said: &quot;the high-speed rail has the potential enormous economic benefits for Scotland, at the same time, the economic strength of Scotland also provides an argument for high-speed rail links across Britain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1114"> We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, the Scottish Government is already planning. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> I look forward to the report together with the British ministers in the next year to examine and decide on the next steps. </seg>

<seg id="1118"> Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, with a lot of green, old trees, nice neighbours and not too much traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> In the city are only a few minutes by public transport. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> &quot;I hope they have no fear of spiders?&quot; asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider on the door frame. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> I have been looking for some time for a new home for my husband and me. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age no longer able to tackle the many steps to the house and in the apartment, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition, since the Mittfünfzigerin has experienced a Meniskus operation, what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Recently it is a book published on happy living in the age- what home form is the best for me?&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> &quot;Our apartment is the best example of what the age is not&apos;, it begins to tell. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> When more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was simply a nice apartment in the middle of the Greens. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Today by mid-fifty Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> But they also know that it is one of the few people who could deal with the issue of living in the age&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Most of the crowd, as long as it is. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Old are only the other,&apos; she says schmunzelnd. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Only when the pressure is really suffering, do we have to consider. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &quot;But it may also be too late, as Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined housing in the age. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> &apos;What home form one chooses, is always an individual decision,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> D i e solution there is not for the age. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Even those who can afford the pensions seat in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could be sick. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> And: &quot;without a good knowledge of the language same in Dolce Vita,&quot; the Fachbuch author Aussiedlung willing to consider. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Its models include classical models, alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners -WG. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> In the age, everyone he ticks and quirks </seg>
<seg id="1141"> &quot;For me it would be a residential community but nothing,&quot; she says with a wink. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Certainly not like a student-with a common bathroom and a kitchen. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> &apos; You just need also his retreat,&quot; says Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> However, a senior living community work, the author does not want to exclude. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> But that must then differently than in the traditional Studenten -WG. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> And sometimes if you simply want to even its calm&apos;, she believes. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> With this opinion, it is in the country&apos;s capital, at least not alone. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> &quot;Most elderly people want to remain in their own homes as long as it is in Stuttgart&apos;, is the experience of Teresa Rütten, the head of the civil service in the age of the provincial capital. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Its service advises people around the issue &apos;Älter&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Therefore, it would only accept older people often Unbequemlichkeiten and restrictions in order to be able to remain in their familiar surroundings, it is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> There are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Ries recommends that all the dealing with the old fair remodeling their house or apartment, first to inform thoroughly and not only the best craftsmen. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Today, there is also for the old fair reconstruction specialists. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Even in the rental achieve one or the other, and if it can only be the toilet seat is increasing, the interior designer. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But not always, the existing housing so old and free umgestalten, even if it is so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> This experience had Waltraud Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> You may install a stairlift within the apartment, but the area also paved way to the front door, the far greater obstacle. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> They will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for themselves and their man. </seg>

<seg id="1190"> Basharat Ditta, 42, provides underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he was compromised by its own cocaine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The detective hailed as &quot;a lawyer, nicknamed &quot;Bash,&quot;was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had overseen Scarborough, which he represented in a previous drug procedures. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Officials saw Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine in the House of Anwalts in Blackburn, Lancashire, hers, was with colleagues during a meal of the Bar. </seg>

<seg id="1194"> Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he unerlaubt to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> All four suspects were part of a major investigation by the police procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>

<seg id="1202"> Shortly after he had delivered the drugs telefonierte Scarborough regularly with Ditta, which was at a dinner in the Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park football stadium. </seg>

<seg id="1211"> The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer, his lawyer with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> One part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> He was the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Mr Ditta said that his profession into disrepute. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> He stood too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that his independence is compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> Ditta rejected any wrongdoing and said: &quot;if I were a corrupt prosecutor, I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1218"> But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: &quot;Mr Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1245"> The Council adopted track facilities targeted </seg>
<seg id="1246"> &quot;The Hirschen&quot; consuming the railway crossing should be converted to improve road safety? </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Yes, the local authorities have decided. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> Schiltach needs to 220,000 euros in the hands. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal line in the coming year. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is particularly to increase the safety of crossings are regularly to collisions of trains with other vehicles in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> The restructuring measures to the communities, they must agree with a third of the cost involved, the rest are rail and federal. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schiltachs city architect Roland Griesshaber explained to the council the nature of the Bah Übergangs &quot;the Hirschen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There is the Mundes west of the city, to the tune of the tunnel, to build a bulge. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> There could also greater transport vehicles, for example, those long wood, in turn, without having to block the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Griesshaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary Stützmauer so that the city could expand the road when the time comes, to ensure a smooth traffic flow. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This has been controversial and discussed in the council, as some councils the need for road proliferation in doubt: Thomas Kipp brought to the mood of critics took to the point: &quot;we have so much money in the hands of so few vehicles?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas said: the railway crossing &quot;Hirschen&quot; will regularly used for the transport of long timber. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even &quot;Kuhbach&quot;will be transported by this route, in part, because the wood from the area up to 20 metres long vehicles could use the route to the Häberles bridge, not because they could not turn in the road. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In addition, serve the route as Umleitungfür those vehicles, not allowed to use the tunnel, Haas argued that if the main road is blocked. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Since abzusehen that Kirchberg and Schloss Berg tunnel could be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing an important transport,&quot; the &quot;Hirschen&quot; for a longer period. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The council agreed to investigate the costs which would cause angedachte broaden the road. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway Übergangs was agreed with the proviso that the required majority Stützmauer is built in such a way that the city may encounter for transport to the road &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot; around 5.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The renovation of the transition to the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a different problem that affects the ansteigenden &quot;geroltz houses in the road.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The administration was the Umbaupläne train from Engineering Breinlinger examined, since it had doubts as to whether the planned then the Geroltz houses is still perfectly possible. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation concluded that it cannot be excluded that the gradient of the road that could lead to longer vehicles aufsitzen. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The responsibility for wear in the city as road Baulast winner. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The restructuring could therefore entail liability disputes. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> As both the wood Abfuhr and the Abbiegen worked in the current state of development, argued that we should not approve the reconstruction of the rail Übergangs Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> It is also the risk of a collision with a train car at the transition significantly lower than the other crossings, because the stopping point directly to the middle, there is a good line of sight. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Even if abgebremst trains from the main train station at this point would be that no risk of collision. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The majority of this rail refuses to give its assent to the transition as the city Schiltach had the problem with sitting vehicles &quot;ausbaden, Räte,&quot; as the railways could withdraw after the conclusion of the work of the responsibility. </seg>

<seg id="1377"> Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The announcement came a day before the date of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) </seg>
<seg id="1379"> November 1, the organisation based in The Hague Damascus, to destroy all chemical weapons production facilities or to make &quot;inoperabel,&quot; including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all Syria&apos;s chemical weapons by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Damascus has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin gas in the country. </seg>

<seg id="1393"> The observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The fighting underscores the risk of the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a raging civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, is the team &quot;now convinced that all-important production and mixing/filling facilities, and their destruction of Syria has witnessed.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1428"> Editor Andy Coulson, the former News of the Word &quot;phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation&quot; in trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005 a false rumour that heard that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot;special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby attractive. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack pawlbys voicemails, and pursued them, but Coulson also called and left messages, the court heard. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> &quot;Now the state is Anwaltschaft Coulson, the editor of the NotW, no one believes that, before the housing of people, and it hopes to delicto ertappen, but faced with a history of a people like to see their reaction,&quot; said Edis. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> He said that NotW use three procedures, in order to investigate stories investigators: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The publisher is personally involved in the third method. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Obviously, he knows of the second monitoring, it cannot be different. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> What is it with the first? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> He knows about the phone-hacking? </seg>
<seg id="1437"> He denies that, but we say: &quot;and whether he knew.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Clark&apos;s rumors of an affair were first adopted by the feature editors of NotW, a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: &quot;do not waste your time, it is with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions, Mulcaires apartment in August 2006. </seg>

<seg id="1444"> Edis said that Coulson&apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: faster erwachsen. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age Genossinnen, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical changes mean not the puberty </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger for early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialises in child health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A mother should be concerned if their daughter grow breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight years? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida children Medical Association, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical change is relatively normal among American girls and represents a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> &quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents -- usually there is no sign that the puberty occurs quickly,&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> The ads of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Men Ark (the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States the average age of 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;If the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to early puberty in girls,&quot; says Kaplowitz, author of &quot;Men Ark often auftretenden: the essential guide to deal with this problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Time is the most accurate test, such as puberty progresses. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is controversial, which is the beginning of puberty, but it is &quot;early ripe,&quot; if the breast augmentation accompanied by a growth in an age of eight years. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases, the process is slowed down or stalled -- something that a pediatrician can closely monitor. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Faster progress could be displayed by a Endikronologen tests so that serious problems like tumors or cysts can be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defence of another result: the premature aging of the bones, which may ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body Wuchs in adults. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a pharmacological or hormonal therapy is based on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth and the emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psycho social aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz is cautious when it comes to drugs, but he admits: &quot;the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age Genossinnen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they manage the hygienic side,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter with ten their days. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in their circle of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Young girls are similar earlier in the puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> In 2001, he supported the implementation of a study on girls aged six to nine years, the link between body fat and the entry into the puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age Genossinnen. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are different explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Global seems to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Another puzzle: although boys face and Schambehaarung already growing, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as high as for girls. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other doctors on the AAP conference highlights the complexity of the issue. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The emergence of acne and pubic hair is even in infants and young children. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> &quot;We have to be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician, as they should talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;This may mean that you must carry on a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; Kaplowitz advised. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If we remain quiet, the child normally reacts well. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Girls, early erblühen need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens earlier than expected. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Illmensee: second mountain bike race participants enthusiastic </seg>

<seg id="1601"> Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff accusations against Jonathan Lord accused of sex </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) have been accused of sex offences relating to children, charges against the childcare Jonathan Lord from Caringbah before 2011, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> But the opening statement to the Commission the YMCA had said it had &quot;never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organisation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1604"> CEO Phillip Hare has been consulted on a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another at the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 a sports teacher was convicted of the abuse of children entrusted to him. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer, knew that he had known from the first case, but not the second. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also vague in the statement, &quot;we have external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare, with 21 the YMCA started, admitted the management had failed &quot;from me on downwards&quot; in the recruitment of Lord and not ensured that staff were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two years for the YMCA at the beginning of the year. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> He was sentenced to at least six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Hare argued, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem, the employees have held Lords violations in relation to the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, for private as a babysitter, they have a said that he would like to sit on his lap, and let children play with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Danielle Ockwell, whose leader Lord was and had asked for a training on child protection, because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the children of the supervisors in YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, the Lords was &quot;very intimidating and most of the time was very remote.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The CEO said he would not accept statements by employees that they have not had the courage to report back to their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord have impaired their judgment why they had not reported him. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Hare said that he was the chairman of the YMCA NSW, the organisation shared his view that the lesson to be drawn from the Jonathan Lord incident,&quot;&quot; not the Melden&quot;by staff betreffe, and the Board voted in favour. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Hare said that the decision to push the staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations had been made by the director of children&apos;s services, Liam Whitley, YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He said that it should prevent contamination of the evidence, but had been &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly implemented. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The YMCA NSW is in the period between 2009 and 2011, when Jonathan Lord was employed, not for children safe organisation, said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sex abuse of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> He explained that there are &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of staff. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The hearing was postponed until December 20. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Tourism: descend to the Romans </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Cologne is around 120 metres below a water from the Roman times. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Visiting Cologne, the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Approximately 157 metres from the two towers in the sky, making it the second-highest church building of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> But only a few visitors, the two filigranen Kirchtürme bestaunen anticipated that there is a lot to discover in the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Pit. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Meeting place for tourism directly on its tours is the centre of Cologne Cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The tour starts very unspectacular beginnings: &quot;we are in the garage,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a fair city, and therefore only what remained of the remains of the old city wall was not too great. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most of the users of the Park House, therefore, today the Roman over and only your car. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking D 2 an archaeological site separated by metal bars. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> There are about five meters high ruins of handteller large stones. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;There are remains of the Roman city wall, built in the second half of the first century after Christ,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before it goes back to light, Schulze participants on the upper park level leaves a look in a dark, 15-meter shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> The next step of the Prätorium, and there the participants back down into the depths. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> We see the office of the most powerful man north of the Alps, the Prätors of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;It stands for&quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ,&quot; which in Roman law as much as&quot; town and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius on the place of the altar for the Kaiser cult &quot;means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> And the Prätorium is the former Statthalter Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> From the lobby of the exhibition introduces a tunnel access to the Roman sewer of around 120 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> &quot;You can go one step along the so-called Cloaca Maxima along, if you want,&quot; Schulze the guests. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> A surprise Schulze has. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> He has brought to the Cashier key, he leads the group to a 16-meter begehbaren shaft. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> &quot;We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Jewish community built their bath deep in the soil to the groundwater, which was essential for ritual ablution. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> To date, in the bottom of the mikvah, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing the level of the Rhine brushstrokes. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for the work should begin shortly. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Until the completion but a few years. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> Land Rover Rally Series announced </seg>

<seg id="1653"> The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package of care of Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;the Rally to Bowler, customers who have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1655"> They are not all experienced cyclists, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and a achievable path to world-class events. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We are pleased to be able to open this road in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities, the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and newcomers to prepare for the Strapazen and the reality of Rally Raid. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> We had a really fun to develop the Defender Challenge cars -- this will be an entertaining championship. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> In addition, there is a training and Testtag in Defender Challenge in February and the option to participate in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new horror story for independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time, we warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a gesicherte with barbed wire border of Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> In fact, in the Strathclyde document on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this is -- predictably -- played no role in the news. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Nobody has also mentioned that the EU Member States often bent their strict rules when it is convenient for them. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> However, Scotland is not part of the Schengen area, the continued failure to Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> So, no story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And one that has been so in the years that they have a fossil: the first time I heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; duck at least 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> This is an interesting point in the permanent Wiederholen of this ancient history. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should we expect an independent Scotland that after the European pipe dances? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why the London eintauschen against the yoke of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> That is the real European news: the big, broader plan to reunify Europe after the war is stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the euro crisis is the European project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> The anti-EU parties are gaining ground everywhere in the EU or the euro as single currency want to throw overboard. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, only founded this year -- nearly five million votes in the general election in September for ergattern and effectively the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There have been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> However, the current economic crisis is a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket, the national economy by adhering to the single currency to Europe, many people are of the opinion that the project is too far. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits -- that was only the case in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead, the Eurosystem has festgenagelt its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters -- and German politicians would like. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency found southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The only possibility is to reduce wages and public spending -- spurred by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Behind the current budget and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a result of the &quot;green&quot; energy directives imposed by Brussels -- a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, the European industry compared with the United States pays double for electricity and four for gas. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All wage fixing the world to protect the European petrochemical industry from cheap American shale gas in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> As a result, a revolt, particularly in France, the former cheerleaders of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war, France&apos;s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to Germany to keep in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But Berlin and Paris no longer needed as a gateway to political legitimacy struggling aufgedrückt, the ailing French economy, Europe has its own economic policy. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive Nachwahl and that the ruling Socialists at three. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote -- a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right-wing would mean benefits for the left. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What makes Le Pen with their newly gained popularity among white working-class people? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> They would like to use the European elections next year, to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections -- and this is perfectly possible, then such a block dominated by the European Parliament for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point that I want to emphasise that, in the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency on the abolition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but it will be something like the &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations,&quot; the General de Gaulle favored. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Germany and some of its satellite economies, perhaps the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Britain distanced themselves from this project in the hope to curry favor with the US. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> However, Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where is Scotland in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can decide to be a small region by (ultimately) England. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economic interests, including, Berlin and Brussels to say what they where stuck. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I suspect that Scotland could drive in a lockereren European network very well, if we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries is in a Europe of Nations not föderierten easier. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise, we should consider it join Norway and retain our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The SNP government in Scotland is -- remarkably -- the most successful political movement against austerity measures in Europe and a spectacular majority in 2011 as a result of the rejection of the proposed (and won) cuts, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> It would be ridiculous to decide now for independence for Scotland, only to get a austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone conversations) </seg>
<seg id="1708"> From takeoff to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and the image of films, but not with mobile phones, the new guidelines, issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> But the passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How quickly they were implemented, would depend on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The FAA, the airlines must prove that they comply with the new directives and that the training manuals of the flight crew and planes have updated the rules for the Verstauen equipment under the new rules. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA said it received a number of airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Under these airlines, Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> &quot;Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA announced in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Passengers currently have smartphones, tablets and other devices off, when the plane doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> They must restart only when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Passengers must enter the approach you again and they must not restart before the plane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Under the new guidelines could allow airlines whose aircraft against electronic disturbances are secured their passengers to use the devices in starting and landing on the tarmac, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Most new transport aircraft and other planes, which were umgerüstet, should meet the criteria for the use of Wi-Fi in greater heights. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, president of the association of professional cabin crew, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> &quot;If the new regulation is implemented safely, and we are working closely with the airline on this, both sides will benefit,&quot; said Glading. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> We are frankly tired, to feel as Aufpasser on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> However, Internet surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading of data, banned under three kilometres to the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Passengers are invited to smartphones, tablets and other devices in the air mode. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> So there is still no&quot;words With Friends, the Scrabble ähnelnde online game, played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of high profile American Airlines because he refused to shut down the device, while the aircraft was parked Flugsteig. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA highlights may ban on certain electronic devices for starting and landing </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Last month, said Mark Rosenker of Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national security issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Mobile phones are a problem, not only because it could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air Sendemasten can interfere,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government permit a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on the use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire Mccaskill from Missouri take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> There is talk in some studies, up to a third of the passengers the closure of the device forgotten or ignored. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers mitgeführte FM radios became known, then the trend represents the latest technology. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New planes are more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to electronic interference. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines offer passengers Wi-Fi some years ago, when the flight height is reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The Wi-Fi systems adapted pilots are also less susceptible to interference. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The vast majority of passenger planes should be appropriate for the greater use of electronic devices to the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Today&apos;s electronic devices in general much less radio radiation than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E-Reader, for example, only minimal radiation, if you umblättert. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> But when downloading or sending of data transfer values are more. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> One of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> In 2011 companies invited staff of Kindle E-Reader and a passenger plane made a Testflug, in order to identify problems, but could not see. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings with regard to the risk of the use of equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he was of the opinion that the passengers disrupted by the equipment is genuine, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other committee members said, there are only isolated reports of pilots for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots instruments landing in low visibility the closure of the devices by the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing them as a reasonable accommodation for travellers, today extensively equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA acknowledges that a passenger experience is not contrary to the security,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: no absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want to involve the residents in the planning,&quot; mayor Jens Häussler opened the public information event on flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Around 80 participants in the town hall, in order to explain the planned actions, questions, concerns and ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Häussler made it clear: &quot;the ultimate decisions of the members of the Council.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The Hochwasser Gechingen on May 15, 2009, have been caught unprepared, is a einschneidendes event, which raised the question of protection for the future, Häussler. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river survey was commissioned with the neighbouring village of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection scheme in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;The protection of maximum number of cultivated land is the goal,&quot; says Häussler. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> The planning is based on the expected flood protection according to the German weather service statistics every 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The climate change will be taken into account through a 15% supplement. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> In expert circles, with &quot;HQ 100aklima.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The water, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, with a 1000-year flood. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,&quot; says Häussler. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aklima Gechingen must be invested around EUR four million, the municipality can count on country grants amounting to around 70 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Häussler, but pointed out that the promotion is only when an overall concept. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This is the community dependent on the participation of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> A aufwändiges planning and authorisation procedures must be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> In the best case could be 2016 started with the implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Among other things, the protection scheme, which has already been presented in the council last week (we reported) local measures in the flow of Flüsschens Award from Stammheimer valley. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Following the presentation of the flood protection concept took the participants the opportunity to present their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Among other things, called into question, why are not more dams and reservoirs to protect the site. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregor Kühn, specialist planners from the engineering responsible forest and Corbe home, presented the concept, stressed that the interaction of all the measures needed in order to achieve the desired objective in the sum. </seg>

<seg id="1818"> The problem is in the administration and the first steps have been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Häussler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for channel systems other than for flood protection and this should not be mixed. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The community was obliged to interpret the channel network so that two-to three-year rain events verkraftet. </seg>

<seg id="1826"> In the case of the visit of the cafés on Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight distance to university Rhine-Waal is not in the pure sense of a déjà vu. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Finally, the cafe with the beautiful name exactly the aim: to make a real stay not only gedanklich, but hand always wiederkehrend experience. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Because it&apos;s fun and simply beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A look into the interior at the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> The modern, but not cool cafe environment looks like a place to relax. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> Here, the team with the Gründern Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with different types of coffee or cocktail. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> It&apos;s delicious cakes or individually-sourced fresh baguettes. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the schmucken cafés on Opschlag as art: in Kranenburg, the &quot;Art Lounge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The move to Kleve on Opschlag hope the Café lovers more sympathetic audience. </seg>

<seg id="1836"> &quot;And we do not have a specific target,&quot; said Daniel Büttner. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> We would like to raise the two young students here just as seniors and all ages in between. </seg>

<seg id="1848"> &quot;Beautiful, successful and funny,&quot; the two 33-year-olds. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> But not Jedermanns. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Perhaps Daniel Büttner is therefore not a ausgesprochener fan of event evenings: &quot;it&apos;s now not all right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> And I always speak with an event only, which is also interested in the special event. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of major orders over seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> It is between leading aircraft manufacturers to a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Air Show this month. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The dispute revolves around the seat width, offered the passengers on long flights in economy class -- not always those who seek most airlines, but this area is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a minimum seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says airlines should decide. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The debate comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer competing to sell more versions of their zweimotorigen long-haul flights, and from 17 to 21 November record orders at the event. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> As the rear of the aircraft is developed, particularly if there are rows with nine or ten seats, is crucial for the economic results, the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; design intended to provide. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing claims its modernised &quot;777X&quot; fasse 406 passenger seats in economy class, about 17 inches wide and so allow 10 per number. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus said that the competing version of the A 350 implies 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class, there are nine per number. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Plane giants often share Hiebe on technical details by advertising in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Now appelliert Airbus before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to make the race, with over 100 orders directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The company recently presented a display before the beginning of a new war could sit and donors showed a picture in which three people squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;would you accept that?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;Boeing proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional Turbo Props,&quot; says Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Given changed eating habits, people are thick, but not plane seats have changed radically. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male has increased by 10% between 40 and 49 years, according to data from the US Department of Health. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The average waist size of the male Amerikaners in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, was narrower than the average body size of the newly christened &quot;Jet Set.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Airbus, that we have carried out research which showed that one additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat, sleep quality by 53% increase. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to the seat and says that it is not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines the balance between air fares and furnishings. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The company also explains, according to research the experience in aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> &quot;It really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful,&quot; says the flight of Boeing&apos;s cabin expert Kent Craver. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> They do not want to dictate them, what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> They know their business better than anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers, it is more elbow for manufacturers, but it is increasingly an issue that can affect the sales. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The debate is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the US or Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficient per seat in its latest zweimotorigen long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> The Boeing&apos;s statements on the results depend partly on the 777X, with its ten seats per row, compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The increased per unit costs are still lower than currently used machines with 10 seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;Boeing quetscht more seats in his plane, to make it more competitive with our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, Airbus&apos; head of passenger comfort in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with 10 seats per number of the existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided to closer arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;Eighteen inches seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is, from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer from the threat,&quot; says Mary Kirby, controlled by the 777 expert for cabin, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which airlines can select. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Jet sellers have even band of travelling the world, to the establishment of competition nachzumessen. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they offer all the comfort anpreisen, manufacturers jets with high verdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> An Airbus A 350 with 10-seat rows, but say has not yet sold. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently, aircraft stressed the importance of more Anpassbarkeit of cabins and for some wide seats in the corridors. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets will probably fizzle, but experts say that the call for a new industry standard by the wave of 777X could divert sales. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> The Veganismus is according to Lexika Vegetarismus, but differs from this in a very significant way. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Although, the consumption of Sahnetorte, ice or a Edam, a Veganers, these feasts are not on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> The vegan milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish from all consumption of animal products-including honey is denied. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> What, you may ask, but a closer look at the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Brotaufstriche are very popular,&quot; says Ute Henkel, the owner of the reform House, a wide range of special products for vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Reuben Proctor also visited the shop in the city street. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> He lived for 13 years, the native Neuseeländer vegan in Lampertheim is (almost) everything, my food and what it needs to life. &quot;1997, I became a vegetarian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1903"> At the turn of the century came the next step and I was vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the normal leather shoe choice,&quot; says Proctor, the art vorzieht. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> He realized that there is in other everyday matters without animal products. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> First and foremost, be vegan is a ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I do not want animals for me to die,&quot; says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumption. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears behind herzutrauern, have the vegans quickly discover new products, the enthusiasm increased. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;There is a double bonus,&quot; Proctor says, &quot;indeed, no surrender, no be vegan asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; the assumption that the food conversion selection of dining options reduziere, Proctor more on the power of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> And these conditions, even some well-intentioned attempt fail. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The addiction factor is a very important factor that leaves many swiftly abandon, like smoking,&quot; Proctor a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> And is a &quot;certain tastes are not on the animal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Often it is the spices or the type of preparation, the taste. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;But we can also produce the same effect in other ways,&quot; verdeutlicht the vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> For example, a Grillfest Proctor aubergines, mushrooms and a few Vegan Würste. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> He respects on a balanced diets, it should even taste dishes. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Of course, we want to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It is a taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Health to eating disorders, a more widespread assumption that he had not suffered. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> For me, the conversion has had a positive aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I am not foreign cholesterol and have a high vitamin content. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high-performance athletes, the exclusively vegan diets. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;My blood values are well, I often check,&quot; he Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn the lack of vitamin B 12. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;As animals fed with feed, instead of pasture to graze in the meat that you buy in the freezer, it is questionable whether the amount of vitamin B 12 is high,&quot; Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For vegans, there is also the possibility to get the Coenzym in the form of tablets. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B 12 values are in order,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Long distances should not Proctor for food procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Finally, there are staple foods and every Super market has soya milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Everything I need, I find on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Only now and I buy something. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known for&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1933"> In any case, the veganer recipes much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;There is a lot to discover in the restaurant, with a few small Kniffen can be good, if not better results,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, baking powder and more carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor and his parents-in-law. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Family celebrations gives the vegan a new Würze. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This dynamic, if boiling, has a new value. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations that may arise, are as different as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Of course, he was also expressed scepticism. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> My food tastes you no longer? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> &quot;Should I feel bad because I drink milk?&quot; act with sensitivity in such issues should be as vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I do not reject the people, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor no enclave lives. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And then looked at the everyday world appears not as vegan alien as suspects and the vegans not as restricted as is commonly believed in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Fast food is allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Chips are everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many Kebab stores offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; Proctor says. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> In a pizzeria, he ordered on pasta or a pizza without cheese, it is a question of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The restaurants are so slowly it. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> &quot;When I started 13 years ago, I was vegan to feed, everything much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealanders identify a development: &quot;you must talk to the people, they can draw attention to this.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1954"> Everyone can eat, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive. </seg>

<seg id="1972"> New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure smoking </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Further tests are needed before testing on humans, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market, but had discovered that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; says Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus selective the liver cells, which produce a constant stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibody hunt and neutralize the nicotine molecules in the blood, before they reach the brain, which a smoker no nicotine high. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In experiments behielten vaccinated mice, which have been fed Nikotin, their normal level of activity. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Mice without vaccination, by contrast, had a &quot;break,&quot; the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine reached their brains. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contain antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The vaccination had to maintain the anti-body so often that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> But the costs of the new vaccine are likely to significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in anti-body factories. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he certainly children, before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;They know they feel: when they start to smoke again, no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to the habit,&quot; he explained. </seg>

<seg id="2029"> Frontier Airlines collects charges for hand luggage </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 of verstauen on their flight hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Frontier Airlines intends to charge $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if read in the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> The new charge applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment on the seat, small bags under the seat remain free. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Frontier berechne stated that, if the fee shall be paid in advance, $25 and $100 for travelers who paid only on Flugsteig. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&apos;Malley said the fee of $100, which aims to move travellers in the run-up to the payment. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> &quot;We do not want to calculate this amount,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> Airlines began to demand for the first and second checked bag fees in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> Passengers who tried to bypass have therefore plugged into hand luggage as much as possible, which means that the baggage compartments above the seats are often crowded. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Fees are a way to persuade passengers, less on board. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> O&apos;Malley said the new fee is not really about money. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> The most loyal customers of Frontier, have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist on the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website, do not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> This means that a passenger on the flight climb of Frontier circumstances can take a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar bag. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O&apos;Malley said Frontier&apos;s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers are informed about the fee, before they come to Flugsteig. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The new Handgepäck fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, there is not a precise date. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers often calling on baggage fees and other charges, but airlines resort to. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> They argue that the cost of baggage money and passengers should pay this service, if they wanted it. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Many on Wall Street view the new luggage fees as a sign that the airlines enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> The most so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago first demanded and also followed Allegiant Air, a low-cost airlines for baggage charges. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, said the additional charges closely. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> He estimated in a report in December 2011, that the Handgepäck fee Spirit einbringe USD 50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what he would expect Flugsteig, when passengers were faced with the unusual Handgepäck fee of the company. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> &quot;The boarding process is one of the most smoothly, which I have seen in my career in the aviation,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> I expected to see gnashing and handgreifliche discussions on Flugsteig. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> &quot;The plane was full,&quot; he said, &quot;and the boarding ran as lubricated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Frontier is Spirit in the $2, the demand for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, kept the whole box and coffee gratis will recall. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Water is still free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> Us Airways 2008 kurzzeitig attempted to demand money for soft drinks, but this was back seven months later, after passengers had complained and no major society nachgezogen. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Frontiers step to levy charges for hand luggage, if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative, with the customers on the website. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to $25 per ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> This provides an incentive for all societies, passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Frontier is in this area, however, has gone furthest. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> In September, the company started booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25% of the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> A third flight booked with Frontier over 1,000 miles brings customers only 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Passengers can also exclusively reserve the direct purchase on the website of Frontier jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Frontier has a loyal customer base of his seat in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> The revenue declined 9 percent and the flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as we read in the financial report is published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.. </seg>

<seg id="2160"> A jury composed of representatives of Black Forest messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects all the entries three wishes. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> What are the conditions for participation? </seg>
<seg id="2162"> The construction material should be done in the value of a maximum of EUR 2000 and a day (action) to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> In addition, the winner must for many hardworking construction workers. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> What with the day and the Helfern? </seg>
<seg id="2165"> Bauhaus, with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb the material. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> It is delivered on the agreed day in the nursery and will be processed directly by the workers. </seg>

<seg id="2171"> The Palmer United Party could monitor up to four votes in the Senate, which is important for the decision, whether withdrawn or cut back the carbon and mining taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> &quot;He is in a huge conflict of interest, when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest, whether they leave or not,&quot; Palmer said. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> ESA determines large space missions: missions for billions </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes experts of the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 proposals were to selection, five are still in the race. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> More than 1,000 planets of other stars, astronomers have already found. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> If there is at least some of them life, nobody knows. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The choice is difficult: we should search for gravitational waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Or explore the origins of the cosmos? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Or after discovering erdähnlichen planets fahnden and perhaps alien life? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> These questions are the responsibility of the European space agency Esa. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For its program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; looking for ideas for two major space projects, which promote the research. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such &quot;l mission&quot; is approximately EUR 1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> At the beginning of September, the European space research, the elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were debated, five of them are now in the shortlist. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> A number of bodies on the proposals, hooks the researchers. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific programme committee. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Four major issues, the Esa has selected the mission of the 2007 initiierten programme &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; answers. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds and the formation of planets that orbit stars-are still in the proverbial dark. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can live there? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> To pursue this issue, &quot;his&quot; space telescope to 2017, with 500 already known planetary systems in our surroundings be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But the possibilities are limited, his is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With larger instruments could Astronomen erdähnliche planets and even the composition of atmospheres and search for &quot;Biomarkern&quot; as an indicator for biological activity: gases. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> This question is ultimately about what are the conditions for the emergence of life. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> An important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation posed by him with the planetary system. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In our solar system, these transactions exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> The Solar Orbiter&quot;the Esa has already sent a mission of the M-class (there, the budget is around half a billion euros) for this issue. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe will start 2017 and surface and activity of the sun closely. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> They want to find out what role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> This is the, the first of the three L-mission of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; programme. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins its journey expected to 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Eight years later, she reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa, Ganymede and KALLISTO. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Perhaps there are derogations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> What is the universe, and what is it? </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Our universe in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> In addition to the us geläufigen from the stars, planets and life as we know, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, by actions to accelerate the expansion of space. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws valid in the first a split second of Urknalls were what dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> &quot;Euclid,&quot; the Esa has already approved a M mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> With a special telescope to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could make the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Many experts believe the best chances of approval as L-mission &quot;e-lisa,&quot; an ambitious approach for the detection of gravitational waves. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Physicists are changes in the structure of space-time, the Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> They have not yet been proven. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could create, the scientists behind the project hope. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission provides a detector, stationed in the space of two or three probes. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It could also prove gravitational waves, unlike plants on the earth, the Big Bang, and new knowledge about the formation of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Four other competing proposals to the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope, called &quot;Athena,&quot; which, among other things, to explore black holes, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot; to identify and investigate erdähnliche planets. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Ausgeschieden already include proposals on samples returning from the Moon, Venus and Mars, to explore asteroids and the solar physics. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools </seg>
<seg id="2243"> On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a series of guidelines for the treatment of children with food allergies in schools. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> These are the first such directives issued by the US Government, as the number of school children with food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The guidelines contain information for schools, the faculty and staff to raise awareness about food allergies and how to deal with children who show an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> It is also recommended that schools have stock Epinephrin -- the car injection of the Epipen brand is most commonly used, in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can hold Epinephrin easier. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The report also contains a list of typical symptoms, the children, have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Children may say: &quot;it feels as if something on my tongue,&quot; is my tongue feels as if a hair is&quot;or &quot;my tongue kribbelt.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2258"> Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, which includes the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to Ruby receiving and the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> They were desperately searching for their missing dog and Hilferufe in social networks, when she was following the small road accident in the quarry crowd. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Some saw a Spaziergänger about 2:15 on Wednesday, said his dog, Ruby stranded on the 15 metre) in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The technical rescue team rushed to the Cleckheaton Fire Station and seilte to rescue Ruby, who then was transported in a Hundebox upwards. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Andy Clayton, a specialist technical rescue team, said: &quot;It was in a dangerous situation. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> It was in the middle of the temple -- 15 metres from the top and the bottom. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> They moved no muscle during their rescue -- it was as stiff frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> But now it is good. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Then she has eaten a few dogs cake. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> This was a very unusual use. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Peter Lau, a specialist technical rescue teams, said: &quot;Ruby had a huge fortune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2270"> There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> Ruby was brought to the vet to investigate, but found nothing more than exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;in the rescue was watching frightening.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2273"> I could not believe that it was really up there. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The vet said that if the exhaustion become too large and they collapsed, it would probably abgestürzt. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The firefighters have done a splendid job. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> It was really courageous, what they have done. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> We are so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Scott Alderson from Keighley added: &quot;we were afraid that it would fall, but they remained up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2280"> The firefighters were great. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> I can hardly believe, where it was. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> U.S. border: &quot;Super&quot; for drug smuggling tunnel discovered </seg>
<seg id="2283"> On the border between Mexico and the US investigators have discovered a &quot;super tunnel&quot; for drug smuggling and shut down. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> As the US customs authorities, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, rail and air-conditioning. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Three suspects were arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and confiscated nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The tunnel was according to the data, not yet in use. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> &quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they can ride roughshod under the radar by digging,&quot; said the general prosecutor of the US Distrikts Southern California, Laura Duffy, in a press conference in a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Addressing the drug gangs assured Duffy: &quot;if you continue to build tunnels and tried to use it, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a perpetual fight against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Since 2006, in Mexico, more than 77,000 people have been killed in connection with the drug crime. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Designed by experts </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Because of the budget of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> The track layout was so equipped that electrically powered cars could be used. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> On the Mexican side, the access in a building that is 80 metres away from the border. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> According to authorities, a head 20 metres in the depth of the tunnel entrance. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 cm width. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> It would have been appropriate to promote the illegal immigration to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine Fund. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The third, a Mexican, was because of the confiscated marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Since 2006 were eight such tunnels have been discovered, said at the press conference in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> But it is the first time that such a Tunnelbau cocaine was found. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Normally, smuggled cocaine in small quantities and not through tunnels. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This show the &quot;despair&quot; of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the Fahndung DEA in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> They would do everything to get in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> The detainees were given no details, at least one Mexicans, they said. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> They must face imprisonment of up to ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Obama&apos;s Rückzieher in the health policy </seg>
<seg id="2309"> After intense criticism backtracking President Obama yesterday in his oft-repeated promise is clear: &quot;if you like your health insurance, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2310"> After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a termination letter, the Republican president in the last few days, he had misled the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Yesterday Obama puts his original promise. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> &quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, they can keep,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> In response to the numerous media reports on the Kündigungen Obama called for those Americans who have received such communications, to look for a new insurance on the open market. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Most citizens could thus receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;They are a better offer,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The government called it a little surprising that the 5% of the population have insurance to look for another fare, as the Treaty does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act entspreche. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;I would like to say very directly to these Americans: You deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform since October was &quot;pathetic.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2319"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I am determined to regain your trust. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> This is a raised Sebelius to a sitting behind yesterday&apos;s hearing in the House of Representatives consultant was taken after a dispute with Republican legislators Billy Long of Missouri. it was whether they should be obliged to participate in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> After more than three hours hearing being Long Sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act have not voluntarily renounced a state-sponsored insurance to a collective complete with HealthCare.gov, it now wants to sell millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Parents of sexual children can choose &quot;sex unbestimmt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Babies will no longer be rigid male or female zugewiesen. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Under the new law, parents must explain no sex for such children, but &quot;vague&quot; or &quot;not fixed&quot; on the birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents, so that they must make no hasty decisions on operations for a gender allocation in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of sexual people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> An inter-sexual person, according to the BBC years later said: &quot;I am neither man nor woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I remain the Flickwerk, created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year either a boy or a girl to the world. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> They belong to the Inter Sexuellen, a group covered by the diagnosis &quot;sex differentiation disorder&quot; (DSD), a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes, Keimdrüsen (Eierstöcken or testes), or unusually developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was perhaps inter-sexually. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest that we should use the best available information on sex allocation, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide -- if any -- for a operation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;blade for a good cause.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Inter sexual children constitute an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but not for most of the children,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> You can make a sex allocation without operation and then wait to see how the identity entwickle. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data on, as a child his gender identity, are not very developed. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> No one knows why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It is like the secret, why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report to the European Commission in 2011, to distinguish Inter people are transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological condition, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both or not clearly defined as one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These properties were in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair and genitals, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as Fortpflanzung bodies or Chromosom structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, inter-sexual and transgender people face in professional life and on the extent of harassment, violence, prejudice and crime. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Not consistent with the gender image boys now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; on official documents. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> In June Australier Norrie May-Welby (52), recognised as the world&apos;s first &quot;sex lose&quot; person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of &quot;undefined&quot; gender status. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> German Ausweise in M and W will have a third allocation, X for inter-sexually, the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, a news story on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The US site Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, with the explanatory statement: &quot;if the world dragged into a new state, where the gender, sexual activity but it is not a decision we verdrehen two other pillars of civilisation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone, it would be better if babies at the birth of a sex zugewiesen. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;The parents general is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; she said of the parents website. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts, called Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god of both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Ten years ago the medicine the sex as something that you can extinguish and then rebuild. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation angezweifelt, now known as the gender identity is complex, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels the Aufwachsen with the sex assigned to them. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> &quot;In the middle of the twentieth century called it a psychiatric emergency,&quot; Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If a child was born, then it is not the psychiatrists, but the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, took the view that gender is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives -- such as the parents of a child and a child -- acting with the genes and hormones, so consider whether a person is male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> But in a notorious under the title &quot;John/Joan&quot; case from 1966, his theories were controversial. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was separated in a botched circumcision, the child to kastrieren and to remove his testicles and raise it as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;Money presented the case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,&quot; says Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> The boy was about 15, he moved back to the male and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> With 38 but he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practise this model. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries came to the public, are &quot;not happy with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2368"> For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, was born with male XY chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The doctors were not aware whether he had a great Klitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfactory life &quot;as a man.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2370"> So were its external body and testicles surgically removed in 1976 and shortly after the birth he was brought up as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> At the age of 12 he received female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> &quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he said to ABCNews.com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What he found was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilised in my birth -- and no one has ever said that to me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD, his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> The operation, it has become infertile. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today he fights for others in an organisation called Interface Project that inter-sexual people are perceived as normal. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California -based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German legislation &quot;to encourage Abstempeln and Stigmatisieren.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2383"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to define&apos;,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We are afraid that the interventions. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think that it would be better to wait for the male or female zuzuweisen and then. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> But we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar-Mattis said her organization support the Australian law, because it allows adults recognition as a third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2388"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> The German law relates to the allocation of childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> This is not a fight to the small children should force at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> When they grow up, they can decide on their body. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast Radiologin from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation and hundreds of others in a self-help support group, says that the German law &quot;assigns&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the Rezeptor Defektes the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Katie is now 29 and married; it works in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania as a collaborator. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> She is infertile, but hopes to get through adoption or a surrogate child. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;The law gives parents, which they do not rush decisions,&quot; Baratz said. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this way, everything is in order -- you draw the child large and loves. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> It has a wonderful baby and the parents happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And we must not rush to an operation, which will no longer be reversed. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;This includes the children in the decision-making and remove the fear the parents umtreibt, because they are of the opinion that they are not doing the right thing,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Finally, the child decides the sex, the better with him, and that is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> This children are in a position to make the decision itself. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellent the fight. </seg>

<seg id="2412"> If Janson Santiago is tired of life gebeugt on the chair is real. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> In addition, the role of the old fisherman a character through and through, Janson excellent meistert. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Hemingway told the story of a wrestler, a courageous man who does not abandon and ultimately by his knowledge and also his willpower to win the fight against the fish. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Janson is in many respects as Darsteller alone on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> It is to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues are no boring. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> His efforts to draw the fish up to the surface of the water, are so real that only the viewers forget that the sea of blue illuminated water bottles. </seg>

<seg id="2427"> Charlie, founder of &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious ice cream company,&quot; says: &quot;the product is unbelievable, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of this for GBP 200.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> If the mouth of the protein erwärmt, increasing the pH and the ice. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> We have tested in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful Leucht effect. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced, because the jellyfish Leuchtstoff is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Each bullet costs me about GBP 140. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> But it tastes delicious. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Charlie&apos;s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> But his latest creation will be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> He says: &quot;I would like to develop an invisible Eiscreme.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> It is to be impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals, ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to create it. </seg>

<seg id="2507"> The throwaway society is not </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The night was long, the music loud and the mood is good, but it is home. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> However, in the bellies of the people on the front and rear seat is the hunger. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> Of course, this may be responsible for a cocktail or champagne. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> What is more, as gechillt go to the next Drive-In, to take a bite? </seg>
<seg id="2512"> I admit that I am pleased, when it comes to fast-food Holen late at night or early morning. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> A few chips, a Coke, a Burger and then nothing like home and to bed. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gamers. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> What must a lack that steter Regelmässigkeit raises its fast-food bags from the car window? </seg>
<seg id="2516"> In particular, the weekends weggeworfene paper bags on road edges and parking. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> &quot;Why?&quot; question. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The people are too dim to take the bags home) until the next garbage? </seg>
<seg id="2519"> It is not just that the paper Zeugs the landscape verschandelt. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Bags have also covered transport facilities as barriers and caused by accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> So what does this &quot;throwaway society&quot; but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If you travel often, especially with several people in the car, you know, like a Rückbank nights can be celebrated, clothes, bottles and other rubbish are. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> A few bags would represent more or less but nix food scraps in contrast to the road, where no other rum trampeln. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> I can already see the day when the areas to the cities and communities require for their bags Pfand blöd and the fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Milk and egg alternatives in the overview </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Mashed tofu with plantation cream, for example, is a substitute for Quark. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Further calls the vegetarian Federal the world Vegantag on November 1. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The vegetarian Federal Germany proposes on the occasion of the World Vegantags on November 1, a number of vegan alternatives: </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to replace butter, yogurt, soy yogurt. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Instead of milk, soya, oat, almond milk or rice can be used. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Premium Bare plantation cream ersetze traditional whipped cream. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Also, there are herbal alternatives. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Half a zerdrückte, maturity banana, for example, can replace an egg Bindemittel in a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> 50 grams Apfelmus or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water suitable for it. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Locker will instead of tinfoil egg, for example, with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons water. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can achieve this. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> According to the Vebu vegan, purely vegetable feed is now around 800,000 people in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> A black box in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2540"> American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, the dashboard each car place. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices record and the information to the authorities every kilometer, are at the heart of a controversial experiment of Washington and planning offices of the Federal States to revise the outdated system of financing American roads. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The usually dull field of road planning suddenly sparked a debate with colourful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertäre have allied with environmental groups and the government argue that the small boxes used for recording the kilometer -- and, perhaps, where they were driven, and can use the information for the calculation of tax notice. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and a number of data protection concerns. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But while in Congress cannot agree on a procedure, several states are waiting no longer. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> They are examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per driving mile. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> This is really a must for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;There is nothing that we only may use,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, a record of planning gefahrenen miles on all California motorists in the state by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The way in which we pay these taxes, will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology is there. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, default. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> But in America is no longer as much fuel as before. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars consume less petrol. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre), for 20 years has not increased. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians dare not with high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> &quot;The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> His state has recently 500 cars equipped with a tachograph, which tested a miles-based payment system. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;This is the best alternative in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> Not surprisingly, the idea finds resonance in urban liberals, for example, the tax could be reduced to use to influence the driving behaviour so that congestion and carbon emissions. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Californian designers rely on the system, enshrined in the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious objectives of the state of climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the best long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> The free marketers of the Reason Foundation, of the idea, drivers pay according to the distance travelled. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;This is not a tax, which disappears into a black hole,&quot; says Adrian Moore, vice president for directives at Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> The people pay directly for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, in a report in 2011, had asked the Congress to move towards miles-based billing. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million costly pilot project involving 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the Vorstoss and responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas, the everyday people who have many miles on the way to work or in the city. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving on their own in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> Oregon is currently involved 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment of the country anwirbt. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of mineral oil tax to the federal government. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York City is also considering such. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois testing it in limited with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The concept is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers with the equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue their every move. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> When the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;it would be relatively easy to the tachograph into outright monitoring equipment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada is one of a number of states who are now looking for affordable technology, the state can collect gefahrenen miles, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> So, Khan, would also reassure the public. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The company is not originally assumed to help states in the taxation of drivers. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Its aim was to get a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of gefahrenen miles. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> But the devices are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, are regularly uploaded via modem. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites go unrecorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> In some of these big mistakes were made public pilot programs. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon, planners are experimenting to give drivers a series of choice. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> You can choose for a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or you choose no device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all inhabitants of the State of gefahrenen miles. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Other authorities hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public, by providing the equipment with more functions than with less. </seg>

<seg id="2658"> RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement, which was supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia, and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilise the country&apos;s independent government. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> After the peace treaty of 1992, it has become an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Analysts consider it unlikely that the country falls back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals. </seg>

<seg id="2846"> The Treasury has provisionally calculated, but still waiting for the final decision of the CGT action by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7 percent on homes that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers, the apartments as a company and not as individuals. </seg>

<seg id="2849"> &quot;But this step may make some foreign investors cautious, with regard to the purchase of real estate in London, or prevent owners to sell,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> First-class real estate -- the top five to ten percent of the housing market price -- in the wealthy south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased to the record of 11.8% last year. </seg>

<seg id="2872"> Report: Obama campaign considered to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2873"> President Barack Obama&apos;s closest advisers have secretly considered to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book, and she reported on Thursday evening that &quot;extensive group meetings and surveys carried out at the end of 2011,&quot; the president&apos;s top adviser for Obama&apos;s dwindling hopes of re-election, to see if it would look better if he let Biden. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book is thoroughly the history of the efforts of senior staff of the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it had on the poll, to replace the former Clinton against the vice president. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> The potential change was a secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Only half a dozen of the president&apos;s closest advisers -- including Daley, the former Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the change. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> In &quot;Double Down &quot;says that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden despite their&quot;close personal relationship ,&quot; before they finally decided against such a move, after the data showed that the candidacy of Clinton&apos;s&quot; would not significantly improve Obama&apos;s chances. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> &quot;I made a whole series of things that we should consider, and that was one of them,&quot; Daley told the magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll, so we thought: &quot;for God&apos;s sake, what do we do?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> While Daley described the investigation as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that, during the campaign for re-election had been considerable effort to determine whether such a move in the polls auszahle. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> &quot;In campaigns is not so much money spent on polls and focus groups, if you are not thinking seriously about something,&quot; Martin said on AC 360. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team on an exchange nachdachte. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley whether his former boss about the potential change had known. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Although Daley said he does not believe that the president was aware of the possible change ,&quot;&quot; the former chief of staff admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; liefere no definitive answer to the question of whether the political Sondierungen had reached Obama&apos;s desk. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Cooper asked Martin if he seriously think Obama knew nothing of the investigations on whether we should abandon Biden in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> &quot;Possible,&quot; said Martin. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Council is pleased that sound budget </seg>
<seg id="2892"> When it comes to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh in council meetings. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The village Säckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The financial year 2012 can also be entered as success in this sense. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> This was in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> As Andrea Roth mouth, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million over a million euros higher than planned. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> The surplus of the administrative budget is about EUR 1.8 million around a million euros on the approach. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> The surplus is mainly due to higher tax revenues and the share of the income tax. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> The capital budget was again clear on the planned values. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Instead of the EUR 1.5 million it was EUR 2.5 million last year. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;This is essentially due to the higher Zuführung from the administrative budget,&quot; Roth mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Since the financial year 2012 have been less investment than planned, the reserve Zuführung is higher. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> Overall, the general reserve of approximately EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Roth mouth and her team for their excellent work. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> &quot;This work not simply schüttelt from the sleeves,&quot; Gerster with a view to the annual accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> He and the local authorities were evident about the good figures. </seg>

<seg id="2909"> This, in turn, are often according to Gerster subsidies has been reduced from the country. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> For these grants from various compensation sticks, there are conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants, certain Hebesätze. </seg>

<seg id="2922"> The blockade policy entschuldige not the problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Obama&apos;s memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> I read a terribly sad book. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> It is a book of which I thought I would be dull during the second year of my medical studies aufheitern and give me hope again. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> It is called&apos; the Audacity to Win&quot; (to win) and the memoirs for President Barack Obama&apos;s 2008 election. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> When I&apos;m done with my patients transcripts in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and a speeches breathless. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> The election was held to a landslide victory and news spokesman, to consider the historical significance of this hour. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers, they could find. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> A team of young visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> When Obama went into office in 2008, he had approval rates of 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> And then I agree with the book. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Umzuschalten again gerissen at the present is a rude awakening, as if from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It is hard to remember this optimistic times, they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In the years since I first made my voice, indeed, something has changed. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But it is simply not what I imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I recognise the great and seitigen things, Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for medical insurance for military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced Verschweigens of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> I too am of the view that the political blocking tactics have tipped too many aspirations, which should be our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> But after I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends countless times, I end with my statement. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I have reached a point of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and punished whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It does not justify the results of a report, which means that the efforts of the White House to having the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And jüngstens cannot excuse the inability, in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to create a simple website. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I do not know whether this is what I would have expected. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> If I work with 18 should understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Obviously, the Members office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public debate. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be elected by the government itself. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> And what bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mitt Romney, a confusing and unausgegorene alternative, he seemed not to be able to determine its direction and positions. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would meet the hope which we had heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> But, with the sinking of the ratings below 45 percent for Obama this week is returning to the 2008 book to become even harder. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> It makes me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had a serious loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania einstecken. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> In a meeting with the election officials after the decision he said his staff, they would come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause. </seg>
