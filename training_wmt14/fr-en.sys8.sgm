<seg id="1"> The NSA case highlights the total absence of debate on intelligence </seg>
<seg id="2"> How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side is frustrated in public in summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and the other prohibits the overview of the territory by the Bolivian presidential jet, on the basis of the rumours of the presence on board of Edward Snowden? </seg>
<seg id="3"> In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> When Fran√ßois Hollande phone to Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius summoned the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance on all communications in France. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World in a few weeks apart from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the Quai d&apos;Orsay eavesdropping by the NSA? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Would it not as a wave of hypocrisy on your part? </seg>
<seg id="7"> The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allow every citizen to form an opinion. </seg>
<seg id="8"> When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we believe that, in view of American power, this is an important lighting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, this is in no way to be outraged at this practice is to describe the world as it is. </seg>
<seg id="10"> France has benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations against our interests? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can we deprive itself of American collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="12"> The establishment since roughly ten years of very powerful interception technological tools by the United States, but also by France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchanges of information almost daily, and are described by both sides as essential. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the ways of the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="15"> France may be driving, for example, to transmit the entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and, in return, as has already been said - quickly, Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So the question of substance behind the NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, that the issue of the total lack of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, the justification for such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the issue of attacks on freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="17"> What really threaten the United States? A deterioration of their image? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was beautiful denounce them, I don&apos;t see how they can be punished. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The risk faced by Americans may be twofold. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first is when their allies - and it has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest peak of their state, were monitored. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Another effect may be more economical to him: More and more South American or European companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data for American contractors subject to U.S. laws, and therefore in the grip of the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Last: The vast movement of revelations initiated by the world&apos;s media, which contributes to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services until then virtually non-existent, could push the legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given their intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Barack Obama receives the Iraqi prime minister, in the midst of violence </seg>
<seg id="25"> The US president was to receive Friday, November 1, 2013, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, seeking help from the United States to combat the largest wave of violence over the past five years. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Iraq has seen in October the deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures released Friday, November 1 by the Iraqi authorities. </seg>
<seg id="27"> 964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The United Nations provides an even higher with 979 1,902 deaths and injuries. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The violence are increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri al-Maliki, dominated by Shiites. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence fears of a new conflagration while neighboring Syria is in the throes of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Men are slaughtered in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, to power under Saddam Hussein, who complained of being marginalized politically and to be the target of unjust arrests, promoted this outbreak of violence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Nouri al-Maliki wants a &quot;global war&quot; against Al-Qaida. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The violence is at the center of the U.S. talks of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="39"> At the time, the US president, elected on a promise to put an end to the military engagement in the country, had painted a rosy picture of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri al-Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive and congressional officials. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On Thursday, he advocated that the international community is conducting a &quot;third world war&quot; against Al-Qaida. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The principle of greater assistance to Iraq&apos;s security is supported by influential Senate Republicans and Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="43"> But they have also criticized Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, giving partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &quot;sectarian and authoritarian politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="44"> They also demanded of Barack Obama that he will make it clear to Nouri al-Maliki that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="45"> The French police stop supporters of Anderlecht from other than with the coaches of RSCA </seg>
<seg id="46"> The French police decided to put strict rules on the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, wrote Marie Verbeke, the spokesman for the Brussels police zone afternoon, Friday. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The Belgian fans of RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League must use the travel system put in place by the RSCA. </seg>
<seg id="48"> &quot;The convoy of buses will be escorted by police from a former border post at Rekem until the MTP stage,&quot; transmitted the spokesperson. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The course will be the same for the return. </seg>
<seg id="50"> &quot;If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the prefecture of French police reported that measures have been taken to make arrests or police custody,&quot; said Marie Verbeke. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The Vatican probe on contraception, divorce and homosexuality </seg>
<seg id="52"> The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how the parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and couples of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The survey asked participants how priests are gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to obtain the greatest possible answers. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The information will be used for a major rally on the family that Pope Francis planned for next year. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="57"> A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the United States confirmed that the document was genuine and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe the parishioners. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the UK, the bishops have published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The 37-year-old man who has taken a child hostage in school Gabrielle Roy of Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Omar Mustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, uttering threats, carrying weapons for a purpose dangerous, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order. </seg>
<seg id="61"> &quot;The rapid response of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,&quot; said Corporal Bert Paquet by press release. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Omar Hassan is still in custody and will appear in court Friday. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking </seg>
<seg id="64"> Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that we take to smoke a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="65"> A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect life mice of nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Further tests are needed before starting the tests on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the early signs were encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="67"> &quot;We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all methods now available on the market, but are discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,&quot; said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="68"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to develop anti-nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The virus infects selectively liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The antibodies track all nicotine molecules present in the bloodstream and neutralize before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have her dose of nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="71"> During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine then continued their normal activity. </seg>
<seg id="72"> But the mice that were not vaccinated were eased, &quot;said the researchers, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The previous tobacco vaccines have proved ineffective because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="75"> The injections were to be repeated so often that the antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="76"> But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells in factories in antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, we could administer it to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="78"> But it is more likely that it would be used by smokers who want to quit. </seg>
<seg id="79"> &quot;They know that if they start to smoke, they will take no pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habit,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="80"> British scientists have said that the results were interesting but reported that much more thorough searches were necessary. </seg>
<seg id="81"> The Egyptian Islamists in the streets to denounce the trial of Morsi </seg>
<seg id="82"> Tempers are rising in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Two days before the opening of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets. </seg>
<seg id="84"> A mobilization throughout Egypt calling for the restoration of the country&apos;s first democratically elected president. </seg>
<seg id="85"> This is not a trial underscores the Muslim Brotherhood activist. </seg>
<seg id="86"> So far no lawyer was able to meet him and no voluntary was unable to take a copy of the documents of the case. </seg>
<seg id="87"> This is not a trial, it is a farce. </seg>
<seg id="88"> The trial of President Morsi is a fake trial rebelled a pro-Morsi, who is supposed to be judging Sisi, not the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Sisi is a liar and a traitor. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Clashes erupted in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="92"> On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the police academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged. </seg>
<seg id="93"> A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d&apos;Oise </seg>
<seg id="94"> The authorities announced Thursday, October 31 that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d&apos;Oise, clearly foreign while France is free of indigenous cases since 2001. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and he died on October 28. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute. </seg>
<seg id="97"> &quot;An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of the people who might have come into contact with the kitten between October 8 and October 28 included,&quot; says the ministries of health and agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="98"> &quot;Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified&quot; and received a preventive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> &quot;In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective,&quot; said the press release. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Departments now require people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or lashed mucous membranes or skin harmed by the kitten or the animal would have been in contact with the kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. on 1 November. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;France is rabies-free since 2001, the kitten or mother were imported from another country, not unscathed,&quot; according to the news release. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The Department of Agriculture said that the last &quot;indigenous&quot; cases of rabies identified dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that &quot;France is officially declared free of the disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="103"> A case of rabies in a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="104"> &quot;Rabies is a fatal disease if it is not treated in time,&quot; recalls the ministries and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The portico of Pont-de-Buis dismantled </seg>
<seg id="106"> The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which took place Saturday, a violent demonstration by opponents of the tax, was dismantled on Thursday morning. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Of the cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and domestic traffic was diverted in the aftermath. </seg>
<seg id="108"> The decision of dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finist√®re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico. </seg>
<seg id="109"> This is the last of the three porticoes ecotax functioning in the department of Finist√®re, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged. </seg>
<seg id="110"> An Australian woman appealed his prison sentence in Thailand </seg>
<seg id="111"> A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for having wrongly claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the sentence and was released on bail. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a court of Phuket Province on June 15 false statements after Thai police said that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who mastered, was attacked early on Sunday, June 10. </seg>
<seg id="113"> However, the video surveillance recordings were later revealed that she had returned to his hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admits to having invented the story. </seg>
<seg id="115"> She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Bamford was sentenced to a prison sentence of 15 days in a low-security detention centre in the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a prison for women. </seg>
<seg id="117"> This is the daughter of the former player of the Australian Rugby League Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; for the welfare of her daughter and wanted her returned to Australia. </seg>
<seg id="119"> &quot;We obviously had a scary moment, but we hope to take her home safely as soon as possible,&quot; said Tunks. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Bamford appealed the sentence and was released after the payment of a deposit of 50,000 baht. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on holiday in the area of Krabi, south of Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and a detention in an adult prison. </seg>
<seg id="123"> However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to improve its image deteriorated with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings for Nortel patents </seg>
<seg id="125"> The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents started an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company he has donned the pole at the auction of patents that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the Assize Court of the United States in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Google is accused of raping seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Patents contain technologies that allow to display an advertisement in connection with Internet search terms, said the findings of the trial, which is the core business of Google. </seg>
<seg id="130"> It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that run on Google&apos;s Android operating system, which delivers a fierce competition for mobile products, Apple and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In 2011, Google has made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Google has increased its offer several times, and finally propose $4.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="134"> After losing the Nortel patents deal with Rockstar, Google has subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on the library of Motorola&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="135"> &quot;Although having failed in its attempt to acquire patents at issue in the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate patents,&quot; said the outcome of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Rockstar calls for greater damages against Google, as he claimed that the patent violation of Google is stubborn, according to the complainant. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="138"> The former Labour minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the anti-corruption regulator of the state. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the area controlled by the government. </seg>
<seg id="140"> On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to renew their leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and a cafe, after their expiration in August 2005, but there has been bidding. </seg>
<seg id="141"> She now investigation into allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of the secret of Mr Obeid interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="142"> During the years of discussions initiated in 2005, the government has pushed for the leases are tender. </seg>
<seg id="143"> The tenants were against and also wanted to longer terms. </seg>
<seg id="144"> In 2009, the leases on the companies from Circular Quay, which related to the Obeid about $2.5 million per year, were renewed without there being tendering. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders. </seg>
<seg id="146"> But he denied having changed its policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, called for a change of government policy in terms of leases. </seg>
<seg id="147"> The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed the calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid at the Department of Fisheries. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the policy on the commercial leases?&quot; Asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;No,&quot; replied Mr Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I don&apos;t remember what we discussed, but in any case, it was not that. </seg>
<seg id="151"> In any case, certainly not between me and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="152"> FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not spend a call with their mobile phone) </seg>
<seg id="153"> The airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their mobile phone - under the much anticipated new guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="154"> But passengers should not expect immediate changes. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, &quot;said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes comply with the new guidelines and that they updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules concerning the storage devices to be in compliance. </seg>
<seg id="157"> The FAA said it had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;In terms of the plan, we could approve a wider use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane&apos;s doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="161"> They are not supposed to reignite them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and that the commander gave the green light. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices during the descent of the plane before landing and not restart until the plane is raised. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes are properly protected electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings and rolling on the ground, said the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Most of the new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, was pleased by these changes. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Once the new policy implementation safely - and we will work closely with the carriers for this - it will be beneficial to everyone,&quot; Glading said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="167"> We are frankly tired of us feel as &quot;supervisors&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="168"> But there will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchanging emails and text messages or downloading data below 10,000 feet, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So still no Words With Friends, the online game played Scrabble style to which the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was deported on an American Airlines flight after he refused to turn off his camera while the aircraft was parked at the door. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And the heavier devices such as laptops will always be stored because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The regulatory authority on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="175"> Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Safety expert on CBS News, said that the phones were still considered to pose a risk. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with the navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, they could disrupt the mobile phone masts if they are used on board,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="177"> An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="178"> The pressure on the FAA has strengthened in recent years to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these prohibitions. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Some studies indicate that at least a third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do it deliberately. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication devices when passengers carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="184"> The airlines allow passengers to use Wi-Fi for cruising altitudes for several years. </seg>
<seg id="185"> The aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The vast majority of airliners should allow a wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, &quot;said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Electronic devices today generally emit radio transmissions of power much lower than previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Readers of e-books, for example, emit only minimum transmissions when you turn a page. </seg>
<seg id="189"> But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for an easing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In 2011, the company&apos;s leaders have charged an airliner of Kindle e-book readers and flew to see if there were problems, but there has been no. </seg>
<seg id="192"> That inspired the members of the advisory committee of the FAA mixed feelings about the question of whether the use of devices present a risk. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the interference from the aircraft were real, even if the risk was minimal. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with airplane systems, and that most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="195"> However, the committee recommended that the FAA allows pilots to ask passengers to turn off their devices during the instrument landings in low visibility conditions. </seg>
<seg id="196"> A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, the appellant arrangements full of common sense for travellers equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="197"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with the security,&quot; said Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="198"> The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain for the time being in force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="199"> The Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their shelves and their smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the United States&apos; gesture aimed at easing the rules on electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight on condition that they are in &quot;airplane mode.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="201"> Passengers can already do so for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="202"> The Australian carriers are examining the decision that obliges the U.S. carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not have the immediate intention to change their procedures. </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="204"> &quot;Casa has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices by plane,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="205"> The issue is the subject of a regulation that obliges the aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security at all times and passengers to respect the safety instructions given by the crew members. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Virgin, which has already spoken to the CASA of its intention to expand the use of its inflight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said that it would follow the regulator. </seg>
<seg id="207"> &quot;We would welcome a review by CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the inflight entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our aircraft,&quot; said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Qantas said that she met for the moment the current rules. </seg>
<seg id="209"> &quot;In accordance with our current policy, the electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the short term,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="210"> The FAA&apos;s decision applies to US airlines. </seg>
<seg id="211"> However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit the passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA&apos;s decision and the reasons for it. </seg>
<seg id="212"> For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="213"> The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, and revise the manuals, training materials, transportation program of hand luggage and the instructions provided to passengers. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Once an airline has tested the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,&quot; said the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="215"> In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The group also recommended that the heavier devices are safely stowed under the seat or in the overhead bins during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools </seg>
<seg id="218"> On Wednesday, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in children in school. </seg>
<seg id="219"> This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publishes, since the number of school-age children with food allergies has soared. </seg>
<seg id="220"> One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff to food allergies in children, and how to deal with them in case of allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="223"> It also recommends that the schools to have a stock epinephrine - brand auto-injector EpiPen is the most commonly used - to be able to respond quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The state legislatures have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Children can say, &quot;I have the impression that something I pique the language,&quot; &quot;I have the impression of having a hair on the language,&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m tingling on language.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="227"> Many opposition to medical assistance to die in Congress of palliative care </seg>
<seg id="228"> The Canadian Congress of palliative care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="229"> This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement. </seg>
<seg id="230"> If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them want to end their lives, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette. </seg>
<seg id="231"> If we focused on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would be minimal. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die. </seg>
<seg id="233"> If it is adopted, Alberte D√©ry is concerned about the impact on future generations. </seg>
<seg id="234"> &quot;What is the meaning of life,&quot; she lamented. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients to die, according to the vice-president of the Alliance of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Maison Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway. </seg>
<seg id="237"> We never ask us: &quot;I want to die, give me an injection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="238"> The director of the Association for Palliative Care Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the bill of Quebec misleads people about the vocation of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="239"> He does not believe that Ontario will develop. </seg>
<seg id="240"> For its part, the Liberal MP from Gatineau, St√©phanie Vall√©e, argues that the concept of end-of-life will have to be clarified before the bill is adopted. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Halloween 2013: In figures </seg>
<seg id="242"> When I was a kid, Halloween was magical. </seg>
<seg id="243"> My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, to go to bed late and dress up to go in the vicinity. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Today, I have become more stingy. </seg>
<seg id="245"> In the past two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not more this year. </seg>
<seg id="246"> But the stats show that I&apos;m the black sheep when it comes to Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation. </seg>
<seg id="248"> What I look forward to every Halloween, these are the trends. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The costumes should represent $1.2 billion on the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="250"> This year, the sexy inanimate objects are all the rage. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizza, hamburgers and carrots. </seg>
<seg id="252"> For men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series &quot;The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in the area of Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year. </seg>
<seg id="253"> According to Google, the most wanted costumes are the zombies, Batman, pirates and witches. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I suppose that there is no harm to remain. </seg>
<seg id="255"> We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they were not the only ones. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In fact, the Americans will spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="257"> It&apos;s been a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When it comes to candy, pile. </seg>
<seg id="259"> The Americans will spend $1.9 billion in candy this year, according to the Nielsen. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, pacifiers, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars. </seg>
<seg id="261"> This is a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. </seg>
<seg id="262"> In fact, we are going to buy and, let us be honest, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The candy corn is the only thing that we do not want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association. </seg>
<seg id="264"> This represents about 9 billion of corn kernels. </seg>
<seg id="265"> It is a mystery that I am not yet arrived to elucidate. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Nothing is more representative of Halloween the haunted houses. </seg>
<seg id="267"> They are the best names, such as &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which is actually a real prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="268"> In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and that includes these amazing pictures of you pee all over you that your friends are on Facebook and you cannot remove and on which a type that lets you enjoy a &quot;nice head.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="269"> Finally, talk of pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Charlie Brown Grosse Pumpkin presented us when we were kids, and carve a pumpkin lantern-shaped, it is like decorating a Christmas tree - that is something that it has done since it is very small. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Fortunately for us, &quot;the tendency of the baby-pumpkin&quot; began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved gourds, and they did not have to sit inside. </seg>
<seg id="272"> This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="273"> The pumpkin-lanterns that wither gently on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year. </seg>
<seg id="274"> If you want to get out more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve a pumpkin of 922 kg. </seg>
<seg id="275"> Transportation of schoolboy: The admissible complaints </seg>
<seg id="276"> The Commission scolaire de la R√©gion de Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires since the beginning of the school year fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from the school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Before the changes in the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was concerned,&quot; says Ms. Lef√®vre. </seg>
<seg id="279"> According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and she requested more time to think about it. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It is always better to talk, to consult and find solutions,&quot; said Ms. Lef√®vre. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The Commission scolaire de la R√©gion de Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not want to comment. </seg>
<seg id="282"> The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="283"> DRC: The army attack on the last rebel stronghold </seg>
<seg id="284"> Diehard fans of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were dug to nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the hills of Chanzu and Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two communities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. </seg>
<seg id="285"> &quot;It hasn&apos;t stopped since this morning, the fighting continues in spite of the night,&quot; told AFP an inhabitant of Jomba, reached by telephone at 12: 30, according to which a girl was wounded by a bullet in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="286"> &quot;The intensity of the fighting has decreased slightly,&quot; he added, &quot;it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC, pushed a little rebels.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="287"> According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had &quot;spent the night in Jomba before getting to the front for a&quot; search operation. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="288"> It was very much behind him crackling fed arms. </seg>
<seg id="289"> In Bunagana, political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons. </seg>
<seg id="290"> According to a source at the UN mission for the stabilization of the DRC, fighting came &quot;in a final phase,&quot; &quot;FARDC surrounded the positions of the residual M23 to remove them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="291"> Since the resumption, Friday, clashes between the Mouvement du 23 Mars (M23) and the army, the Monusco is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides crucial support to government troops in the field of intelligence, observation and planning. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In late afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were in the direction of the front line. </seg>
<seg id="293"> They were armed with Kalashnikov rifles and rocket launchers. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, post-border with Uganda, the military helped civilians mandated a multiple rocket launchers mounted on a brand new truck FARDC, to ensure the succession of another gear pounding M23&apos;s positions on the hills. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called again on Wednesday evening the rebels to &quot;disband voluntarily or be disarmed by force,&quot; but left open the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and the M23 discussed since December without result for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="296"> On site, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;We have completed the talks, it only remains to the Ugandan mediators to organize the signature,&quot; said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of the M23, without this information can be confirmed immediately on the government side. </seg>
<seg id="298"> The M23 was born of a mutiny in April 2012, former rebels, mainly Tutsis, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id="299"> The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuses Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which refute Kigali and Kampala. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC, and its subsoil is rich in mineral resources. </seg>
<seg id="301"> At Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement back to the DRC, which had started in the morning was reversed in mid-day. </seg>
<seg id="302"> &quot;This morning we retravers√© to go in our fields, but the soldiers told us to get back,&quot; told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back. </seg>
<seg id="303"> One has the impression that the shots are close. </seg>
<seg id="304"> In the early evening, dozens of people crossing the border, some with a mattress on the head, to spend the night in Uganda. </seg>
<seg id="305"> The Israeli army killed a member of Hamas in Gaza-SCES </seg>
<seg id="306"> Gunfire from Israeli tanks killed on Thursday a Palestinian militant Islamist Hamas and seriously wounded another in the south of the Gaza Strip, after it learned from sources of health services. </seg>
<seg id="307"> A source close to Hamas said that fighting broke out in this region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were covered by your Palestinian mortar fire. </seg>
<seg id="308"> The Israeli army has merely to evoke a &quot;targeted action&quot; in the area near a tunnel described as &quot;terrorist&quot; by the Hebrew State, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="309"> The concern related to security in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts between powerful figures </seg>
<seg id="310"> At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique&apos;s founding president, the Aubele, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo chanting peaceful slogans during a rare public event. </seg>
<seg id="311"> &quot;We want peace returns; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, general manager of an investment company. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Concerned for the future of his country, she has exchanged his work clothes against a T-shirt bearing the words &quot;We want security&quot; in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="313"> For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement which was signed more than 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="314"> The rebel movement Renamo was once a famous, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country&apos;s independent government. </seg>
<seg id="315"> After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it has become an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population. </seg>
<seg id="317"> The stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="318"> The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other tensions. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The Renamo said that the government is behind the recent clashes and that he launched an attack against its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October. </seg>
<seg id="320"> The attacks on the former rebels were then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, spokesman for Renamo, according to the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The government makes Renamo responsible for initiating the conflict, and accused him of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay the concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday at the AFP, the French news agency, that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;all the forces that he had to try to prove that he could impose its decisions to the government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="324"> The Frelimo and Renamo insist they both want to avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="325"> But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the peace agreement in 1992. </seg>
<seg id="326"> He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was not respected by the Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="327"> &quot;We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The previous discussions between the parties have failed to defuse tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year. </seg>
<seg id="329"> &quot;These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop to compete,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="330"> None of them knows negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="331"> The Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November. </seg>
<seg id="332"> The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as a patient&apos;s attempt to obtain concessions and a war chest from the government. </seg>
<seg id="334"> The share of votes collected by Renamo continues to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, should get a larger number of votes in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country. </seg>
<seg id="336"> &quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because it does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="337"> It is not known exactly what is the ability of Renamo, but she conducted disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major highway north-south axis. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where is Beira, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, exporting coal. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In June, Rio is no longer able to use the railways for about a week after Renamo has threatened to attack the railway line. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Mr Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would reiterate this threat. </seg>
<seg id="341"> The Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The instability has strengthened the frustrations about the government, &quot;said Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings. </seg>
<seg id="343"> &quot;People think that those responsible for the country&apos;s future are the government and the president, and that it is up to him to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people wanted only stability. </seg>
<seg id="345"> &quot;Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="346"> PIA: At least four injured in a violent brawl </seg>
<seg id="347"> The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excesses of fever on Thursday evening. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Three police cars, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the testimony... </seg>
<seg id="349"> On the day of Halloween, the evening was troubled by the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Four minor injuries at least would be regrettable. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Alerted, the gendarmes went to separate the warring parties and to ensure that the wounded are cared for. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia </seg>
<seg id="353"> A pastor who took care of the young, in the region of Halifax, Nova Scotia, is accused of child pornography. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested Friday morning after searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council, where he works. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor operated, said he was deeply saddened by this news. </seg>
<seg id="356"> In a statement, the church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position. </seg>
<seg id="357"> The pastor was released on conditions. </seg>
<seg id="358"> It does not include contact persons under 18 years of age and do not have access to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="359"> He is scheduled to appear in provincial court in Halifax, in December. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Coulson has used phone hacking to verify a pipe </seg>
<seg id="361"> The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a bogus pipe on a route involving the Interior Minister, Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his &quot;pretty special advisor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="363"> It has been reported to the Court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective to hack voicemail to Pawlby and &quot;permanently planted in front of the door,&quot; but Coulson has also called and left voice messages. </seg>
<seg id="364"> &quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the house of people hoping the surprise, that is the kind of man to love make history for people to see what they say,&quot; said Mr Edis. </seg>
<seg id="365"> He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the topics: Phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="366"> The editor is personally involved in the third. </seg>
<seg id="367"> It is clear that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it could not be otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="368"> But what of the first? </seg>
<seg id="369"> Had any knowledge of phone hacking? </seg>
<seg id="370"> He claims to the contrary, but we say &quot;Of course if.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="371"> The rumors of an affair involving Clarke were reflected in the first by the NotW editorial office when a source, with sexually attracted to miss Pawlby, said that he was told: &quot;Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="372"> A band, which were made of pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The investigators also found on the computer seized from private investigator involving Miss Pawlby and his sister rows in a file &quot;Projects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="374"> During the period when the detective investigated it, the grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls where they were asked about it, &quot;said Mr Edis. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of every move of Miss Pawlby. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In a voicemail message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: &quot;I have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> Mr Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett. </seg>
<seg id="378"> The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was attending the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having made the phone hacking. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Rescue plan of $325 million for the health system of Tasmania </seg>
<seg id="382"> The federal government maintains that the rescue plan of $325 million for the faltering health system is subject to strict conditions aimed at ensuring that the state government funds are not wasted. </seg>
<seg id="383"> The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to end a crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic disease and system constraints. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The funding, provided over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="385"> &quot;The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state is facing,&quot; said Ms Plibersek today. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The plan of $325 million includes a $31 million campaign for elective surgery. </seg>
<seg id="387"> 2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help to catch up. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Funds are also earmarked for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better patient care, medical staff training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;These investments are responding to the idea that, according to the frontline clinicians, it is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system,&quot; said Ms Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The Minister said the Tasmanian government would be faced with a strict regime of reporting and accountability. </seg>
<seg id="391"> The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where he spends the additional funds. </seg>
<seg id="392"> A committee composed of three people will be established to ensure that the State provides the most effective and efficient way possible. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much unless they are followed by a genuine reform to strengthen the public health system of Tasmania. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> He nevertheless praised the government for having responded to the request for urgent assistance he presented to the Prime Minister in early May. </seg>
<seg id="395"> &quot;I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to remove the public health system of Tasmania from the black list,&quot; said Mr. Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="396"> According to the state government, these additional elective procedures largely reverse the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But the spokesman of the opposition health Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s announcement is a &quot;a makeshift solution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the State withdrew $430 million of its health care system,&quot; he said on ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="399"> You cannot have a state government that hard almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth, which is $300 million, and pretend that this is a good day. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Mr. Dutton visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that every dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="401"> He walk through the mud, the jungle and crosses rivers to provide free medical assistance </seg>
<seg id="402"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="403"> Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="404"> There are not a lot of doctors in this West African countries, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Vote here or via your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="407"> You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect &quot;CNN Hero of the Year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="408"> This person will receive $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="409"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help her. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="411"> At the beginning, he had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that has spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would bring the legacy the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="412"> &quot;There was no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="413"> We would have taken abroad if we had enough money. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Instead, Dr. Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, to obtain any treatment he could benefit. </seg>
<seg id="415"> &quot;This is not easy,&quot; says Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="416"> You can leave home at 5 a.m., you rush to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first. </seg>
<seg id="417"> There are a lot of patients. </seg>
<seg id="418"> People can die because they wait too long. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The situation has not changed much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="420"> In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="421"> By comparison, the U.S. ratio is 1 doctor for 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay the consultation. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country&apos;s health expenditures are carried out in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="424"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; explained Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="425"> And because of poverty, they cannot take advantage of life. </seg>
<seg id="426"> After seeing his father and his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have practiced more than 700 surgical procedures for free during the last year. </seg>
<seg id="428"> He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaounde Central Hospital. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And it has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, who travels in rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Almost every Friday, with some 30 people, they live in overcrowded vans after having set the medical equipment on the roof and through difficult terrain to visit the villages that are most in need of help. </seg>
<seg id="432"> Luck does not always follow. </seg>
<seg id="433"> They have repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks. </seg>
<seg id="434"> But when they arrive, they were received as heroes: The community is organizing a celebration, sings and dances and offers them the best available housing. </seg>
<seg id="435"> In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="437"> &quot;We get 500 people at each visit,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="438"> They may reside at 60 km from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="439"> In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate - document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In the evening, the team practice of simple surgical procedures under local anaesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The operations are generally practised in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave his seat to the next person. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and sterilization equipment, Dr. Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="445"> It is an exhausting pace, but the musicians villages in general, helping the team to stay motivated. </seg>
<seg id="446"> &quot;They hit on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="447"> On Sunday, the team returned to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done. </seg>
<seg id="448"> The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgical procedures for free during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they support. </seg>
<seg id="449"> A man explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a hernia would allow him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;It will change my future and that of my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="451"> In addition to live this mobile hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaound√©. </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is the second job, he explains, which funds to 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="453"> &quot;I don&apos;t know when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O&apos;Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer within the group of Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="454"> He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to carry out these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="455"> For medical students and nursing students like Katie O&apos;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in its missions, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they were not among them. </seg>
<seg id="456"> &quot;It was able to participate in operations to help mop up the blood or move the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explained Miss O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This is not something that you have the opportunity to make in America when you are second-year medical student. </seg>
<seg id="458"> The student volunteers typically pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected. </seg>
<seg id="459"> But once in Yaound√©, their pensions, their transport and education are cared for by Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;It is a hero, there is no doubt,&quot; said Katie O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="461"> He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not about to extinguish. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For Dr. Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a problem. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Helping others to live happily taking the promise he made to his father is something that gives him an immense joy. </seg>
<seg id="464"> &quot;I am so happy when I do this work,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="465"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="466"> I hope he sees what I do. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that lead me to do that. </seg>

<seg id="470"> The interior has bucket seats and harness belts to 6 points, as well as an Intercom system. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Among the options include improved brakes, a service providing access to mechanics Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between two events. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Drew Bowler, the Director-General of Bowler Motorsport said: &quot;The rally enthusiasts who join Bowler have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="473"> They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events. </seg>
<seg id="474"> We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and the realities of rallying raids. </seg>
<seg id="475"> We had a lot of fun to develop the vehicle of the Defender Challenge - the championship will really be exciting. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="477"> The two France Pierre Nora </seg>
<seg id="478"> Perplexes, academics have long struggled to identify and locate Pierre Nora. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Professor in the lecture halls and classrooms? </seg>
<seg id="480"> Without doubt, but by emphasizing its low for the paths, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Referee of the works of others in his office of the rue Gaston-Gallimard? </seg>
<seg id="482"> Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden underground work and writing of the publisher. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Heir of the chair that occupied Fontenelle at the French Academy? </seg>
<seg id="484"> True, but knowing that such a coronation cannot replace the real holy oil, that of the thesis, which happened. </seg>
<seg id="485"> They readily acknowledged him as a great Paul, facilitator and convener of their work, but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce itself. </seg>
<seg id="486"> In this image uncertain the monument &quot;Places of memory,&quot; which he has attached his name, also contributed. </seg>
<seg id="487"> The selling were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and weighted with erudition, but hopelessly dilettante. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The two books published by Nora nearly two years have already established that whoever was not to write was a lot and well written. </seg>
<seg id="489"> The book is expected to make a definitive justice. </seg>
<seg id="490"> There are, however, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, vagrancy intellectual, the jubilation to jump in with both feet from one subject to another. </seg>
<seg id="491"> But it soon becomes apparent that the disparate objects collected in this book so beautiful title back to the dealer at one and the same passion: Discover the crux of French identity. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Why these dramatic appeals for national unity? </seg>
<seg id="493"> Identity: It is a concern. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Here are few, we were collectively invited to give a definition. </seg>
<seg id="495"> But in the spirit of our leaders peremptory, French identity was a timeless essence. </seg>
<seg id="496"> He did that by deploying accidents, and the matter, forcing Jacobinism, was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects, interpreters. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The that stalking Pierre Nora is quite different. </seg>
<seg id="498"> It does not arise in heir of an eternal French roots, he refuses to the definition. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Analyst worried a strangeness familiar, he wanders in a forest of symbols, arrested at every step by a riddle-shaped object, tormented irritating questions. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Including this one, which comes from the company itself: Why, in a country where permanently installed within its borders, if formerly-boned and solidly masoned, we mean these dramatic appeals for unity? </seg>
<seg id="501"> They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to avert the disorder born of discord in French history. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Amendment and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundian, Catholics and Protestants: The forces of division, here are very old. </seg>
<seg id="503"> And the most emblematic is obviously the one that breaks in two national history. </seg>
<seg id="504"> From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, another revolutionary. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The second was to the death of the first, but without reaching the deny; instead, anxious to regain the sanctity and even more eager to unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head that was the obvious and powerful incarnation. </seg>
<seg id="506"> And, from there, a binary invinciblement nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution. </seg>
<seg id="507"> To be felt this singularity of French identity, nothing beats the four not out of France, so that the American getaway of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to start a new company. </seg>
<seg id="509"> But the American parentage only better highlight what is our own. </seg>
<seg id="510"> There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Here, men crowded a native Ancien R√©gime, and even more radical. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Here a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Here the founding fathers always honored, and here the revolutionary ancestors who are struggling to make models, and the rest between-killed. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Here an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as errors to catch up and testing to resume. </seg>
<seg id="515"> France, which is going, France has </seg>
<seg id="516"> There has been a time when the French have believed to reattach the torn dress in their history, and overcome the curse of the number two. </seg>
<seg id="517"> At the Third Republic, Central time and creator, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: Welcoming those who were then used to repair the fracture revolutionary, teaching schoolchildren everything in the former France was preparing obscurely modern France and offering them a unified version of their history. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But this peaceful identity had only a time. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Here she is again in the debate, damaged by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European area. </seg>
<seg id="520"> The book offers both a fascinating portrait of France who goes and the cautious outline of France. </seg>
<seg id="521"> With the portrait of the historian, which should reserve a few surprises. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It discovered that the chemineau was an unambitious. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The prowler edges stood at the centre of the center. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And those who had filed, here is more than a half-century, a topic on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiation of the thesis, &quot;says, cum grano salis, he will eventually make it. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Certainly in a less steep, more fragmented and more subtle. </seg>
<seg id="527"> But let us make no mistake, just as binding. </seg>
<seg id="528"> For much more than the figure imposed by the university curriculum, this thesis, said the need for an inner life. </seg>
<seg id="529"> How biometrics will invade our lives </seg>
<seg id="530"> No more typing passwords for access to its smartphone or pay its purchases? </seg>
<seg id="531"> American researchers, French or Japanese we predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, believes that &quot;the biometric century will be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="533"> Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person who engages in a transverse and transnational world that the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="534"> The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but fear it. </seg>
<seg id="535"> In 2011 alone and in France, the Commission nationale de l&apos;informatique et des libert√©s authorised 774 fingerprint recognition systems, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in enterprises, administrations, canteens... </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,&quot; is moved Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="537"> The reasons for such optimism, for some, and pessimism, among others? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Biometrics will rely on new techniques, which will make new services to citizens and consumers. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are the fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous system of the palm and fingers. </seg>
<seg id="540"> But each of these techniques has its constraints. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;For example, some people who work the concrete have severely damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,&quot; said Philip Robin, technical director of the field of identity with Thales Communications &amp; Security. </seg>
<seg id="542"> And the collection and verification of the venous system and the contour of the hand imply a voluntary gesture and specific individuals. </seg>
<seg id="543"> It is both a security - you cannot capture these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: The procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time. </seg>
<seg id="544"> As a result, research is conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye). </seg>
<seg id="545"> Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of sensors and the ability to calculate the computers needed for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The accuracy of facial recognition has grown tenfold in the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the R &amp; D laboratories of Accenture in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="547"> With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition. </seg>
<seg id="548"> It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion. </seg>
<seg id="549"> &quot;Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with the aid of sound sensors, but there is a quiet environment,&quot; said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Unique marker and tamper-proof, DNA also raises hopes and concerns. </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;In the current state of knowledge, it can be seen as the ultimate biometric data,&quot; says Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of education, innovation and foresight to the CNIL. </seg>
<seg id="552"> But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="553"> NEC offers the police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour. </seg>
<seg id="554"> The use of biometrics are divided into two groups: The identification (recognize a person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is that it claims to be. </seg>
<seg id="555"> The identification was so far the issuance of identity papers: We must confront the biometrics (fingerprints, iris) with the information that the state has on all citizens already on file. </seg>
<seg id="556"> This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp the identity of someone else. </seg>
<seg id="557"> This principle of comparison may have other applications. </seg>
<seg id="558"> NEC offers and VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store. </seg>
<seg id="559"> &quot;We&apos;re getting the images of surveillance cameras and compare them with photos of celebrities who move freely on the Internet,&quot; said Dany Nassif, responsible, NEC in France, business development for biometric identification solutions. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Other Use: Take a picture of a third party that makes the tail in a shop, monitor its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Authentication had initially involved physical access (borders, secure premises, canteens...) or logical (opening a computer). </seg>
<seg id="562"> If there is added, more recently, the control of presence. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;A biometric dowelling avoids the phenomenon of the guy who points to another,&quot; justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture. </seg>
<seg id="564"> But, increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, particularly those from devices connected to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and asking his hand on a biometric reader: This gesture replaces the minting of the secret code. </seg>
<seg id="566"> A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d&apos;Ascq and Angoul√™me by society Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of mass distribution: At the time to pay in-store with her bank card, the customer does not stage its code, but introduces his finger in a reader that scans the veins. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The experiment is scheduled to last six months. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If it is successful, the biometric readers may soon arrive in the French traders. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Tracks to reassure users </seg>
<seg id="570"> There are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public. </seg>
<seg id="571"> The first is to explain that it can save time. </seg>
<seg id="572"> &quot;If, through biometrics, a client remains in cash thirty seconds less, it is significant,&quot; says the director of a large area. </seg>
<seg id="573"> The second is to offer personalized services: In a few years, a voice server can recognize your voice and suggest options. </seg>
<seg id="574"> And, finally, reassure highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases. </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;The fingerprints are stored on a server; the identities of the people are in a second base: The correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which hangs if you try to move it,&quot; enumerates Philippe Robin, Thales. </seg>
<seg id="576"> But, in the absence of comprehensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Experts on the protection of privacy, they continue to worry. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, lead me to fear the worst: A blanket surveillance,&quot; predicted Andrew Patrick, the Office of the Privacy in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Frontier Airlines plans to pay the hand luggage </seg>
<seg id="580"> Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers who carry-on luggage on its flights. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Frontier Airlines plans to begin charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in his announcement Wednesday, she indicated that the passengers could carry the can not open with them on the descent of the plane. </seg>
<seg id="582"> The new hand baggage fees on bags stowed in the overhead compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travellers paid only once at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="584"> The spokesman for Frontier, Kate O&apos;Malley said that the $100 were intended to encourage passengers to pay in advance. </seg>
<seg id="585"> &quot;We do not want to pay the price,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="586"> The airlines have begun to charge for the first and second checked bags in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were as much as they could in carry-on luggage stowed in the overhead bins, and there was often more room in these compartments. </seg>
<seg id="588"> These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board. </seg>
<seg id="589"> O&apos;Malley said that these new fees will not be used to raise money. </seg>
<seg id="590"> It is the most loyal customers of Frontier that it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the overhead bins. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Passengers who buy their tickets on the site of the airline will not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For example, a passenger queuing at a gate Frontier could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue may have to pay $100 for a similar bag. </seg>
<seg id="593"> O&apos;Malley explained that the site and the registration procedures of Frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before arriving at the door. </seg>
<seg id="594"> The cost of hand luggage of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other charges, but the airlines the love. </seg>
<seg id="596"> They believe that the baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Many people on Wall Street believe the addition of baggage fees as a sign that proves that the airlines are paying enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Yet many of them have not affected at the expense of baggage. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage fees three years ago, and the low cost carrier Allegiant followed a little later. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the extra costs. </seg>
<seg id="601"> He said, in a report in December 2011, that the cost of hand luggage of Spirit reported $50 million per year. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when the passengers would experience the unusual hand baggage fees imposed by the company. </seg>
<seg id="603"> &quot;I had never seen a boarding procedure as fluid in my entire career,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="604"> I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the door. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The plane was full, he added, &quot;the passengers boarded at lightning speed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> Frontier also as Spirit and applies a fee of $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the can not open with them, and those who take coffee may be resservis free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="608"> It will distribute water free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Us Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers complained and then that no other major airline had followed. </seg>
<seg id="610"> The Frontier&apos;s decision to pay a fee for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is his latest effort to encourage customers to go on its site. </seg>
<seg id="611"> The airlines are paying online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="612"> This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than go to an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, Frontier went further in this area. </seg>
<seg id="614"> In September, she began to offer only half of miles of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="615"> On Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of miles from 25% on a trip. </seg>
<seg id="616"> For example, a trip Frontier de1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they buy their tickets directly on the site of Frontier. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home town, Denver, but its activity is declining and it loses money. </seg>
<seg id="619"> Revenue fell by 9% and flight capacity fell by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Republic has tried to redress the finances of Frontier by selling the airline. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Previous studies had shown that dogs happy remuaient more their tails to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while the remuaient nervous dogs more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="623"> But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;Everyone knows that, in humans, the left and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that are positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> Here, we tried to see what it was in other species. </seg>
<seg id="626"> He added that as well as in humans, dogs on the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="627"> For more information on how the dogs react to the disorderly movements of tail other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching films containing other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="628"> They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="629"> It is surely not long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;We have presented to dogs films containing other dogs - a naturalistic version is a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors - and we were able to fix the movement of the tail and present it as going to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> When the animals have seen a dog without expression stir the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="632"> But when they spotted a tail deviate mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate has accelerated and they looked anxious. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate them through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Instead, he believes that the dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry. </seg>
<seg id="635"> He added: &quot;If you have repeatedly other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you respond to this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="636"> The researchers suggest that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right for canines. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turned his head to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog and to the right when he was a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="639"> And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;The dogs were more easily to a robot dog when its tail had shaken to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is contained in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="640"> He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that have participated in various studies did not fully animals films or robotic dogs like dogs. </seg>
<seg id="641"> A study on how the dogs react to real dogs could be useful, &quot;he explained. </seg>
<seg id="642"> &quot;Although many elements, among different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="643"> However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered, it is surely not long before we understand why their tail moves sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other. </seg>

<seg id="650"> Living together in French, the challenge of the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys </seg>
<seg id="651"> At the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than English. </seg>
<seg id="652"> That is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and staff members of education, to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between several cultures. </seg>
<seg id="653"> The school board has just unveiled its vision of &quot;Living Together in French.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="654"> The organization Vision diversity wanders for a year in schools to help students from all backgrounds to discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are benchmarks. </seg>
<seg id="656"> The big names of writers, artists, whether ethnic or whether they are from elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Who are our builders? </seg>
<seg id="658"> &quot;So, we create projects so that they identify with it,&quot; says president Vision diversity, Aida Kamar. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, has identified several challenges for the school board. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;On the transmission, for example, what is the Quebec culture, a sense of belonging, support staff in the changes that we live within the student clientele,&quot; lists. </seg>
<seg id="661"> The Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys has established a research center that will provide the tools for teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="662"> Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director. </seg>

<seg id="666"> Obama puts an end to the eavesdropping on the IMF and the World Bank </seg>
<seg id="667"> Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end the eavesdropping quoted on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the framework of its intelligence activities, said an American official, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="668"> This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to resume his hand in the case of the NSA&apos;s eavesdropping after the revelations made by the former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="669"> This is the first time that is mentioned the supervision of the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Asked about the topic, a US administration official replied: &quot;The United States does not lead to electronic surveillance for the seats of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="671"> Speaking under the cloak of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance was put in place in the past. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Another official, he indicated that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in recent weeks. </seg>
<seg id="673"> This instruction was given at about the same time as putting an end to the tapping of the UN headquarters in New York. </seg>
<seg id="674"> In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government programs but allowed monitoring their continuation. </seg>
<seg id="675"> The commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a limit of five years for the conservation of such information. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The European stock markets down in mid-session, except London </seg>
<seg id="677"> With the exception of London, the major European stock markets are down Friday at mid-session, sealed by some disappointing corporate news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Moreover, investors remain cautious because they believe that the Federal Reserve could resolve its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected. </seg>
<seg id="679"> Conversely, after the announcement of an inflation to 0.7 per cent for the whole of the euro area, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id="680"> The future of Wall Street suggests an opening of US stocks rising, after two consecutive sessions of decline. </seg>
<seg id="681"> The values, Renault (-4,63%) recorded the biggest decline in the CAC 40, crippled by the warning on the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marked the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published the results down this morning and announced the creation in-house or hive-off (&quot;bad bank&quot;) with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets. </seg>
<seg id="683"> For its part, Vodafone (+ 2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press briefing that AT &amp; T is considering a possible takeover bid. </seg>
<seg id="684"> On the foreign exchange market, the speculation about the evolution of the ECB&apos;s monetary policy are going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank. </seg>
<seg id="685"> The ECB&apos;s sole mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting next week. </seg>
<seg id="686"> We anticipate a strong potential for decline in the euro. </seg>
<seg id="687"> In this context, the euro continued its decline against the US currency and touched in a two-week low at 1,3517 dollar. </seg>
<seg id="688"> These same conjecture argue the opposite the eurozone bond market. </seg>
<seg id="689"> This judgment means that a law adopted in July in the state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force. </seg>

<seg id="691"> Each time, it is the school population that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Through five plays devised and performed by artists from the region, stamps with a strong dose of humour, it allows adolescents to tame the classic song. </seg>
<seg id="693"> In addition to the show, the Soci√©t√© d&apos;art lyrique du Royaume will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that is now a packed house at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi. </seg>
<seg id="694"> Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives the opportunity for local artists to show what they are capable of. </seg>
<seg id="695"> In these activities has added the lyrical Zurich, the benefit concert held last August, with the assistance of the coloratura soprano Marie-√àve Munger. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It was an event, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the nonprofit organization to produce a balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears that an air of the bat. </seg>
<seg id="697"> Without deliver precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Despite the precarious that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well, even in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="699"> We have more solid and constant support. </seg>
<seg id="700"> &quot;The finances are afloat and we hope to be up to the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step ahead in seven years,&quot; said the administrator. </seg>
<seg id="701"> &quot;I would say even beyond,&quot; said the Director General, H√©l√®ne Gaudreault, smiling. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The Congolese army chasing the rebels of the M23 </seg>
<seg id="703"> The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the rebels of the M23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda. </seg>
<seg id="704"> The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of the localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) he controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, the insurgency. </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;We will continue the M23 and cornering wherever he hides because they are criminals,&quot; told Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC. </seg>
<seg id="706"> We must not allow them to reorganize because they martyrisent the Congolese people for too long. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The time has come to bring peace. </seg>
<seg id="708"> Officials of the M23 explained that it evacuated localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on Wednesday that the military setback does not alter its claims to the peace talks. </seg>
<seg id="709"> The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="711"> At their peak in November, the insurgents have occupied Goma, capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the leak of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco. </seg>
<seg id="712"> The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of manpower, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African soldiers, Malawian and Tanzanian. </seg>
<seg id="713"> For its part, the FARDC Staff has been redesigned and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23, change the course of the war. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The pace of government troops today is unprecedented. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The M23 appears to be coming to an end,&quot; predicts a Congolese affairs expert, Jason Stearns, Congo siasa on his blog. </seg>
<seg id="716"> That would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa Government manages to beat a major insurgency. </seg>
<seg id="717"> And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group ally in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC. </seg>
<seg id="718"> United Nations experts have accused Rwanda, which denies it fiercely, supporting the M23 militarily, initially set up by former Congolese military mutineers. </seg>
<seg id="719"> The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military reprisals following the shells fell on Rwandan territory. </seg>
<seg id="721"> On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the village to welcome the entry of FARDC soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="722"> &quot;We lived a year with the M23 and we seemed unimaginable to one day be released by the army,&quot; says a resident of this town of Uganda. </seg>
<seg id="723"> &quot;We lived in terror (M23), we are traumatized,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="724"> John Kerry conceded an unprecedented, that American espionage &quot;had gone too far inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> John Kerry indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States vis-√†-vis its monitoring programs in unprecedented admission that, on several occasions, espionage had gone too far inappropriately. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="726"> The Secretary of State has also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on &quot;autopilot&quot; when a series of incendiary whistleblower Edward Snowden&apos;s revelations about the NSA&apos;s spying activities. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Leaks have put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: &quot;It is undeniable that the president, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, since the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on September 11.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="729"> He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone&apos;s rights had not been violated. </seg>
<seg id="730"> He said: &quot;In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="731"> And the president is committed to try to clarify and make clear to people that he was now a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels wrong. </seg>
<seg id="732"> I can assure you that the innocent people will not be abused as part of this process. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good, and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="734"> He added: &quot;We live in a new world where people are ready to blow up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="735"> There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, exploding and attack the governments. </seg>
<seg id="736"> And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act? </seg>
<seg id="737"> We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings to explode and people to be murdered because we have become aware of the facts in advance. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Meanwhile, the American legislators will travel to Europe to meet the concerns regarding the alleged U.S. spying affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said Thursday, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and other this week, and that he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the sense of frustration about the supervision of the National Security Agency. </seg>
<seg id="740"> &quot;It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in the mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and President of the European Affairs Committee of the U.S. Senate, in an interview from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="741"> And I&apos;m going to go to Europe to reassure them that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA&apos;s programs. </seg>
<seg id="742"> The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with some U.S. allies, however, the director of the agency said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it was metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted communications and data from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The intelligence director, James Clapper, justified spying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said his office was organizing a trip of the Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The names of the other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="747"> He said that the route remains to be defined. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, but also to show &quot;tough love.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> He explained that the European heads of state were to be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programmes that they apply themselves for years. </seg>
<seg id="750"> &quot;We can change our surveillance programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to conduct espionage,&quot; said Murphy. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry had planned to visit this weekend in the Middle East and in Poland to manage the resentment created by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the surveillance activities of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="752"> The appeal of Scott Brown rejected </seg>
<seg id="753"> Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches for his club, against Ajax and AC Milan. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Sent against Barca for having sent a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment had his suspension extended to three games by UEFA. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In a statement, the club said he was &quot;very disappointed,&quot; considering that his appeal was entirely justified. </seg>
<seg id="756"> For the CEO of Titan, &quot;the proposed purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee&quot; </seg>
<seg id="757"> Having thrown in the towel noisily in January for the partial resumption of the site Goodyear Amiens-Nord promised the closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the US tyre manufacturers Titan, expresses, today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 in the factory. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Jean, Minister of productive recovery, had already announced, on Monday 21 October. </seg>
<seg id="759"> Having dropped the proposed purchase of the plant in January, you come back today. </seg>
<seg id="760"> You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of &quot;so-called workers,&quot; who &quot;work three hours per day,&quot; mad &quot;unions, the CGT. </seg>
<seg id="761"> It does not include this volte-face. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Is it to please Mr. Jean? </seg>
<seg id="763"> I try to make pleasure to anyone. </seg>
<seg id="764"> With my wife. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="765"> Mr. Jean, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid. </seg>
<seg id="766"> If I have hurt someone by my words, I am sorry. </seg>
<seg id="767"> But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The truth hurts you? </seg>
<seg id="769"> Working seven hours a day when in other countries working eight hours handicaps France. </seg>
<seg id="770"> In India, China and in many other countries, working 10 to 12 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But I did not prejudice on France. </seg>
<seg id="772"> What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand. </seg>
<seg id="773"> Why did Titan both need this plant? </seg>
<seg id="774"> Titan did not need to buy the plant. </seg>
<seg id="775"> But, with the right price and skilled workers, it is worth a try. </seg>
<seg id="776"> What do you expect agreement between the CGT and Goodyear? </seg>
<seg id="777"> If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered to employees a good severance pay, I believe that 100% of employees have accepted. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Now, imagine that Titan buys from Goodyear plant closed. </seg>
<seg id="779"> Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union countries, which still has its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="780"> I think that Mr. Jean knows this. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs. </seg>
<seg id="782"> Titan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1,200 Goodyear&apos;s current employees. </seg>
<seg id="783"> He needs to win a commitment of Titan before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Therefore, there will be more employees in the factory. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Mr Jean said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs over four years. </seg>
<seg id="787"> The confirm? </seg>
<seg id="788"> The only number that I mentioned to the minister, 333. </seg>
<seg id="789"> I know that he would like to a four-year guarantee. </seg>
<seg id="790"> But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits. </seg>
<seg id="791"> If all employees will accept them, the proposed purchase of the plant starts with zero employee. </seg>
<seg id="792"> How can we give guarantees of job duration when there are no more employees on the site? </seg>
<seg id="793"> If he manages to win what the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we intend to remain in Amiens-Nord over four years. </seg>

<seg id="802"> The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="803"> The Supreme Court validates the law to reform the health system of Obama </seg>
<seg id="804"> Great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court said today that the legislation to reform the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional. </seg>
<seg id="805"> By 5 votes to 4, judges have validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Law on the Protection of the sick and affordable care) - which requires that citizens buy health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine - and said that it was constitutional under the government&apos;s power to tax. </seg>
<seg id="806"> The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed. </seg>
<seg id="807"> The Court also validated the other sections of the law of 2,700 pages and has also considered that the provision of the law to reform the health care system, which stipulates that we need to lower the threshold for eligibility for Medicaid under penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="808"> The procedure to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="809"> All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in contention during the primaries in 2012, including the nominee Mitt Romney, are fiercely opposed to the law. </seg>

<seg id="816"> The Legend of Thor could show that &quot;brute force is no match for the subtle trick,&quot; while the celtic legends show the importance of having a dream. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Saying that many myths would be &quot;far too violent, too outrageous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at school,&quot; Crossley-Holland called for a &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate works. </seg>
<seg id="818"> &quot;I think it is wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I am in favour of this project for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="820"> He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are &quot;openly didactic&quot; because children &quot;drop out completely,&quot; the messages being &quot;prepared&quot; in pleasant stories. </seg>
<seg id="821"> Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf of the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse myths and British Folk Tales, said: &quot;You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="822"> Maybe the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope. </seg>
<seg id="823"> Not that everything has to be simplified or finish well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong. </seg>
<seg id="824"> And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than said. </seg>
<seg id="825"> The basis of what is shown and that it does not say. </seg>
<seg id="826"> Green light for the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merger </seg>
<seg id="827"> Publicis and Omnicom said Friday that it had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, is closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency. </seg>
<seg id="828"> The merger brings the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis. </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;Omnicom Group and the Publicis Groupe announced today the expiration of the review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,&quot; the two groups announced in a news release. </seg>
<seg id="830"> They say that they have also received the necessary approvals in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea. </seg>
<seg id="831"> The expiration of the planned review by the HSR to the United States and the licensing decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the necessary conditions for the r√©alisationde operation. </seg>
<seg id="832"> &quot;The merger is also subject to obtaining other regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of both groups,&quot; it added. </seg>
<seg id="833"> New application for class action against the Holy Cross brothers </seg>
<seg id="834"> A new request for class action lawsuit was filed against the Holy Cross brothers, involving sexual assault, which allegedly took place this time at the St. Joseph&apos;s Oratory as well as in several orphanages, schools and colleges. </seg>
<seg id="835"> The request was based on the testimony of the claimant, identified as &quot;J. J.&quot;, which would have been masturb√© in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher brother Submitted, followed by his confessor Father Bernard, at the St. Joseph&apos;s Oratory, where he was serving as a church and where his father worked as a painter. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The first appeal was only three institutions, and when we announced the settlement, many people told us: &quot;Me, I was there, I can subscribe?,&quot; said the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two appeals. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The class action that has just been tabled to allow for the addition of complainants to any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of St. Croix. </seg>
<seg id="838"> At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers. </seg>
<seg id="839"> The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort, since many of the targeted schools have closed their doors in the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The appeal also stresses that the congregation of St. Croix and St. Joseph&apos;s Oratory, which is a separate entity, &quot;provided that sexual abuse is perpetrated against children,&quot; that they had a &quot;compelling moral, religious and psychological on the victims,&quot; they were aware of sexual abuse perpetrated and have suffocated, &quot;and that they&quot; knowingly and deliberately chose to ignore the problem. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="841"> These accusations are based on letters written by the Holy Cross brothers&apos; lawyer, Me √âmile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by the research in the archives of the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former St. Croix&apos;s brother who publicly denounced the abuse. </seg>
<seg id="842"> The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in Superior Court. </seg>
<seg id="843"> Once the admissibility accepted by the Court, it is the second stage, the hearings on the merits. </seg>
<seg id="844"> In the case of the first resort, the congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings are conducted on the merits. </seg>
<seg id="845"> DRC: The army is preparing a new assault </seg>
<seg id="846"> Children play on a charred armoured that belonged to the rebels of the M23, Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in the east of the DRC. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The Congolese army was preparing Friday to a new assault on the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 near Bunagana, in the east of the DRC. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The objective is to dislodge the M23 hills overlooking Bunagana. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Yesterday, we took the Bugina hill, which overlooks the Mbuzi. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Today, Mbuzi is expected to fall itself. </seg>
<seg id="851"> There will be more than the Runyonyi hill. </seg>
<seg id="852"> &quot;That of Chanzu is not very strategic,&quot; said AFP was the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Mr. Paluku plans to visit Saturday Bunagana. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Since then, hundreds of hardcore of the M23, are cut off to nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the hills of Chanzu and Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba </seg>
<seg id="857"> At Jomba, a resident who had reported fighting nearby throughout the day Thursday indicated that the situation was &quot;calm since this morning.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="858"> According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the previous day and were buried. </seg>
<seg id="859"> A young girl was shot and wounded, and three other people were injured, one critically, evacuated by the FARDC, added the witness quoted by AFP. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two sides gave no assessment of the casualties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> The court blocked a decision on the policy of control and search of the NYPD </seg>
<seg id="862"> A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the search and control program of the New York Police Department and has divested of the file. </seg>
<seg id="863"> The Appeal Court of the United States (Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of the judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal of the city. </seg>
<seg id="864"> The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="865"> The city has appealed his findings and its remedial orders, including a decision to allocate a controller to assist the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The Appeal Court heard arguments Tuesday on the request for suspension. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The appellate court said that the judge had to be divested of the case because it violated the code of conduct for judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which she responded publicly to the criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The judge had ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting of black and Hispanic men in their search and control program. </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has appointed an external auditor to oversee the changes, including political reform, training and supervision, and she ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the neighbourhoods where the largest number of controls. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In August, the city of New York has agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The hearing of the appeal of the city should take place after March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The tactics of control and the search was criticized by many civil rights defenders. </seg>
<seg id="873"> This search and control system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level ever in 2011 with 684,330 controls that were mostly black and Hispanic men. </seg>
<seg id="874"> A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and has turned into collective action. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Supporters advocating changes in the monitoring program and search of the NYPD say they will put an end to the unfair practices, will have more effective police forces and we trust, and may change the way police departments use of politics. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after the number of police officers were greatly reduced over the past decade. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The judge stressed that it did not put an end to the search and control practices, which are constitutional, but that it was reforming how the NYPD was implementing its controls. </seg>
<seg id="878"> The revelations of the NSA increase corporate paranoia with regard to the monitoring of State </seg>
<seg id="879"> On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="880"> On instructions from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, located within 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of antennas listening and that the operation has sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="882"> James Clapper, the director of the US intelligence services, insisted again in September on the fact that the United States do not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> But since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, has begun to unveil his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of the supervision of the United States, European governments and business leaders do not know whether to believe the director on the floor. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. suppliers of storage in the cloud services, including Google and Yahoo, have generated more than ever the paranoia of businesses with regard to the monitoring of State. </seg>
<seg id="885"> The revelation that the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, maybe even for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. </seg>
<seg id="886"> If the most powerful person in Europe may be covered, then business leaders are surely also potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Snowden made transparent intensive cooperation between the American intelligence services and businesses. </seg>
<seg id="888"> I think it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest. </seg>
<seg id="889"> &quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; said Oliver Gr√ºn, president of BITMi, which represents the German SMEs in the IT sector. </seg>
<seg id="890"> The German companies believe that the United States represent a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY. </seg>
<seg id="891"> However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has provided trade secrets of foreign companies to American companies. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Politicians have expressed concern at the idea that the EU does not have adequate computer and Internet capabilities and think that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="893"> Business leaders are skeptical about this. </seg>
<seg id="894"> A member of the German parliament said that we should create a Google German. </seg>
<seg id="895"> I can only close their eyes and reopen slowly... </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;This is not the right way to do,&quot; said Hasso Plattner, president of the German business software company, SAP. </seg>
<seg id="897"> If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then it should not let her die 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Everything is subsidized in Germany, coal to cars, from farmers. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Everything except the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Yet the scale and sophistication of the American spy agencies exposed by Snowden&apos;s revelations were a shock for some companies who thought until then that China was the biggest risk in terms of monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="901"> A big change is happening in cloud computing since the European leaders have realized that the data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of such jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="902"> According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, about 10% of non-American members have abandoned their plans to use a U.S. supplier of storage in the cloud services after the revelations about the US data mining programme Prism. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Jim Snabe, SAP&apos;s co-director, said: &quot;Our customers now ask us a question that they do not pose a year ago: Where my data is stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="904"> Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at any price. </seg>
<seg id="905"> It is not surprising that there are economic espionage. </seg>
<seg id="906"> There are always had. </seg>
<seg id="907"> &quot;It is a recurring theme for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion,&quot; said Kurt Bock, Director General of the chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="908"> The Americans spying on us on the commercial and industrial plan, just as we are frisking, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it would leave the advantage to an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Large companies have long hammer the message that it is very unwise to recover a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the Audi car manufacturer, said that the collection of mobile phones before the board meetings, so that they could not be used as a remote listening devices, is a common practice for years. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when they travel abroad because of the risk of undermining the integrity of smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown. </seg>
<seg id="914"> However, there are fears that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="915"> In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,&quot; the BfV warned in a report. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The United States warn their own societies on the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="918"> The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, France, Russia and Israel, guilty of second-degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="919"> A member of the board of directors of a German company renowned believed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="920"> Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: &quot;The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, spying on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> A tax on foreign property owners to burst the bubble in London </seg>
<seg id="922"> The Treasury has provisionally quantified the extent of the capital gains tax, but is awaiting a final decision by Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has registered a 7% stamp duty on properties costing more than ¬£2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold properties in the context of a society rather than individually. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, and represents ¬£708 million in fiscal year 2012 / 13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber region combined. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Mr Cook said: &quot;Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that the high-value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the housing tax system obsolete.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or the current owners reluctant to sell,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="926"> The prestige real estate - the 5-10% of the highest price of the real estate market - in the prosperous south-west of London, which stretches from Fulham at Wimbledon, rose to a record high of 11.8% over last year. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Prices in central London show a steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by an &quot;internal market&quot; growing, south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills studies. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise of the car market </seg>
<seg id="929"> The closure for 16 days of most of the federal government has weighed on growth of car sales in the United States in October, show figures released Friday by the manufacturers, five of the top six with lower performance expectations. </seg>
<seg id="930"> The Big Three Detroit automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Analysts on average expected 15.4 million in annualized sales and adjusted for seasonal variations but the market was $15.3 million, according to estimates from Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. </seg>
<seg id="932"> In a note to clients of the bank, he believes that this slight brake is explained primarily by &quot;the shutdown of government and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> Nevertheless, GM has reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month in 226 402 cars, compared with 211 563 expected by the consensus. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The group&apos;s four brands have seen their trade performance improvement compared to October 2012. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Ford, which continues to enjoy the success of its pickups, saw its sales increase by 14% over a year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194 301. </seg>
<seg id="936"> For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared with 143 536 expected. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Toyota and Nissan also have sales below the consensus, despite increases on a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively. </seg>
<seg id="938"> At the New York Stock Exchange, GM earned 1.4% to 16: 35 GMT, while Ford ceded 1.1%. </seg>

<seg id="947"> A study designed to multiply the benefits of HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government. </seg>
<seg id="948"> The work of HS2 Ltd suggests that the high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as the opening of Phase 1 in 2026. </seg>
<seg id="949"> The Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project &quot;would bring together the United Kingdom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="950"> The Scottish transport minister, Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; at the idea of working with the British government on the project. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="952"> When Phase 2 will be completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> In June, the government has increased the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from ¬£32.7 billion to ¬£42.6 billion. </seg>
<seg id="954"> The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of the rail capacity and improved journey times for the north of England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="955"> This must include the possibility of journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh for three hours. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="957"> We are pushing the proposed HS2 because the benefits are enormous. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Without him, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="959"> But it is also developing connectivity between the 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are best thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, said: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="961"> For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael &quot;unequivocal&quot; support for the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed train has the potential to provide significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also provides the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network throughout Britain. </seg>
<seg id="963"> &quot;So we are excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine the options to bring the network of high-speed train to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning. </seg>
<seg id="964"> &quot;I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together the next steps.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="965"> The United Nations welcomed the new objectives for the fight against poverty </seg>
<seg id="966"> The United Nations will now get to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Australian diplomats have played a key role in the promotion of &quot;sustainable development goals&quot; intended to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro. </seg>
<seg id="968"> They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to &quot;move beyond national interests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="970"> &quot;I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process aimed at setting universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="971"> The SDO will build on the progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework. </seg>
<seg id="972"> I will do its utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs. </seg>
<seg id="973"> The parents of intersex children may choose &quot;undetermined sex&quot; </seg>
<seg id="974"> Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The male or female of newborns will not be attributed, rigidly, at birth. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter a sex &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on his birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions concerning sexual reassignment surgery for their babies, and to combat discrimination against persons intersex. </seg>
<seg id="978"> According to the BBC, a person intersexed said years later, &quot;I am not a man or a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="979"> I will remain the patchwork that created the doctors, bruised scar face. </seg>
<seg id="980"> It is estimated that one in 2,000 born each year, is neither a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="981"> They are intersex, intersex part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorder, a generic term for people with chromosome or gonads (ovaries or testes) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The sexual identification is still not well understood, but most U.S. experts say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information for the award, and then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical procedure, if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and sexual identification expert, said that the new German law &quot;seems to be a good idea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="985"> The intersex children pose an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="986"> &quot;Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical procedure, but this is not the case for most children,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how the identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="988"> The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise. </seg>
<seg id="989"> No one can answer the question of why this happens. </seg>
<seg id="990"> It is like the mystery surrounding the homosexual persons. </seg>
<seg id="991"> A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different transgender people or transgender, since their status is not linked to sex, but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other. </seg>
<seg id="992"> These characteristics can manifest themselves in the secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), the primary sexual characteristics (such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="993"> The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by transgender and intersex people in employment, as well as the magnitude of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="994"> The young boys of gender non-conforming now have camps specifically targeting them. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; on their official documents. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized &quot;neutral&quot; after winning his appeal hearing that allows him to keep an unspecified &quot;sex&quot; for life. </seg>
<seg id="997"> The German passports will include a third nomination alongside M or F-X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="998"> In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="999"> In 2011, dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country have signed a petition for the &quot;gender theory&quot; be removed from the textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> The US Catholic Online site also objected to the German law, writing that &quot;because the world is dragged into a new reign where the genre is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, it reversed two other pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1001"> In Maryland, the mother of an infant on Baby Zone also said that she would prefer that a sex is attributed to babies at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> &quot;The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said on the site for young parents. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> The children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> Historically, children born without male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a dual sex. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> And there is barely a decade ago, the medical community saw the kind as a slate, which can be erased and on which we can redraw. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> But now, many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel its sexual reassignment when he grows up. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> &quot;In the middle of the 20th century, we called it a psychiatric emergency,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> When these children were born, it did not call the psychiatrist, telephoned the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered that the genre is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - interact with genes and hormones in the shape of a child to be identified as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> But in a case of 1966, known as the &quot;John / Joan,&quot; his theories have led to controversy. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> He had advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to castrate entirely, by removing the testicles, and raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> &quot;Money presented this as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> At the age of about 15 years ago, he became a boy and was married to a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But at 38 years, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Drescher said that some doctors &quot;always repeat this model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1017"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived the sex-change operations, saying that &quot;they are not satisfied with the result.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a &quot;satisfactory&quot; life as a man. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> So shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce has undergone a surgical removal of the external body and testicles and raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> He had been taking female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> &quot;I knew that I was not a girl,&quot; he said on ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> At 18, he has suffered a vaginoplastie. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical records. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> What he found was horrified. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> I&apos;ve been sterilized at birth - and nobody had ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS), which prevented her body to produce testosterone enough for his sexual organs could develop. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> After learning the truth, he became a man, following treatment with testosterone and remove the breasts. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The surgery rendered sterile. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to standardize the perception of intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law &quot;invites labelling and stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> &quot;Many activists worry that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child a&quot; undetermined &quot;sex,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> We fear that it encourages the interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> We believe that it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supported Australian law because it &quot;allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1038"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The German law concerning the allocation of sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> This is not a battle that young children should lead at that age. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz Lake, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is a mess of sexual development and that helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law &quot;will empower&quot; parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The daughter of Dr. Baratz Lake, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called androgen insensitivity syndrome complete. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Today aged 29, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;The law provides flexibility for parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions,&quot; said Baratz Lake. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> That leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay to include &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Thus, all is well - you can raise your child and love it. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> You don&apos;t have to rush for surgery, which is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> &quot;This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Finally, the child will decide sex with which he / she feels the most comfortable - and this is something great. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> This allows the child to take the decision for himself. </seg>

<seg id="1057"> Minors aged between 9 and 13 years were door-to-door for candy on Halloween night. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> One of the residents of the neighborhood of Le Muy visited by children opened the door with his hunting rifle. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> The old man, 86-year-old, explained to the police that he had been afraid. </seg>

<seg id="1061"> The cry of despair of a voter Obama </seg>
<seg id="1062"> I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change </seg>
<seg id="1063"> He said that Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by the Republican Party obstructionism </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare website, nor the attacks drones </seg>
<seg id="1065"> The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what might have happened </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at the Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I&apos;m trying to read a book horribly sad these days. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> This is a book that, I thought, I would encourage during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and I would hope. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It is called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and these are the memories of Barack Obama&apos;s presidential campaign in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and go to sleep, this book remm√®ne me at the time the policies inspired millions of people and where the speeches were breathtaking. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> The election ended with a landslide victory and news presenters of took the time to think about the historic nature of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> My comrades wept with joy and my parents have retained all the newspapers that they have found. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> A young team of visionaries moves into the White House and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> During the transitional period of Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82% of favourable opinions. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> And then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> The return to the present is a rude awakening, it is like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, it is as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The change really happened in the years since the first time I voted. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> This had nothing to do with what I had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> I put to the credit of Obama&apos;s major achievements since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of the &quot;&quot; and the assassination of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation in the field of immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> But after repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and my colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> I am on the edge of despair. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of foreign children innocent by drones. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the evils of government. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> It cannot justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public financing and exceeding the authorized spending during the presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which said that the efforts of the White House to mute media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1088"> And, more recently, she cannot excuse the inability to develop a simple Web site for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act was ratified. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> I don&apos;t know if that is what I expected. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance, such as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> That is what bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> I have voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Mitt Romney had an alternative confused and refined that did not seem to help determine its policies or positions. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that were heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Yet, while the index of favourable opinions plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> It makes me want the many promises that have soared. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses for the benefit of Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> At a meeting of post-campaign, he told his team that they can get back on track and remain faithful to their cause. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> &quot;I want us to recentrions on our talent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> We must remember that we are. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="1118"> RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of market manipulation of currency is beginning to bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Some of the world&apos;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the financial market, the largest in the world, with 5.3 trillion changes hands each day. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the survey, which echoed the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> &quot;The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators,&quot; said a representative of the bank two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had transmitted records of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European head of foreign exchange spot trading at JPMorgan. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Rohan Ramchandani, European head of the spot foreign exchange trading at Citi, was placed on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> None of these traders had been no charges. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> The case of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent to and from bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup, said sources close to the case. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> UBS said this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, FINMA, said that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> In the world, at least six authorities - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the CFA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - examine the allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate the rates on the foreign exchange market. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said sources close to the case. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The banks picked instant messages and emails for years to find instances of wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The news about these investigations have shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currency that limits the opportunities for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast foreign exchange market highly liquid, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between the management platforms of trade and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms, &quot;says that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at low cost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1136"> The news came on the same day that the Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in his office funds traded on the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> The bank has quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> &quot;We are convinced that the trader had acted alone and that the case was brought under control,&quot; said a representative of Credit Suisse. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> A Chinese newspaper, which launched an appeal &quot;will be overhauled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1140"> A Chinese newspaper, which launched an appeal on the front page for the release of a journalist charged with libel will be overhauled, said a press regulator. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> The New Express, based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> At present, the New Express will undergo a &quot;complete overhaul,&quot; said the governor. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The order of &quot;realignment&quot; comes from the administration of Guangdon for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the group Yangcheng Evening News, had published several articles on the listed company Zoomlion wrong between September 2012 and August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> &quot;The drafting of New Express was disorganized,&quot; the regulator said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> He said that he had decided &quot;to impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou withdrawing his press card.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1148"> He also ordered the &quot;Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that he is conducting an investigation into the individuals responsible for New Express and immediately rewrites the newspaper&apos;s management team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> But Mr. Chen is then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he published false stories for money. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> &quot;In this case, I have undermined Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public,&quot; he told the public television network CCTV. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> I have done mainly because I was running after money and fame. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I realized my mistake. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Following the apology from Mr. Chen, New Express published an apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Several key suspects have recently made televised confessions. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Experts say that people are routinely forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Obama backtracked on its reform of the health system </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his promise unambiguously and often repeated that &quot;if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1160"> After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days, accusing it of misleading the American people. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Yesterday, Barack Obama has adjusted its promise of origin. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> &quot;The vast majority of people with health insurance that they can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Speaking of what he calls &quot;a boom in the news&quot; about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek a new insurance on the market. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive health plans and better suited for the same price, even for much less expensive than expected. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> &quot;You&apos;ll be rewarded in,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> The Administration announced that one should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who get their own insurance were forced to change their diet because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> &quot;Let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better,&quot; said widen during his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had &quot;failed miserably.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1169"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> I look forward to regain your trust. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It is an exasperated widen who made this sentence, while she believed his microphone cut from an assistant sitting behind it at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Missouri Republican representative, whether it should join the Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to urge to Ms. Sebelius why &quot;the architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, it now boasts to millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The tribute to the Coen brothers&apos; folk </seg>
<seg id="1174"> &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis,&quot; the Coen brothers, Grand Prix last year&apos;s Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village in 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has been the subject of a retrospective at the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise, had won the Palme d&apos;Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen entrusted the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> In this film, full of humor where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac is an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in &quot;Gatsby le magnifique&quot; for less glamorous clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the expletive debited to the submachine gun when she speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to break through and gets annoyed with the whole world. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> He accepts backwards replacements at short notice in the studios. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> Without shelter, he toured the sofas of friends who still want to receive it. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> A documentary air </seg>
<seg id="1183"> &quot;His relationship with the success is tortured, that is what we wanted: A mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, which is not happy but integrates with self-destructive behaviour,&quot; said at the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel several Oscars and prize at Cannes. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers folk music fans have built their history on real personalities of the time as the folk musician Dave Von Ronk. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, a neighborhood of New York to become &quot;the epicenter of the folk music boom that would create international stars,&quot; as the journalist writes Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> The film is then resemble a documentary, dusty music label invasion of unsold 33T inhabited by an old unpayable secretary, musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where were the singers. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character through the film constantly: A beautiful red cat under crispy, makeshift companion of Llewyn Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having &quot;grew up in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1189"> &quot;My first music lessons have been given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> For Justin Timberlake, if the work is required to be considered good, &quot;&quot; the chance may also launch the career of someone, &quot;and&quot; increasingly today. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1191"> As Llewyn Davis refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explained that in a career, &quot;the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can prevent us to express ourselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Chevron, the second American oil company, reported Friday a decline in its quarterly profit because of the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining a retreat from the objectives of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> Its third-quarter net profit fell to 4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, up from 5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Analysts polled by Reuters were based on average earnings per share of $2.71. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The group has produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd products a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> The company aims to 2.65 million bpd for this year, with growth of 25% of production expected by 2017. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> The majority of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Because of the cost of these projects, the annual investment spending increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The benefits of production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million. </seg>

<seg id="1211"> The NSA spying: The United States is &quot;gone too far,&quot; admits Kerry </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The United States may be gone &quot;too far&quot; in terms of espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in the midst of controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA). </seg>
<seg id="1213"> After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a U.S. government official admits explicitly controversial practices in the NSA&apos;s interception of communications and data in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> &quot;In some cases, I admit, as did the president, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this does not happen again in the future,&quot; said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he participated in Washington Thursday, October 31 by video link. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> In his speech broadcast, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the leader of American diplomacy has largely justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Citing the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had foiled since many planned attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and information gathering. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> &quot;We have actually prevented planes from falling, that buildings explode and that people are murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects,&quot; argued the boss of American diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> And, said John Kerry at the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been deceived.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1219"> But we are trying to gather information. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> &quot;And yes, in some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately,&quot; admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> He assured Thursday night that President Obama was &quot;committed to try to clarify and that it was reviewing these practices so that no one feels deceived.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1222"> But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> The newspaper, citing documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, says the program called &quot;muscular,&quot; and carried out with the NSA&apos;s British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by the giants of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text or audio or video. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> These interceptions would take place outside the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But Yahoo and Google have denied any links with these practices. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, revealed that the NSA had intercepted a massive data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> Faced with the wrath of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was not aware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama has refused to speak about it, citing national security. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> By contrast, the boss of the NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied that its intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of European citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, prior to provide the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> This would include &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States, and it is not Europe, said General Alexander. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> And the controversy extended Friday in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Indonesia has summoned the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a broad international spy network has also attracted the ire of China. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Early does: Aging earlier </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> The physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent </seg>
<seg id="1238"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1240"> The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced among boys </seg>
<seg id="1241"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in health and family issues in children. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> A mother must worry if the breasts and pubic hair of his daughter start to grow at 7 or 8 years old? </seg>
<seg id="1243"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which was held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, paediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - in general, it does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> The obvious signs of development, such as the budding breasts, hair under the arms and the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But there was only a slight edge of the age of menarche over the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the US, the average age is 12 and a half years ago, when he was 12 years old three-quarters in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> &quot;Once the chest began to develop, there must be at least two or three years before the first rules appear,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also the author of &quot;Early&apos;s in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The time is the most sensitive test for how will evolve puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> There is a debate about what constitutes the onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;early&quot; when the development of the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In most cases, the development slows or stops - that is something that a pediatrician can monitor. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> A more rapid evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to avert serious problems such as tumors and cysts. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There are treatments to delay menarche and prevent other consequences: A premature aging bones that may dampen growth and a small size in adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The recommendations of hormonal drug treatment and are based on the child&apos;s age, the rate of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Kaplowitz is prudent with drugs but acknowledges that &quot;the fact of controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and the sensation for young girls to be different from others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want that their very young girls have their rules. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> &quot;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage the hygiene issues,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter had its first rules to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> She returned to school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are many theories made available to the public about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Yet, there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The boys, as girls, puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> He participated in a study carried out on girls aged 6 to 9 years that binds the percentage of body fat at the onset of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> In this country, the young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from climate-economic conditions, through the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Another problem: While boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend toward early puberty real is not as pronounced than among girls. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Other doctors attending the conference of the PAA stressed the complexity of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> &quot;We have to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician to know how to talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> &quot;This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; explained Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> If you stay calm, your child will respond well in general. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Girls with precocious puberty is to be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life. </seg>

<seg id="1286"> A former hostage in Lebanon: &quot;The return is quite complicated to manage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Removed in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his team &quot;Antenne 2&quot; to film a manifestation of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Since 2008, he participated in 2004 to the establishment of the association of the hostages hostages &quot;of the world,&quot; which he presides over the past several years. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Its main objective: To get the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Held more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Saturday (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc F√©ret were released on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Gr√¢ce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since reunited with their families. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> And try, little by little, to resume their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;The Nouvel Observateur&quot; asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former general reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association &quot;hostages in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1294"> On the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of 8pm &quot;Antenne 2.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> What are your memories of your release? </seg>
<seg id="1296"> On site, in Beirut. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because he is black - Roger Auque. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> He said to me, &quot;it is released,&quot; but I am not sure, and I think that we can still be killed. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> It is very excited, but also very tense. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> This is the war, and those who lead us are also very tense. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> They put us on the edge of a sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> There are the Syrian military. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Then we arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel, where the press is present. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The French lead us to the French Embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> This is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press... </seg>
<seg id="1306"> I remember taking a bath for an hour. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> And having dined in t-shirt at the French Embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate us to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Arrived there by helicopter, it takes a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> How did your arrival on French soil? </seg>
<seg id="1312"> It lands at Orly. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Chirac, Prime Minister, is here. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> It is a bit brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> There is an incredible stampede. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And a lot of media. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> When I left there were three television channels. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> I come back and there are full. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Between the airport and my home, many bikes are following our car that Roussin leads. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The bikers will derive stuffing to make pictures and follow me up to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent certain to rise. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> The media pressure is enormous. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> That doesn&apos;t stop, we are well placed to know... </seg>
<seg id="1324"> But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to comprehend. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> The fate of a hole and it is suddenly in the spotlight. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is a bit complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> But it was the hardest. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the evening, I am at 8pm, the next day as I am on TV. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Then begins a sort of readjusting to life, very slowly, for one or two months, which is a bit like a holiday. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> How have passed the medical examinations and debriefing DGSE? </seg>
<seg id="1331"> I had the right to an initial medical examination in Corsica. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> The rest was made in Val-de-Gr√¢ce the following days my return: Radios, all kinds of reviews and meeting with a psychiatrist. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> This is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can count on him, the recall if necessary, that it is not delivered to ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> It is part of the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> I also met with the intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> They asked questions about the hostage-takers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> It was logical. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> I was not embarrassed. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> How do you react, today, the release of four hostages of Niger? </seg>
<seg id="1340"> I listen to what is being said. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The debate on the ransom. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Some things annoy me, others less so. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> I&apos;m trying to strike a balance between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association &quot;hostages of the world&quot; that allows me to put distance, and seems much more interesting to discuss. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> I wonder, for example, on the definition of resilience. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Above all, I am fighting, with others, to recognition of the legal status of the hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> I think there is a problem of semantics. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> It should be called the hostage-taking of hostages &quot;political&quot; - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> But who said that these hostages might also have access to justice? </seg>
<seg id="1350"> A court in The Hague is done for that. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Why don&apos;t we say to the hostage-takers &quot;you have violated the rules of war, such as those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1352"> It seems to me, however, legitimate, struck in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> This message is heard but not listened to, and it shocks me. </seg>

<seg id="1393"> George Kerevan: The collapse of Europe gives the choice for Scots </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Another day, another disturbing story of independence. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> While it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde indicated the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it did not feature in the headlines (and it was to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Nor said that the EU Member States spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules when it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Because Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get the Scots. </seg>

<seg id="1401"> And a very old story that she is now frozen: I heard for the first time the hoax saying &quot;independence means the passport control&quot; more than 40 years. </seg>

<seg id="1403"> Why an independent Scotland should follow the instructions of Europe, in fact? </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Why share the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Here&apos;s the real news about Europe: The great post-war plan designed to unify Europe is definitely stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Across Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and come from nowhere, brought together nearly five million votes in federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> There has always been a domestic opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The European system instead poses to its members of the favourable exchange rates for German exporters - what the German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the southern European countries find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-√†-vis Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> Following the &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason to subsidize the French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> It is a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a cheap US shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> As a result, the pricking up, particularly in France, one of the great leaders of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and Paris on an equal footing with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> But Berlin has no need of Paris as a passport of his political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy undermined scramble. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> As a result, the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Front anti-European, has just won a crucial election, leaving the Socialists to power in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party who reminded him that he cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically left. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> What is Marine Le Pen with his new popularity among white working-class French? </seg>
<seg id="1426"> She wants to use the European elections next year to create an anti-single currency bloc and anti-European within the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> That is what I think: Very soon, the anti-European and anti-Europe&apos;s single currency will unite and will eventually kill the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The EU will not disappear, but it will be up to something that will look more like &quot;Europe of Nations (sovereign)&quot; free favoured by General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> I expect that the United Kingdom should take away from this project, and I hope he will be gentle eyes to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> And Scotland, in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1434"> We can choose to be a region of England (mostly). </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending around Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement on the condition that we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and maintain our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> The SNP government in Scotland is - and it should be noted - the anti-austerity political movement that has the most successful in Europe, as he won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the proposed cuts (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> A house engulfed in flames in the Old City </seg>
<seg id="1442"> A fire that broke out Friday afternoon in the Old Quebec was quickly mastered. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue H√©bert. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The flames were reported in a house of three apartments spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> All the tenants were absent during the fire. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> The fire was brought under control an hour after the arrival of firefighters, who were likely to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they have actually seen apparent smoke. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;So successive alarms, because it takes to attack the building, because it is glued buildings here,&quot; explained France Loiselle, spokesman of the firefighters from Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Spectacular &quot;wingsuit jump&quot; above Bogota </seg>
<seg id="1451"> The athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday of a helicopter in Bogota, the Colombian capital. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it rose to 160 km / h above the famous Coast sanctuary, located more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many onlookers had gathered to observe his feat. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> End of service for the chef of the Elys√©e </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Entered in the 500 m2 √©lys√©ennes kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook has worked all the way up to become chief, nine years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> He served six French presidents, Georges Pompidou to Fran√ßois Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation sites, and fed countless world leaders in a virtual anonymity it breaks that today, in the age of retirement at age 60. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> The man in the face, bald head and glasses of intellectual, born on October 24, 1953 in la Fert√©-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP pastry. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> His mother was itself a chef in a castle of Sologne. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;I moved from a castle! &apos;,&quot; says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only mania of the six Presidents for which he served, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;It is still the head of state or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menus,&quot; he recalls. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> &quot;Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, it came directly in the kitchen,&quot; to the point that it had banned women in the kitchens of the Elys√©e! </seg>
<seg id="1461"> With all due respect to the heads of state who had a relative indifference to the terrestrial foods, &quot;they&apos;re all greedy,&quot; denounces gently Bernard Vaussion. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Jacques Chirac had &quot;a somewhat more developed appetite.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1463"> But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were empty! </seg>
<seg id="1464"> As for Fran√ßois Hollande, who has restored the cheese, &quot;it is someone who likes to eat&quot; and &quot;there is not much that he does not like.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1465"> The current head of state, who returned to the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, &quot;did not request a specific regime.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1466"> Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially at state dinners at the Elys√©e Palace: We must serve &quot;between 200 and 250 people in about an hour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The night before is almost white. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> These people would not understand that there are mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Now the former head of the Elys√©e kitchens, which took a drink on Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, share with an aching heart &quot;.Fran√ßois Holland came to greet me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> He said praise. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;His human side emerged,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The head will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who is for 17 years at the Elys√©e Palace. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> A collision between two vehicles made four wounded early Friday, on Route 131 in Lanaudi√®re. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> Shortly before 4am, a motorist who was driving northbound in Saint-F√©lix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a car coming in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but we do not fear for their lives. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Traffic returned to normal around 6 a.m., on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> The investigation into the Mayor Rob Ford was botched, supports a lawyer </seg>
<seg id="1478"> After police confirmed that they have put their hands on a copy of the video showing Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that she had never seen an investigation &quot;also botched.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Ruby told me believe in The Canadian Press that the police had &quot;ignored or minimized&quot; the evidence against the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> On Thursday, police arrested the friend and occasional driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> The police said they also found this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Ruby me has described as &quot;inexplicable&quot; the fact that the police had never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his home, or tapped his telephone, arguing that the police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions by hand, might well have intercepted the vehicle of Rob Ford, the mayor, and a search - even without a warrant. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> It could also require a search warrant instant, if deemed necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Europ√§isches Fremdenrecht described the remarks of Mr. Ruby &quot;obvious and desperate attempt&quot; to argue with the media in a case that is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> At the press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that would constitute &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; that could lead to the filing of criminal charges against the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> A veteran of the armed wing of Hamas was killed this evening and another injured by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza. </seg>

<seg id="1490"> The German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo </seg>
<seg id="1491"> The union of German journalists on Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services from Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the American and British intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> &quot;The German Federation of Journalists recommends to journalists to avoid until further notice to use search engines and couriers of Google and Yahoo,&quot; she said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> It was &quot;scandalous&quot; information from the Washington Post, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) British have collected masses of information in infiltrating the international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> &quot;The research done by journalists are also confidential details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,&quot; said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> A room of the PMF of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night </seg>
<seg id="1496"> On Thursday evening, the first meeting of a film was interrupted in the Mega PMF from Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following stinging throat felt by spectators. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> Immediately, the director of the establishment ordered the evacuation of the room and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> About 70 people came out of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> People have been reviewed and a full recognition of the room is nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Bad joke against the backdrop of tear jet? </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Or involuntary incident? </seg>
<seg id="1502"> Nevertheless, the direction of the film played the precautionary principle and the security of its customers. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> The room was airy and everything was in order. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> The cinema was able to resume his rights and customers find the pleasure of the images. </seg>

<seg id="1506"> Explosion of a house in Gesves: A defective water heaters at the origin of the explosion </seg>
<seg id="1507"> The grandmother would have lit a cigarette at a gas leak. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The explosion of a home in Gesves, who made two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heaters, said Friday evening the substitute of the Crown Prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> The expert dispatched by the prosecutor ensures that the cause of the explosion is purely accidental. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The grandmother has lit a cigarette while there was a leak and an accumulation of gas. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The life of the two victims is still committed. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was badly burned. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> The boy, who was staying with her grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned more lightly. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> &quot;The two victims were intubated and conditioned at length on the spot before being taken to the University of Li√®ge, by helicopter, ambulance to him,&quot; said the mayor Jose Paulet, descended on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Traumatis√©, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Safe and secure, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remained intact, while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, weakened by the explosion, have been rehoused by the president of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The Andenne firefighters and Namur and Arches police intervened. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Civil protection of Crisn√©e has stabilized the two buildings. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> A black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="1521"> While the planners of the road network in the United States are struggling to find the money to repair the decaying highway infrastructure, many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that binds above the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The devices, which have all miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices of planning to overhaul the outdated system of financing of major American roads. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> The sector generally without interest in the planning of the main axes suddenly provoked a spirited debate and hectic alliances. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The libertarians joined environmental groups to exert pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you fly, and possibly the road on which you drive, and then use the information to write a tax bill. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern regarding the protection of privacy. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> They are looking how, over the next decade, they will move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles flown. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental spree. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> This is really essential for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;It&apos;s not as if we had the choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State is beginning to register the miles traveled by each Californian motorist by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> The technology is there to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> The pressure comes from the fact that the nation&apos;s Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> The Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> The cars can travel more miles a gallon. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> The federal tax itself, which is $18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while gasoline prices are high. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;The gasoline tax is simply not tenable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> His state has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a payment system for the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> &quot;It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Wonks called user fees to the mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> It is not surprising that the idea makes urban liberals, since the taxes could be used to change the driving habits in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the ambitious goals in the laws of the State on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also saw it as the most viable alternative in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers at the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> &quot;This is not simply a tax entering a large black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice-president of policy at the Reason Foundation. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> People pay more directly to the benefits procured. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The movement is also supported by two former U.S. secretaries to Transport, which in a report in 2011, urged the Congress to move in the direction of payment to the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The US Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> But the chairmanship of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to walk many miles every day to go to work or in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Several states and cities are still progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country&apos;s most important experience. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> These motorists will soon pay to the State kilometre charges instead of gasoline taxes. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> The Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The city of New York in a. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The Illinois is a test on a limited number of trucks. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> And the coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of America (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The concept is not a universal success. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> In Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists have recently equipped their car from a machine, drivers were worried that the government can track their every move. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> &quot;The concerns about Big Brother and these things are a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic management of the performance at the Department of Transportation of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> This is not something that people want. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1564"> It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily comings and goings of people. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> The Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles travelled a car, but without knowing the exact location or time. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> If we can do that, &quot;said Khan, citizens will be more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-up of California named True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Originally, the company did not always intend to help motorists who pay taxes to the states. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> She sought to break into the emerging market for auto insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But the devices that it tests have pleased the planners of the main axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;People will be more inclined to do that if you don&apos;t record their speed and did not locate them,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Big mistakes were made in the pilot programs in some states. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> There are ways far less expensive and much less intrusive methods to proceed. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> In Oregon, planners are trying experience by offering motorists different choices. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> They can choose a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> They can still choose not to have any device, preferring instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Other states are hoping to sell the concept of citizens distrustful by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> In the city of New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop a system of taxation that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide an assurance &quot;payment to conduct&quot; and create a set of data on the speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> &quot;Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,&quot; said a document on urban planning. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> However, some transportation planners wonder if the whole debate on the payment at Mile is not simply a huge distraction. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the Bay area of San Francisco, officials say that the Congress could easily manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> A single or additional annual fee could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of fuel, so that everyone pays their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;There is no need to resort to a radical surgery when it was simply need aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs with the commission. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned with the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> The British police issued a warrant for extradition against Assange </seg>
<seg id="1586"> The British police has today issued a warrant for the extradition of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London and requested political asylum. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Scotland Yard said that it had issued a &quot;notice of surrender&quot; against the Australian of 40 years, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he didn&apos;t, he would be arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Assange could be extradited to Sweden with allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court struck down an appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Fearing that Stockholm authorizes its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, calling on the South American countries political asylum. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Scotland Yard has issued a notice of &quot;against a 40-year-old man who asked him to report to a police station, the date and time of his choice,&quot; said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> He continues to violate the conditions of his bail. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Assange fears to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, having unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting the secret information. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Letta confident in the longevity of his government </seg>
<seg id="1595"> The president of the Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta finds that his government will hold until 2015, despite the high tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition with the approach of the Senate&apos;s vote to strip Berlusconi of his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he &quot;firmly intend&quot; to continue to govern with its coalition until the next general election in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s threat to withdraw its support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, addressed his dismissal. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> But some of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October 2 his refusal to bow to the demands of Berlusconi, who already wanted to bring down the cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For more than a year, everywhere, I am able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: Monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of all kinds, administrative costs no end. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In short, siphoning without limit of our pockets. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Millions of dollars squandered could be spared to allow a much taxation respectful of those who pay. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Any money forcibly abducted taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, on ne se g√™ne pas regarding the punch bowl and maintenance of lame ducks: Cultural Centre in deficit, high subsidy to the Cit√© de l&apos;√ânergie, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> If these facilities are not profitable, sold to private enterprise or demolish. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that never came. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers? </seg>
<seg id="1608"> This is not public levels to invest in these companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes to the Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Following the departure of all water-intensive industries () and the general population decline, water use has declined significantly across the territory. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Without wanting to say the waste, the city will never water and the strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with other people&apos;s money. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a settlement of borrowing. </seg>

<seg id="1618"> The tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of the rue Beaubien, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> In all likelihood, the work on the foundations were there for some time. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> A foundation wall adjoining had just been erected in the last few days. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site in order to recover its tools. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> I spent in the car and I saw the wall crumble with a large cloud of smoke, &quot;said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the site. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> I am landed and I went to remove the large bricks that covered. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> It was only a part of his back, it is so unfortunate. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> According to the authorities, the victim was an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a company of formwork. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> The resuscitation maneuvers have been tempted by the emergency services, but without success. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The man did not survive its serious injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> An inspector from the Commission of Health and Safety at Work was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The NSA involves an &quot;internal error&quot; and not hackers for the failure of its site </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the outage of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; said the spy agency in a statement by email. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> The problem will be resolved this evening. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Allegations that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Earlier this evening, the trackers of online servers noted that the site of the NSA had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users were still unable to access the site. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was &quot;not at all&quot; compromise. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> No classified information is not in danger, &quot;said the spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> At least one online hacktivistes group had claimed responsibility for the failure of the site of the NSA by DSD attack. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> DSD attacks are intended to inundate a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and that the site collapses. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the system&apos;s internal network. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> The NSA once ultra-secret, a time known as the &quot;No Such Agency,&quot; found itself in the spotlight and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs nationally and abroad - who are part of the NSA&apos;s secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former consultant disillusioned by the NSA, Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The growing controversy over the agency has caused a lot of speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a cyber-targeted operation. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The Delta Centre-Ville now closed </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Hotel Delta Centre-Ville closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The investment funds that owned the building was sold to developers who will transform it into student residences. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Of these, 200 have still not found a new job. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Delta promises not to abandon its employees. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Some employers have come to meet employees directly on site, we met individually with employees to assess their needs. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;This support will continue for the next six months,&quot; says the regional director of labour relations of Delta Hotels, F√©lix Bisson. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The closure of the Delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> The investment fund, which was the owner of the building had choices to make. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> Either he r√©investissait in the building to continue to operate, so there was investment of tens of millions, while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have emerged in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> &quot;Or is it sold to someone else, and that is what happened,&quot; said Paul Arsenault, Chair of Tourism Transat at the School of Management Sciences at UQAM. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, as the Crown Plaza, which will become a home for the elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be created within two years. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Do you want a neon ice? </seg>
<seg id="1657"> A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world of jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> He got the idea after reading a study of the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate chemically brilliant protein. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Ice cream reacts with the language by raising the pH of the protein to make it sparkle. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Chris explained that, since the cream begins to shine when it reacts to the warmth of the mouth, the more it licks, the more it becomes bright. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Charlie, the founder of the ice company &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious,&quot; said: &quot;This is something amazing, but we are still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2 grams of this thing costs about ¬£200.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the language neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> We have tested in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> This is probably the most expensive ice that I created because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Each ball costs me about ¬£140. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> But it was rather good taste! </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The company at the experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> But his next creation promises to be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> He added: &quot;I really would like to develop an invisible ice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1672"> It is inherently impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that form the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> A seriously injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels </seg>
<seg id="1675"> A road accident made a serious injury, at about 5: 30 Friday morning, on the inner ring from Brussels to drive in the direction of Waterloo. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The car of a driver was struck by a ghost driver, who was unharmed. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> The ring was closed to traffic until 9: 00 a.m., at the site of the accident, the time that the road to be removed and that an expert determines the circumstances of the accident. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> This situation, however, did not caused traffic jams because the accident took place at the height of the exit drive. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> The movement has therefore been deflected by this exit / entry of the ring. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris </seg>
<seg id="1681"> A child of five years was seriously injured as a result of an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His life is no longer committed but it is still hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> At the time of the collapse, the boy was with his father on a boat of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean attraction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1684"> It has been closed until further notice. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Snowden is ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany on the issue of US surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, said that he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> The German MEP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele met Thursday, Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> In a letter that the MP was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: &quot;Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> However, the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> As part of the complaint filed by the US Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of government property. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told the Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make sure to make this possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness &quot;without endangering and completely ruining relations with the United States,&quot; he should benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Mr. Str√∂bele, German Green MEP, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Mr. Str√∂bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, we should give him the assurance that he would be &quot;security&quot; there, &quot;said MP. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of persecution &quot;serious and sustained&quot; who had forced him to leave his country. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1701"> The citizens of the world as well as the senior officials - including the United States - have ruled that the revelation of an inexplicable permanent monitoring system of public utility. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The letter suggests an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will have been resolved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1703"> A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Thibaut Bouveroux, charg√© de mission scientist at the Centre for Conservation and Animal Science and Safe Marins (OCEAMM) returns for L&apos;Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you? </seg>
<seg id="1706"> This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> If in the past, the species have been described and identified on the basis of morphological, anatomical and geographic, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of the classification of species. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species of a genus, family, or even an order. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> At the beginning of the 19th century, morphological ranked animals, on the basis of morphological differences between the species. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Today, some of these rankings are called into question because of advances in genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> Similarly, two morphologically very similar species were distinguished thanks to genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> This is the case of the new species that has just been identified. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> There was a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and humpback whales in the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> Recent analyses have helped to distinguish four species. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Why is it a significant discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society? </seg>
<seg id="1716"> From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> If this population was already known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that she was part of a new species, only present at this location. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> A species is listed as threatened or endangered depending on the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that she had to recover from the neighbouring stocks. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species discovery is, its stock is automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Why is it unusual to discover new species of marine mammals? </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> They live in homogenous habitats, open, where there are many genetic exchange between populations and individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The mixing of genes limit the creation of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> It should know that the marine environment is the least well-known. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> It prefers to send robots on Mars, but to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 miles from the surface of the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> More money is spent in the search for life on other planets in marine research and it is high time that this change. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Clive Palmer claims that the MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> The MP billionaire Clive Palmer argues that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave because her daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> The mining magnate, who is contesting the payment of a carbon tax in the amount of $6 million, argued that argument to try to remove the questions about a possible conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes must be removed. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that the girls of Mr. Abbott were ready to personally benefit from these policies. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> &quot;It will be a major conflict of interest when it comes to pay parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact that it will leave or not,&quot; said Mr. Palmer. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of an overhaul of the system of remains of the votes to accelerate the process. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> This election should be decided two months after the vote is over? </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We need a better system,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Why can&apos;t we have a system in which you can enter, enter your details in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6: 30 a.m. the next morning? </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to paper to mark the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree? </seg>
<seg id="1744"> Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties &quot;very seriously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> &quot;We are not looking to reward, except the reward of history because we need to serve the community at a critical time,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to compete and win the trophy of the Horse of the Year, they knew that the competition would be fierce. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> But no one expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Not yet in school, and only a few months after his first, the toddler and her Shetland pony Toffee have been during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the 30 other competitors. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> The two inseparable - that are the same size - was praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at Sunnybank equestrian centre, at Rudry near Cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> Presenting himself against men and women in elegant bowler hats, he wore his flat cap a bit on the side of relaxed manner to scroll through his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural qualities of dressage uncommon for a child of his age. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and his personality. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Fenton took Toffee as a gift for his third anniversary last March and has since led with her Shetland pony every day. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> His mother Donna, 30 years ago, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1758"> They are presented against all odds, but both won the Gold Cup and the rosette. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> It was only the second time that he serves with Toffee and we were thrilled that he has won. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> On the runway, people who knew him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who participates in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Ms. Howells said: &quot;There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> He went through the entire length of the runway and even if he seemed to be very small, he has done a wonderful job. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Fenton is crazy animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> From the way he started, he will surely soon in the demonstration of the Horse of the Year - and I am sure he will make a good performance. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: &quot;Fenton has only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1767"> They are a good team. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well and how they marched on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> They seek effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> I am sure that its beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really terrific. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> The Defence Minister Rob Nicholson, insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> Attaqu√© by the Liberals and the New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the military followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> All the wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them is released before being ready, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the Injured - which do not meet the rule of &quot;universality of service&quot; in the army demanding that staff are able to perform a series of various tasks - to meet the eligibility period of 10 years required for pension benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In particular, they cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army, despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed pensions. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who testified before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed towards the exit before being ready because he did not meet the requirement of universality of service. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than the fact of wanting to leave the ranks. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> &quot;I told them that I was not ready,&quot; he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not able to battle. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Under the current rules, the seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain pension benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The Liberal spokesman for veterans, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the New Democrat Jack Harris has called for an immediate end to &quot;this shameful practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Air raid against military installations in Syria </seg>
<seg id="1787"> According to the Lebanese army, Israeli jets entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> A shipment of missiles short-range surface-to-air SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The new army aviation raid into Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The raid took place in circumstances virtually identical to the one that took place on 5 July: At the time, it is also an anonymous US official confirmed to CNN that an Israeli attack, this time of surface-to-sea Yakhont missiles, delivered by Russia in Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Life in prison for a former Chinese vice-governor </seg>
<seg id="1793"> A former vice-governor of Jilin Province, in northeast China, was sentenced Friday to life in prison for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having received more than 19 million yuan in bribes, the official Chinese media reported. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the chairman of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the first intermediate court in Beijing on his microblog. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, arguing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> If the head of state promised that justice would also be uncompromising with the powerful &quot;tigers&quot; and &quot;flies&quot; - junior officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The most dramatic recent case was that of the former leader of the Communist Party in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after he referred to the highest office in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> But the government has not expressed an intention to reform the system to combat corruption, for example by creating an independent body of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The benefit of Bombardier in decline, while the aircraft deliveries and orders fall </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Bombardier Inc., the Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a drop of 15% of its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its division Trains. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not provide any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information to know whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial service before next September. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> After the inaugural flight test aircraft about a month and a half, he stole only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The results were not up to the forecasts and stock prices fell by 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector perform&quot; because of the low potential for growth in the stock market over the next quarter or the next two quarters. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;Although the decline in aircraft deliveries had been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,&quot; said Cameron Doerksen in a note to clients. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> However, if no new order was announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> But the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft is modest so far at $177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the assertions of society on energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> At present, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief executive officer, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the introduction of the first commercial aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The leaders also reassured analysts and the media Thursday, indicating that the program was proceeding on schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> &quot;The test aircraft is not stayed on the ground longer than expected,&quot; said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the time of the plane. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Each manufacturer is planning differently. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> We had decided to proceed with a first flight and provide an update, and that is what we have done. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> This will be repeated throughout the program. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> However, analysts are sceptical that the first customer to fly a plane CSeries only 12 months after its maiden flight. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Bombardier said it was in the process of evaluating the timing of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> &quot;This slowness of flight tests - although it is apparently in line with Bombardier&apos;s internal timetable - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Mr. Doerksen. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&apos;s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents. </seg>

<seg id="1830"> &quot;In Aerospace, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions have been disappointing,&quot; said Mr. Beaudoin. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to reach $2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Bombardier, the largest rail manufacturer in the world, said that revenue from this division had risen by nearly 11% to $2.1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The order book of the Transport Division totalled $32.6 billion at September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The margins of the Transport Division suffered implementation problems on a few big contracts. </seg>

<seg id="1838"> The Kenyan press is unworthy of the controversial media law </seg>
<seg id="1839"> &quot;It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question: What will prevent Parliament to sweep the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?,&quot; said the newspaper against the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> &quot;This law is draconian and punitive, and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, general manager of Capital Group - owner of CapitalFM, one of the radio stations and Internet sites of the most respected independent news in Kenya. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> He said that the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it is an extension of the government&quot; and that the restrictions on the content and advertising would affect Kenya&apos;s place in the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> &quot;I hope the president will listen to us, and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to &quot;control the media.&quot; The Standard, for his part, said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &quot;had suffered a severe blow&quot; and criticised the bill as &quot;draconian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The adoption of the bill comes at the same time that a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate Mall last September. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack supposedly shied away from the luxury shopping centre. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by convening two journalists and a media manager for questioning, although the invitation was withdrawn after an outcry in the media. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Under the new bill, the media will be subject to fines of up to 20 million shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &quot;canceled&quot; or not being able to receive formal press accreditation. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he did not pay its fine. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even a single fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1850"> He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the &quot;lively blogosphere&quot; of Kenya. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> By reducing the media silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> &quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> &quot;Livr√©s to themselves, politicians would put the country into bankruptcy and would take us back to hunting and gathering.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Kenyan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past. </seg>

<seg id="1868"> An inhabitant of Aubervilliers launched his Party of the suburbs </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Let us not deceive ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the &quot;Party of the suburbs&quot; does not apply only to commuters. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> I chose a map of France as a logo, justifies it. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> When I speak of the suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the national family. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighbourhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> My proposal No. 1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years ago, committed territorial claims today as &quot;100% apolitical&quot; even if he has not always been neutral. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> An activist in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chev√©nement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right people are willing to support me, I will listen to them, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> There is only the extremist parties that I am not. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme -consultable Internet- based on many topics expected to talk to people in suburbs and especially to young people: The right to vote for foreigners, the legalisation of cannabis, civil majority in 16 years, the rehabilitation of the guardian of building... </seg>
<seg id="1880"> It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene &quot;for the municipal elections in 2014, it is likely to be fair,&quot; he says. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1881"> It is a problem of time and money. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The Party of the suburb should still be represented at Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures already have seven heads the list in mainland France and Martinique. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> &quot;And the messages of support I receive since yesterday did not come all of the suburbs,&quot; he says. </seg>

<seg id="1888"> The foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a test &quot;authenticity&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a test &quot;authenticity&quot; for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while he plans to extend the crackdown. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> The test, if adopted, would be applied as a criterion intended to prevent the use of 457 visas for unskilled jobs or as a roundabout way to bring his family and friends in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> A working paper from the government was unveiled today as the Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the government&apos;s speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend the neighbours of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;The sensational declarations on&quot; foreigners returning at the end of the queue &quot;and&quot; jobs for Australians first &quot;is an unpleasant return at a time when unions demanded a protected labour market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Historically, this meant that the work of the whites should be protected - and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see as an echo in this historical artifact. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The working paper reported the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> The Immigration Minister Brendan O&apos;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss the trafficking of human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> If the &quot;authenticity&quot; criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be controlled to know &quot;if the job offer is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds. </seg>

<seg id="1901"> Challenging of the right to abortion in Texas </seg>
<seg id="1902"> A Federal Court of Appeal reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to abortion that had been blocked by a trial judge this week. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will carry out abortions should have a &quot;privilege of admission&quot; to local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of its status as a member of a hospital care, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center to issue a diagnosis or treatment. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Defenders of abortion argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state&apos;s clinics because these clinics have failed to achieve this &quot;privilege of admission&quot; for their practitioners. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> On Monday, a judge of first instance ruled on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> But the Attorney General of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who is vying for the post of governor, asked the appeals court to annul the trial ruling that blocked the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> A full hearing on the matter is scheduled for the month of January. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Oracle shareholders angered by the salary of Ellison </seg>
<seg id="1912"> A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposal to pay for the founder and CEO Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> The vote is not binding but is tarnishing the image of Larry Ellison, Third World fortune just topped the victory of his boat in the America&apos;s Cup. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> Last year, Ellison had suffered a negative vote on its remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The boss of Oracle has waived a bonus of $1.2 million for fiscal year 2013 ended in May because of the poor performance of the group, which has failed to achieve its growth objectives, but he has collected about $77 million related to stock options. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Its fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> On the whole exercise d√©cal√© 2013, Oracle net income grew by 3.5%, while the course of stock markets jumped 27.5%, letting me go around the S &amp; P-500, which took 24% in the same time. </seg>

<seg id="1924"> This pornographic drama queen, eight chapters which will be released in two parts (1 and 8 January 2014), the erotic memories of a man addicted to sex since his teens. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> The likeness of Stacy Martin with his eldest is striking: A silhouette of twig, a diaphanous complexion and English-French origins. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Not to mention a certain risk appetite: Those who did not hesitate to pose naked on the glossy paper will appear in situations far more sulfur on the big screen. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> An excerpt of Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> If the provocative filmmaker asked his players to put their modesty in the closet, he has resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all digitally body: Above the belt, is the star; below, the liner. </seg>

<seg id="1930"> Stacy Martin did not finish to talk about it. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> There are five years ago that my father was erased from the world of the living. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> At the beginning I denied his death, I spoke to him in the present. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> I was so afraid of the forgotten or rather I didn&apos;t know how I was going to continue to &quot;attend.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1934"> There is no recipe, instructions from the wall of the invisible and regain its own. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Then signs have emerged. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> The first time was the very strong sense of its presence on the passenger seat while I was driving. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch its shows that leaves me more, put on the table at night. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> That is the image of my father smiling accompanying me in my day-to-day actions. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Our mother died after exhausting his fight against cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> At least, that is what I thought when I found her body empty, unloads on the hospital bed in crumpled linen. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Similarly, his funeral was a frigid farewell focused around the meagre light candles that framed his coffin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> I thought that it was a party. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> Gradually, in small diurnal and nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned in my mind, as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thinking that is believed in mourning. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And then, it turned out, while revealing my own facets to me that I had not yet seen, masked by my relationship with her. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> So I learned and understood that I did not lose the person of my mother, but simply a woman that I didn&apos;t know really, a woman who embodied this person, during his stay in life. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> In dying, this woman had perfect his life and released the person that I liked, and here is that I found myself, fully. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> The detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> It is a privilege to know that people loved will never leave us. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> I like my father, &quot;inside and outside&quot; apparently. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> I was always told me. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> I never thought at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> I have had a difficult relationship with him until he becomes old, sick. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Here, I no longer afraid of him and I was able to love it. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> One day, he is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> For a long time, he accompanied me: When I stopped smoking, when I was afraid when I was wrong... </seg>
<seg id="1956"> He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I saw his hands while watching mine, I am my body. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> But it was never indiscreet. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> I was able to have a personal life. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> He left me my privacy. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> It lasted a long time and then one day he is gone. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> I don&apos;t know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> My parents are no longer but I constantly feel close to me. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Each event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer: What would they say? What would they have thought? Auraient- that they do? </seg>
<seg id="1966"> I always dream of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> I often dream of the last moments that I must share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from doing this time. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> I wake up often anguished when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Sometimes, some dreams lead me to the opposite and part of my history and effectively, they continue to live and to share my life. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, I hissais out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the level and I smiled and looked forward to wait a little boy. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with joy what was happening to me. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> And, of course, it was a little boy in my belly. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> I liked to share this moment with him, and I am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> There are just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> A year ago, she was travelling with my family in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused among the youngster that I was at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> Nevertheless, I realized my grief quickly enough. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> But it continues to influence my life, especially in the moments when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> Learn Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of a master&apos;s degree in high school, were not, with hindsight, harmless choices. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The values she taught me are always present, so that I happen to think about how she would like me to act at any given time. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the goodness and generosity of spirit of that was a fervent believer. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Now, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a spirit of salvation. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> I see his eyes arise on me. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> My mother died there are nineteen years now. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Dead after having spoken on the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> I went through all phases: Incomprehension, anger, pain, the tears that activate alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Then, the time has eased the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> It remained that lack, this vacuum unanswered, the need for it, give me, to reassure me at the bottom of its sweetness. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Yet it is there, silent presence, it is here and looks at me. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Every morning, I see his eyes worried arise on me, I see the rings to reduce his eyes, wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, wrinkles in the forehead days of concern. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> And every morning, I diverts the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 years. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> It feels its protection, nothing serious can happen to us. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> It was his promise on his bed of pain, then it was slowly relearned to smile, and his name is no longer taboo, but comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Of course, I talk to him in the palm of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites in my dreams when morale is a little achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the passage of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we are trying to stay in the way that it had drawn. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> If you liked to be very strong, can you tear the heart and memories. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> In some ways, the loved one becomes your inner energy. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> I lost my father on 22 August 2008 cancer of asbestos. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> I was very close to him, I have always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> I have not been able to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a boy. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his own, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> I also had problems in my work for these beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what they think. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> I don&apos;t know if I have adopted its way to be or if I&apos;m just like him: Is it genetic? </seg>
<seg id="2008"> In any event, it will always be my reference. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk among us. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> In short, it is on a daily basis. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> I feel his presence, and it makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> That is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33 years. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> I was 28 years old and our son 6 years. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> The sorrow that I then invaded was attenuated, of course, but it is always close to me. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Very often it &quot;landed&quot; in my dreams so precise, if alive until the clock I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, I would say, &quot;I&apos;m going,&quot; but one vote so real that I woke up with a jolt, anxious and I lit the lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> I still live in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I returned to see if he is not there, I know it&apos;s him and I talk to him. </seg>

<seg id="2103"> Pitcairn wants to create the world&apos;s largest marine reserve </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Pitcairn Island wants to create the world&apos;s largest marine reserve, announced Thursday, the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, citing information from Radio Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This island, to the east of the Gambier Islands, French Polynesia, is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> It is the UK since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, episode in the history of the English navy which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> A few dozen people, most of them descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of the generosity of London. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The Island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836.000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> The project must be accepted by the Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to secure these 836.000 km2, but to have the means to monitor, which is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> There is no airport in Pitcairn, making it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where placing monitoring military ships. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> As for France, it must already lead the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million square kilometres of the EEZ of French Polynesia, close to Pitcairn. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Greece: Two people died in a shooting near a local neo-Nazi party </seg>
<seg id="2117"> Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday evening by shots fired by two people who were aboard a motorcycle that passed in front of a room of the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn in the western outskirts of Athens, a police source. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> The police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation. </seg>

<seg id="2121"> Officers from the counter-terrorism unit were dispatched to the Central Avenue of the suburbs Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and have cordoned off the area. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for involvement in a &quot;criminal organization&quot; in the context of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> The parents of a Georgia teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered </seg>
<seg id="2124"> The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a rolled wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his school, believe that their son was murdered, said the family&apos;s lawyer on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, stuck in a carpet supported standing behind the bleachers in the gymnasium of the school. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Investigators of the Lowndes County sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy contests these conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> &quot;They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> They never thought that he was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> &quot;They think that it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense,&quot; said Crump. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> They are convinced that these findings were delivered in order to cover the person or persons responsible for the death of their son. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> &quot;They have sent their son to school with a binder and they made in a body bag,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that it was conducting a formal investigation into the death of Johnson, pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> What is the cause of death? </seg>
<seg id="2134"> His death is the result of a criminal act? </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> I will follow the facts, wherever they lead. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> My goal is to discover the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> &quot;I believe that there is a sufficient basis&quot; to open a formal investigation, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of &quot;positional asphyxiation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2140"> However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> &quot;Several issues still deserve an answer or a confirmation,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson, he will ask the FBI to conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> The representative of the office of the Lowndes County Sheriff was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> A judge of South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance recordings that investigators had examined. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video images contain clues about the circumstances of his death. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery </seg>
<seg id="2147"> M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without his whereabouts are never found, has in fact been buried in a mass grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> M√ºller did not survive the end of the war. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> &quot;His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte,&quot; he assured the daily newspaper based on archival documents. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would address one of the great enigmas of the Post-War. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> The German secret service, the BND, as well as in the summer of 1949, M√ºller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> The secret services were wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> &quot;From August 1945, the M√ºller&apos;s body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Department of the Reich Aviation by a commando,&quot; according to Mr. Tuchel. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> He was wearing a general&apos;s uniform. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2155"> &quot;In the inner pocket left included his service with a photo,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> Bild also publishes a document from the mayor of the district of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> That one of the most brutal sadistic Nazis is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormity of bad taste. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> &quot;It grossly crowd foot the memory of the victims,&quot; he protested in the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Heinrich M√ºller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich, who have never been caught. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He took part in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, who decided to the &quot;final solution&quot; and was particularly under his command Adolf Eichmann, head of the &quot;logistics&quot; of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Egypt asks the first freely elected president to swear </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mohamed Morsi took the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflict in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he took the oath of office for the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mr Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> He was sworn in front of the 18 judges in the Court&apos;s black dress with a building located on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> &quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and brutally suppressed by successive governments. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building where Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to cheer the new president, and departing presidential pomp of Mubarak, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Regarded as the &quot;spare wheel&quot; Muslim Brotherhood&apos;s uncharismatic, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but to all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;Egypt today is a civil state, national, constitutional and modern,&quot; said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with woodwork where he was sworn in. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University, where he delivered his inaugural speech. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem when he started at attention. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> The Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Upon his arrival, he was greeted by chanting, &quot;The people and the army, hand in hand...&quot; intoned by thousands of people gathered in the auditorium of the university. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist groups of students in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Mr. Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, whence the uprising that ended Mubarak&apos;s authoritarian regime last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former president ousted, the dispossessed. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> But by agreeing to pay a formal oath before the Court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he bowed to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The speech by Mr Morsi in Tahrir Square was accompanied by populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> Aircraft manufacturers squabble about the width of seats, while large orders are at stake </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The dispute is raging between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow, which takes place from month. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> The conflict is about the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to passengers in economy class - which are not always the most courted by the airlines, but that the allocated space is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the last aircraft made by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> This week, Airbus has called on the aviation industry to establish a standard imposing a siege size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing said that it should be up to the airlines to decide. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> The dispute broke out while the aircraft manufacturers are seeking to sell even larger versions of their long-haul twin-engine aircraft, hoping perhaps a record of orders at the event, which will take place from 17 to 21 November. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The way the seats will be willing to the rear of the plane - in particular, will there be 9 or 10 seats in front - is essential to the economic performance of the &quot;mini-jumbo segment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Boeing said that his &quot;revamped&quot; 777X will accommodate economy class 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Airbus says the A350 will carry competing version of its economy class 350 people in 18 inches wide seats configured in rows of 9. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The aviation giants often exchanged blows on technical issues by advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> It was recently able to see what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled &quot;Do you accept that?.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2192"> &quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats in the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus commercial director. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As the eating habits are changing, people grow, but the seats on planes have not changed dramatically. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo has defined the modern long-haul trip, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The circumference of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the American health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Airbus said that his rival clings to a concept of siege that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly christened &quot;jet set&quot; was more closely. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Airbus says that it has commissioned a study indicating that a boost in the width of seats would improve sleep quality of 53%. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Boeing disputed Airbus figures in relation to the width of seats and says that it is not manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance ticket prices and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> He also said that the study shows that the experience in the cabin depends not only on the width of the seats. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> &quot;This is really to offer flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities,&quot; said Kent Walld R. Regional variation, in charge of the passenger satisfaction among Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> They do not want to be told what will allow them to be profitable. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> They know their business better than anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> For passengers, it is better to have some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion in market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Airbus and Boeing both claim a yield per seat in their latest models of long-haul twin-20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> The performance announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a model 777 of origin configured in rows of 9. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row currently in service. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> &quot;Boeing is it to squeeze more seats and make its planes more competitive in relation to our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, director of Passenger Comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers were in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,&quot; said the cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Airbus and Boeing does not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers including the airlines must choose. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> The sellers of planes that circle the world prevail even with them a metre to verify the competing configurations. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> While extolling to offer comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Airbus offers a A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicated that he has not yet sold. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider aisle seats on some of its planes. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern equipment, experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the aviation industry in order to establish a standard size for the seats to succeed, but that it could overshadow the wave of sales of 777X. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> By Guillaume Nicloux adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a painstaking reconstruction of time, but it is also more difficult than it should be. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent in a convent by his family. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> When she is rebellious, she faces the cruelty of a Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The film never remits in the prurience and sensationalism, and that is the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The musical comedy, this beast of </seg>
<seg id="2224"> Classics, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung productions and fledging measurment. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After Broadway and London, Paris has finally found his voice. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> It is a revolution: The French musical asserts itself as a kind of success. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> For a long time, Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts to procurement ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> And the successes such as Cabaret or Les Mis√©rables wore the halo of the mystery. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch√¢telet and Stage ¬≠ ¬≠ Entertainment in Mogador has changed the equation. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Today, these two scenes handle titles such as tubes to success. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The first resumed, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announced for the following the world premiere of &quot;An American in Paris.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2232"> At Mogador, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; could well be one of the success of the season. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the other scenes, the musical performances as &quot;1789,&quot; &quot;Bastille&quot; lovers and small musicals as &quot;Disco&quot; or &quot;Life and Times&quot; match the success and quality. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Patrick Niedo, author of the book &quot;Stories of musicals&quot; and lecturer at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, analyzes the reasons for the hard-won success. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> How are the French musicals? </seg>
<seg id="2236"> The offer has increased. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> First, there is the &quot;evolving&quot; musical performances at the discretion of producers... </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Some use of ¬≠ beautiful projections of images and a ¬≠ real story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Others made a leap of fifteen years ago under the pretext that it can be used almost ¬≠ anything when it was Matt Pokora ¬≠ as headliners. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> After, it was musicals with the ¬≠ sumptuous du Ch√¢telet productions that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest ¬≠ living composer. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Stage ¬≠ Entertainment popularized Anglo-Saxon musicals variety adapting them in French. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The independent French producers are trying a ¬≠ ¬≠ breakthrough. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> But ongoing projects such as &quot;Rent,&quot; &quot;The Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; or &quot;The Awakening of the ¬≠ spring&quot; are struggling to be funded. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Do we have enough artists capable as Broadway singer, play and dance? </seg>
<seg id="2245"> In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it is a great year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> We have 200 talented artists who are turning projects in projects. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> In the US, the cradle of the musical comedy, it is very different. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The young people are trained in these trades in many schools. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> There are many jobs between the regional theatres, touring Broadway, off-Broadway... </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The pool of talent is also a result that the number of vacancies. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Why the tours in the province have so successful? </seg>
<seg id="2252"> With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor relation of culture in France. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Few theatre tour and it is often the ¬≠ theatre of adult Boulevard and not for young adults. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> The musical performances fill this ¬≠ lack. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> These are the same people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars... </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Propose beautiful talented young men (often) of a musical performance, it is the assurance of a craze for these young girls and often their entire family. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The Facebook pages of these performances are cleverly ¬≠ held by professionals who respond to questions. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province. </seg>

<seg id="2266"> Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker </seg>
<seg id="2267"> One could say that the city of New York is the birthplace of the stand-up in America: There are almost 100 years, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public, the tone of the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Innovation of Fay has continued over the years, to be resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of stand-up Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and major theatres. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> &quot;Most of the headliners have emerged in the Carolinas, and have been a great success, until they have become too famous to play in a club,&quot; said Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> We have created this festival in order to be able to continue to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> This year&apos;s event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an evening of music and comedy for the benefit of veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> The festival has grown, just as the world of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Several of the actors involved in this year&apos;s festival went through non-traditional channels, for example by presenting performances on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (&quot;The League&quot; on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lascivious FXX chain) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> Jenny Slate participated in the show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and was part of the casting of the series &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; but it is best known for his series of viral videos &quot;Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors in the singular voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a director of film and television, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2281"> The meeting takes place at the City Hall, in the heart of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> &quot;The city is definitely in comic DNA of all the work of Larry,&quot; said Steinberg. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and said Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I&apos;ll come to live here. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway </seg>
<seg id="2285"> One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting systems, ventilation and electrical rails, was discovered. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The US authorities have described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages that they had ever seen. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> The tunnel, zigzagging over a length equivalent to almost six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which can easily conceal trucks loaded with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The tunnel was closed before the drugs are identified by passing unnoticed, said the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> The authorities have seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the court records. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage canals. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for the drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> In 2010, the authorities have found a passage of about 700 yards with tracks that started in the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, said the oversight body </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Syria has destroyed the equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the international body monitoring of chemical weapons on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline of </seg>
<seg id="2301"> November 1, set by the Hague-based organization ordering in Damascus to destroy or &quot;render inoperable&quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing toxic gases and complete the ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable designed to destroy chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer produce new chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of products and chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> The announcement was made as the fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which, according to the experts, is home to a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human toll through a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad died, including 18,678 were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> Among the dead, it also believes that 2,202 were deserters and some 5.375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> On July 25, the United Nations has estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> It has not updated that figure since. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Assad troops are fighting against the rebels, many of which are linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network, Safira for weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> The Observatory said Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors when they need to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that has persisted in tight deadlines. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> A statement by the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that his team was &quot;now satisfied to have controlled - and destroyed - any critical production declared and machines for the mixing and filling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> She added that &quot;no other inspection activity was planned for the moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> They have not been able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, said the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other sites, which have been inspected.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> It was difficult to know at first sight if the unit of Safira was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Syria has submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> &quot;I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown under the most difficult mission ever undertaken by the organization,&quot; said the organization&apos;s Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Now in its third year, the civil war pits mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales have been accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the royal commission on child sexual abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said that he &quot;had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within the organization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2331"> The Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: A YMCA employee was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case, but that he was not aware of the second. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> He also admitted that the YMCA&apos;s opening statement was inaccurate, stressing, &quot;YMCA external checks have been carried out and indicated that children&apos;s safety was a top priority for the organization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It has been demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the second worst ratings on four institutions in an audit quality of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at age 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any breach of security policy for children. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years when he worked at the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> He was sentenced to six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff to report breaches of Lord to the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> The staff members testified that they had seen some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was left alone with the children, he kept them in private, was sitting on his lap, told them he loved them and left to play with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Danielle Ockwell, which was overseen by Lord and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that she found the head of children&apos;s services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat overseeing Lord &quot;very daunting and difficult to get most of the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2341"> The Director-General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report such breaches of their supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Instead, he said that the friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, which means that they have not reported his actions. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA of New South Wales said that, for the organization, the lesson of the incident &quot;Jonathan Lord&quot; should not be &quot;reporting&quot; by the staff, and the board agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements to staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director General of the YMCA in charge of children&apos;s services, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> He said that this decision was intended to prevent contamination of evidence, but that it was &quot;an excess of zeal&quot; and that she had been poorly implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> He said that there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, control, education, training and supervision of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The hearing was adjourned until 20 December. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> A ceremony in memory of the dead cr√©matis√©s </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The P√®re Lachaise crematorium holds, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony in memory of all the dead cr√©matis√©s in his establishment, during the year. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Anne Hidalgo, Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris to attend, and then explain, at a press conference his funeral proposals. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> To follow the ceremony, click above. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> For their own funeral, more and more people are choosing cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos survey conducted on 6 and 7 September to 1009 people, instead of 47%. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> For the funeral of a relative, the opposite is true: The French prefer burial (53% compared to 47%). </seg>
<seg id="2355"> If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> In his book The Death ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the &quot;violence&quot; that constitutes cremation, for survivors. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> There are, with cremation, &quot;an act of violence against the body liked,&quot; which will be &quot;reduced to a pile of ashes&quot; in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which &quot;would accompany the stages of grief.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> There is also a &quot;symbolic violence,&quot; which is the &quot;erasure of the uniqueness and distinctive signs&quot; reduced to the &quot;anonymity&quot; from the ashes. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Why what is readily accepted in some Nordic countries and Protestants, is it still poorly lived in France? </seg>
<seg id="2360"> &quot;Because cremation is a new fact,&quot; said Marie-Fr√©d√©rique Bacqu√©, president of the Society of thanatologie and author of the book Taming death. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> She is tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to tame it. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Taming cremation, Fran√ßois Michaud N√©rard-, executive director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, provide for the deceased a dignified ceremony also that he would be entitled to burial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> The annual survey by Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> 77% of French people want one, for their families, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%). </seg>
<seg id="2365"> Now, 73% of those who chose cremation wish to organize a ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> 66% of atheists and non-believers want it too. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Crematoriums have adapted to the evolution of society. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> &quot;Over the past decade, they are trying to avoid the violence of families waiting, idly, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the release of the ashes,&quot; observes Mr. Michaud N√©rard-. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> 70% of schools now offer masters of ceremonies, which are, in the presence of the body, the ritual of welcoming the assembly, appoint the deceased, the link to others, to give meaning to his death, organize the farewell. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Is the case at the P√®re Lachaise crematorium, since 1998. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The masters of ceremonies are often people who have switched. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> There are also former Catholic priests. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> It is in this context that the P√®re Lachaise crematorium has since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invited the families of people who have been cr√©matis√©es within one year. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> The crematorium has allowed to the relay. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> Hagel criticized 9 American states to violate the gay rights </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, &quot;all military spouses are entitled to an identity card of the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with,&quot; said the Minister in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> &quot;But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex couples in the facilities of the National Guard&quot; established on their territory, he denounced, accusing them of violating federal law and the principle of equality. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many health or social services provided in these bases, or access to their stores. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> The defense secretary said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The frond of nine states began by Texas who refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texas National Guard, because of a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> He was joined in its refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior official. </seg>

<seg id="2385"> The price of oil continued to fall Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing sector gourmand electricity is being strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The price of U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving him with a decline of 5.8% for the month of October. </seg>

<seg id="2392"> This suggests that China&apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not known for two decades in the previous quarter. </seg>

<seg id="2394"> Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, which presents Danse Danse in its two new group choreography: The first inspired inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Satie&apos;s Gnossiennes. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> An evening that allows us to see all the prism of Chouinard, art to the tics and ink-black to white. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> A white screen serves as a substantive wall. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> On the carpet, also white, in the vast space that is the Th√©√¢tre Maisonneuve, in advance, profile, end as a line and dressed in black, a body. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The body, stroke, takes its shape. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> And this form will be that of the entire room: A pleasing combination of physical imitations of drawings. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, expect from each side of the playground, rush when the next script appears, embody, stand out. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> This black-and-white game of Henri Michaux is relay of solos, group in unison (a mass that makes solo), large group of twelve solos where everyone carries out its sign. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> It is believed to &quot;Morning Glory,&quot; where, solo, Chouinard was conducting a series of written choreographic tasks on cartels, posed online at the forefront. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> It is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The energy is high, the pace always. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> There will be split when Carol Prieur took refuge under the carpet dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety and restraint, a part of the poem by Michaux, monotonous and boring in the auction, and continue dancing. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> And the music departed, and the sequence to resume. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> This sound discharge and energetic, long, if that is possible, eventually muffle and dull. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> As is also the regularity of the visual rhythm. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> There are some nice flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those which √©bouriffent hair or black fabrics that prolong the lines. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> But the lack of choreographic composition. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The impression is that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, has emerged, with its tics. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The result: The bodies appear to be flat before the drawings. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The inks of Michaux, as forms of Gestalt, open a broader imagination and starvation as dance, more porous. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Only the end, negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a theatre suddenly black, relates to the magic. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> The public has loved, the welcome was warm. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> The nightlife, after the intermission, is richer. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> The scene is partly draped gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in an abandoned house. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> At the piano, dancers have rallied together to play the partitions. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Their blunders in music, moving, give a real fragility. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> On stage, spend couples in love duets, very sensual, even erotic. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Group work, small solos transitions, moving ensembles, choruses, writing is less binary. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> There are buffoons, also familiar with Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in male-female love parades highly polarized. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The love are predators, obfuscation or players. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The gesture, laughter and squeaks beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of bodies in coitus, people who are based. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> But the piece takes its real flight after the salvation. </seg>
<seg id="2428"> A clown is on the scene when the public leaves. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> Here, everything becomes possible: The fourth wall falls, the universe explored overlap, the dancers cabotinent, are among the spectators, pontificate here, smoke, bypass, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a carefully calculated that remains sensual disorder. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The joy and madness sweat, and that is the art of Chouinard, then, to contaminate the public. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> A major fire in a </seg>
<seg id="2432"> A fire severely damaged a trade in the borough of LaSalle, in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> The emergency services were called to 1h, Friday, due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Avenue Dollard, near the intersection with R√©jane Street. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to control the blaze. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The fire had &quot;caused significant damage to the structure of the building,&quot; said the head of the Security Service in Montreal fire, Richard Bordeaux. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> There were no injuries, but almost twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Red Cross has been requested, because the residents of one of the apartments may need to be housed temporarily, said the SIM. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Report: The Obama campaign considered dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have envisaged in the greatest secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, according to the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and said Thursday evening that the president&apos;s close aides had carried out &quot;extensive work in groups and surveys in late 2011&quot; to see if the eviction of Biden could help Obama for his re-election, while his hopes were drying up. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, designed to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-president by the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the campaign headquarters in Chicago and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Only a half-dozen close aides of the president - including Daley, the former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the change was under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> &quot;Double Down&quot; indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship,&quot; before eventually deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot;did not improve significantly the chances of success of Obama.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> &quot;I said that I had discussed a wide range of issues, and this was one of them,&quot; said Daley at the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we said, &quot;Lord, what can we do?.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2450"> While Daley described the review of &quot;concerted,&quot; Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to discover whether the change would benefit at the polls. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;The campaigns don&apos;t spend a lot of money on surveys and focus groups unless they are seriously considering to take action,&quot; said Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> However, it is unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible reshuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> While Daley has said he did not think that the president &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; did not definitively to the question of whether political polls had arrived on the desk of Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden&apos;s presidential list was examined. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> &quot;Maybe,&quot; said Martin. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> David Bowie: Four listening in </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The English musician has not finished surprise this year. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Four have already emerged on the Web. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> The announcement of the release of a new album of David Bowie had left everyone stunned. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> On the day of his 66th birthday, on 8 January 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, date of 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that you could still count on him to make the glittering pop scene. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> A feast for his fans </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> The Thin White Duke has planned to repeat this album, on 4 November. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> For the occasion, he has concocted a feast for his fans. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three discs: The original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already disclosed. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles from the original album: The three pieces of the deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> David Bowie has also made presentations of this beautiful box in a video. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: Photos and exclusive kits, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics... </seg>
<seg id="2473"> And, most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a rock electricity carefully controlled. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> The unpublished already listening </seg>
<seg id="2475"> But Atomica is not the only way to reveal its charms. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> The Inform, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The Inform is double-face: An ominous intro before a cavalcade of light that slows gradually to give way to a pop ballad. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie he wanted to make a brief reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity? </seg>
<seg id="2479"> With this cheery title, the singer appears in any case in his element when he no longer had their feet on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Space Oddity, alongside, was much more serious. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> At Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again made reference to its strangeness: It would come from another planet? </seg>
<seg id="2482"> The guitar riffs, haunting, want to leave the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Bowie fun in any case to play the chameleon with these titles: In turn informant, a man aboard a rocket, Martian potential... </seg>
<seg id="2484"> It hides and reveals both plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, particularly with his characters Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> No wonder what he was therefore a mask in the hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, the brand Louis Vuitton, which he embodies the new face. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> He will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> A bird hoisted a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A bird, hoisted after he was found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into the wild. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> It has raised the death rattle of water aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was restored by the Scottish SPCA&apos;s rescue centre of Alloa. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: &quot;The death rattle of water was probably a migratory wintering who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of high winds in the North Sea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> It seems that the bird exhausted would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> He added: &quot;He was unable to fly again, so we have been contacted to help.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2493"> The death rattle of water was in good health when he was released. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV </seg>
<seg id="2495"> Subscribers to Cogeco Cable may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in a future that does not seem so distant. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> The subsidiary Cogeco said Thursday that it was conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> &quot;This will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options,&quot; explained the President and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Cogeco Cable is thus in step with its competitors, such as Bell, even though the subsidiary Cogeco does not yet have a precise date with respect to this new platform. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> &quot;You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,&quot; said Mr. Audet. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The ultimate goal is to provide the tools that our clients do not have access. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not named, could be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In the US, the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable companies so that its service is available via their distribution platforms. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne on 16 October last year. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> Ottawa wants to force the providers of cable and satellite TV to provide customers with the ability to pay for the services. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;It&apos;s been about two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages of channels, it doesn&apos;t work,&quot; said Mr. Audet. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> He hoped, however, that the consultations undertaken by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> &quot;It will emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television,&quot; said the CEO of Cogeco. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The CRTC is consulting with the public since last week, and they should continue with industry next spring. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> On the side of the results, Cogeco said have recorded a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents per share. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is a decrease compared to net income of $44.9 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> The Montreal-based company said this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> Cogeco acquired in 2012 the cable company Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, to 1.36 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> It was the first major acquisition of the company after it had failed in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet service provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> With respect to income from Cogeco, they have grown by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to $504.7 million. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable was 43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from $45.7 million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Revenue from Cogeco Cable, however, have increased by 45% to $470.4 million. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> The company has lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of customers from Cogeco Cable is increasing 5546. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Mr. Audet is not concerned to see the number of customers fluctuate so. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, &quot;he observed. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> It varies from one quarter to the next with fierce competition. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Alexei Miller, Gazprom said that the pipeline from Bulgaria heralds a new era of gas </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the large-scale project, the largest in Europe,&quot; said Alexei Miller, the chief executive of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> South Stream is expected to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, which handles the bulk of Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the risk level compared to conventional channels, &quot;says the director. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Bulgarian consumers will receive the South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project will be implemented in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Gazprom said that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Strangers are on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Strangers hooded opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without any casualties as a result of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, the Police General Abdel Latif. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The attack comes at a time when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppresses in blood manifestations of his supporters. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> The schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="2539"> In the context of English literature courses, students will have to consider at least a play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> The review will also present &quot;new texts&quot; to encourage a more diverse reading. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> A combination of literature and English language courses will be deleted. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> From 2015, students will have to pass a language GCSE independent, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The Department of Education must publish tomorrow its new programs of English and maths - the first materials to undergo a radical revision. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> He will undertake changes in other basic materials next year. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Moreover, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil an overhaul of the GCSE structure, with a new scoring system and fewer courses. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Minister, said that there was a &quot;broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting that the GCSE would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> In comparison, the Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore are about 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Although there is no formal obligation to devote more time to the maths, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE maths deepened - as well as a greater emphasis to substances contained in the international rankings - is likely to encourage schools to ensure more hours. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> The program will put more emphasis on the &quot;real-world problems,&quot; including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The European elite is ready to do business with Britain? </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses and to define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> To do this, we commissioned the survey the broadest and most complete with British business leaders and have asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of all sizes of firms, sectors and regions of Britain. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> We discovered that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and expanding while the EU states are stagnant. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> They want to see the government give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reform of the European institutional arcana. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When asked their opinion on specific political issues - ranging from the regulation of monopolies to laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competences should go back in the hands of Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> The single market has caused a general discontent, saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits to be part of the European trading area - 40% of big business, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agree. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Finally, and what is more telling, our business survey showed that a significant majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favour of a change of the treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> This conclusion, which is found in all the major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a &quot;significant change&quot; that restores the power in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The stakes are high - to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would see a shift of 16% of the votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Prime Minister should not doubt for one moment: This survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain&apos;s membership in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> It also shows that companies are hoping that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the eurozone is committed towards a closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The priority has to be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our investigation show, for businesses that means putting renewed emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Beijing involves a Turkmen Islamic movement </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;The support behind the scenes at the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, based in West and Central Asia,&quot; said the boss of the Chinese security bodies to a television channel in Hong Kong, according to a video posted online Thursday evening on a website. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> This is the first time that a Chinese official refers to a particular organization after the attack on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs from one family of the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, which borders several Central Asian countries, have hastened their car loaded with jerry cans of gasoline against the entry of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 wounded. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> The driver of the car, his wife and his mother perished in the fire of the car. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The ETIM, who said fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, former Chinese name of Xinjiang, has been classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as being responsible sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but his real influence is questioned by several experts. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Firefighters were called to rescue a puppy lost after being jammed at 15 m above the ground on an unstable ledge in a career </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Ruby, a cocker Spaniel, had escaped after a minor traffic accident </seg>
<seg id="2577"> She was found three days later by a person walking his dog stuck in the career </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Firefighters took rappel along the cliff to recover the bitch and save it from certain death </seg>
<seg id="2579"> A puppy was fortunate to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve it safely while he was perched at 15 m above the ground on the unstable cliff ledge. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker Spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for only three days before being rescued in a career on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 years ago, went to the career of Flappit in Denholme, in West Yorkshire, Ruby and thanked the Fire and Rescue Service in West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> They had searched desperately their lost dog and launched an appeal on the social networking sites after she disappeared in the career after a minor accident. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Around 2.15pm on Wednesday, a person at the sight sharpened walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the career, stuck at 15 m above the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> A team of technical assistance from the fire station in Cleckheaton has run on the scene and dropped in reminder to save Ruby using a stretcher for animals to carry up to the top of the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> The technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: &quot;She was in a precarious situation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2586"> She was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m above the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> It did not budged during the rescue - she was frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> But it goes well now. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> She ate cookies after. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> It was a very unusual appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> It is unbelievable that someone has noticed the dog. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The technical assistance specialist Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby was very fortunate to be alive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2593"> It could have been seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Ruby was taken to the vet for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: &quot;I was terrified by observing the relief.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I did not initially believed that she was up there. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It was surprising to have him again in the arm. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had fainted, it would probably be dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Firefighters were great people. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> What they did was really brave. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> They are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> Mr. Alderson, Keighley, added: &quot;It was feared that it falls, but it has not moved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The firefighters were super. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> I can&apos;t believe that she was up there. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy </seg>
<seg id="2606"> The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s downgraded the credit rating on Friday of Ukraine, questioning the ability of the ex-Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The note of the country&apos;s public debt rises to &quot;B-&quot;, venturing into the category of speculative investments. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> She is accompanied by a negative outlook, S &amp; P seeing at least one-in-three chance that it will again be lowered within a year. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;It is increasingly unlikely that the government&apos;s strategy to ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,&quot; says the American agency. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The agency notes that Ukraine&apos;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> These reserves, which the authorities have used heavily to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency is increasingly likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Kiev also needs cash to pay its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay an invoice of 882 million. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of heightened tensions with its Russian neighbour, furious at Kiev&apos;s desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> She was released in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country&apos;s economy had suffered between July and September, its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Its debt, still relatively modest, exploded in recent years and the S &amp; P estimated at 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> The country, budget deficit, for months calls for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which had given him in 2010 a credit of $15.3 billion and has released so far only 3.4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> But the Fund refuses to make any new tranche until the country has not passed unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including increasing gas prices to the population. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> At the end of a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that &quot;the large external financing needs&quot; constituted &quot;a vulnerability,&quot; while noting &quot;signs of economic improvement.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2620"> However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Political Studies, &quot;we cannot expect an improvement in the short term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2621"> &quot;There is little hope that unpopular reforms are undertaken in a pre-election year,&quot; the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015, notes the expert, interviewed by AFP. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> The only hope is an improvement of the international situation. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> S &amp; P also notes the &quot;uncertainty&quot; related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, that Brussels conditions for the release of the opponent Yulia Tymoshenko. </seg>
<seg id="2624"> &quot;Signing the agreement would be positive for the long-term trade but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium terms related to the reaction of Russia,&quot; said S &amp; P, which fears of &quot;trade restrictions&quot; on the part of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> Russia, which accounts for a quarter of the Ukrainian exports, warned that if the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> Singapore&apos;s pawnshops benefit of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts </seg>
<seg id="2627"> In a pawnbroker Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga tabled a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay school fees for his daughters. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> &quot;My husband and I have just bought a house, therefore all my money is gone inside,&quot; said Ms. Amirthalinga. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Although she earns $3,000 Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> In fact, the demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she conducted its transaction, this week became the third loan company on a pledge to be introduced at the Singapore Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> To guarantee jewelry is not only a quick way to obtain cash - $1,300 in Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> In general, the Singapore pawnbrokers levy an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans more quickly than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers while families are feeling the pressure exerted by the rising cost of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the cheap credit fuelled by lax monetary policy in the advanced economies, the low and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to bridge the difference, while their economies are experiencing a slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> This week, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s cited the growing debt burden of households, due mainly to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio of household debt to gross domestic product, the highest in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while the rate stood at 60% in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of this week of a technical recession. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom of the wage scale [] seek to supplement their income as they can,&quot; said Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The historically high price of gold over the past two years have made that people were quick to pledge their belongings to reach the cash value of their jewelry. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> In Singapore, about 70% of articles pledged in the 200 pawnshops in the city-state are in gold. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> People say, &quot;the gold price is high, let us pledge the gold chain grandmother and it will return the search for the next month.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> The increase is such in pawning that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other boutiques like this one in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where he already has four shops - but also outside of Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, its general manager. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million Singapore that it has raised this week in his introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> While some lenders at reduced rates were criticised for exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it does not increase the debt directly. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> &quot;Customers mortgage assets that they already have, and to monetize their personal property does not increase household debt,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> The pledge is socially accepted as a means to obtain a short-term financing. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> People who visit the pawnbrokers are not only those who have financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> Singapore&apos;s affluent people also go in the pawnshops ValueMax for pawning gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of the purchase price in cash. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> We see clients from all segments of society. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> &quot;This may be the affluent people who need to borrow short-term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash requirements for a difficult hurdle,&quot; said Ms. Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> Sometimes, they just need money very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The crazed lawyer who advised a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned </seg>
<seg id="2657"> Basharat Ditta, 42 years, provided information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction is revealed in broad daylight </seg>
<seg id="2659"> He was sentenced to a prison term of three years by the Assize Court of Liverpool </seg>
<seg id="2660"> A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction is revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough on investigations into its activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The lawyer, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and considered by criminals as &quot;an important issue,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with the drug trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Police officials have identified Sarborough, 32 years ago, in the process of filing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer&apos;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> Investigations revealed that Ditta was a &quot;regular customer&quot; of the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on its portfolio and its credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The four suspects were being monitored at the time by the police as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine at a cost of ¬£1.5 million, as well as more than ¬£200,000 in cash during a series of raids. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is revealed in broad daylight. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Today, the Assize Court of Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, fell in disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstructing justice after a three-week trial. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The fall of the lawyer occurred after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Two investigators have followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of Ditta and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the dustbin of counsel in a black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Shortly after the filing, Scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the football stadium at Ewood Park, Blackburn Rovers club forum. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The lawyer returned home, discovered the drugs and they are telephoned nine times. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The court heard that Ditta was a &quot;regular&quot; consumer of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in his hair, on its portfolio and its credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot;legal privilege.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2677"> During his arrest, Ditta picked up its portfolio and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they have all been seized and he took a sample of hair. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> In an interview, he said that he had an office in his home, his workplace and that sometimes customers call it home for legal issues. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were aware. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;If someone must know that we must not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Mr Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and to be too involved with individual clients. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The relationship that we are talking about is not simply a drug trafficker, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Some of its communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> But it went far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> He has impeded the investigation of the police as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Mr Ditta did not honour to his profession, but has dishonoured. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> He is too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he left compromising its independence. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Ditta has denied any wrongdoing and said: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2689"> But after the hearing, the Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta rose from criminal criminal lawyer to himself when it began to buy drugs from criminal organizations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2690"> His addiction to cocaine has compromised forever and made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organized criminal groups who have entrusted to obtain valuable information about police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Lawyers are expected to observe the rules of the highest integrity and create a climate of trust with the public. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The unit responsible for serious and organised crime in Lancashire conducted the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstructing justice now, demonstrating its commitment to pursue the criminals to justice. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Whether this case should be a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> We will find you and you&apos;ll translate to the courts. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Scarborough himself has been jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> On its website, Ditta held a question-and-answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last invited to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate them to work. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Renault sealed in by the warning of Nissan </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Renault accuses Friday, the largest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced have fallen by almost 20% of its annual net profit forecast, traders reported. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its direction. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Several traders reported that the Renault was affected this morning by the &quot;warning.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> &quot;It is clearly a profit warning from Nissan,&quot; said an official of the trading of a Parisian dealer. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan&apos;s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from the website of Nissan. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Israeli warplanes are targeting Syria, said an official </seg>
<seg id="2706"> Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, a military official confirmed to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The official did not specify what was the target, but said that there was at least one. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> The Associated Press reported that the target was missiles Russian-made SA-125. </seg>

<seg id="2710"> The late in a house built in 1850 in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="2711"> A historic house built in 1850 was engulfed in flames in the Old City Friday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The building of four homes, located at 15 rue H√©bert, has been the subject of three alarms with the fire department. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The fire broke out at the front, but rose on all three floors of the building. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> France Voiselle, spokesman for the Fire Protection Service of Quebec, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters helped to prevent the spread of the flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for the sector of the city where the buildings are constructed closely. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The house burned housed four homes, but no tenant was on the scene at the time of the fire. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The damage was quite limited, even if the water has caused damage. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the engineers have rejected the idea of a criminal act. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> A difficult year for pharmacists </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) of Laval caused quite a stir in the direction of the Hospital of the Cit√© de la Sant√©, during the year 2012-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> As a result of multiple retirements, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department has been suffer a shortage of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> It was almost 30% of the staffing requirements, making this fiscal year &quot;very difficult,&quot; according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> However, the CSSS decided not to hire independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a pharmacist hired full time. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> It has not resorted to the desk, &quot;said Ms. Beaudet. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> It has streamlined or reduced some of our activities inside the institution for level, the time that things would sort themselves out. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> It is sure that it has worked hard to get our young people [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> There is a combination of circumstances that made that we were in a bad situation last year. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> Situation improved </seg>
<seg id="2728"> After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 will be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists were hired in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> In addition, the department&apos;s efforts to retain have borne fruit, because the four students currently in residence at Laval have also decided to stay on the job of the CSSS. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Now, we&apos;re doing much better, &quot;said the pharmacist. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> This will therefore fill our departures from last year. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Ever growing needs </seg>
<seg id="2735"> The situation remains delicate. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 are difficult to predict. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> For us [the numbers] is still precarious, because it was an environment that is young and it employs many young women, therefore with pregnancy, it is almost always three maternity leave when it goes well, she added. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The last year, we had a lot more and there was no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> The FAA eases restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on planes - but it will always be forbidden to make calls on mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The fighter jets attacked a stock of Russian missiles in the port city of Latakia, an official said. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> This is apparently the continuation of the Israeli campaign aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons in the Middle East. </seg>

<seg id="2744"> Experts say that the violence that caused the death of 14 adults and seven children is nothing more than an unfortunate accident, and not a sign of an escalation of violence in America. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Instead of being destabilized by the shutdown of government activities in the United States, investors remained focused on what is probably the most important: The Federal Reserve. </seg>

<seg id="2750"> Anger provoked by the sentence against one of the Bali bombers </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> He could be released after 15 years on parole. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and left many injured. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> He was also convicted of many other counts in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of life imprisonment, yet they could request that the man, described as &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, is sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost both his 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators almost 10 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> On the verge of tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> I really think that he should have followed the same path as other men. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> &quot;It should be dragged before the squad,&quot; said Ms. Corteen the PAA. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or see my daughters. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Peter Hughes was at Paddy&apos;s Bar, when a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives barely 20 seconds earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> He fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and it is &quot;dead&quot; three times while he was on life support. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Mr Hughes said that Patek would have had to suffer the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before others. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The keep alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Spending 20 years in prison after having killed 202 people and injured hundreds of others, it is not very much. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;It has not made,&quot; said Ms. Corteen. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> Until recently, he was making a mockery out of the grief that he could cause to other people. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> &quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; said Ms. Corteen. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Patek, however, can appeal his conviction. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of its mandate, the 59-year-old man has made known its opinion on various national policies. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussion of British politics, limiting his comments to the foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet&apos;s special envoy for the peace process in the Middle East. </seg>

<seg id="2784"> But intelligence officials, the army and the militant movement said this time he had lost their lives in the strikes, carried out in the North Waziristan region. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> &quot;We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone firing,&quot; said a senior security official. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> The day before, the Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been held with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Tangle around the closure of the H√¥tel-Dieu emergencies </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Faced with the sling conducted for several months by some of the personal and several unions, including the CGT, the health minister, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to &quot;shift the timetable for implementation of the project, and in particular the emergency closure date which will not intervene on 4 November.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> A formal request made &quot;at no risk on the care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter,&quot; but also aimed not to interfere with the campaign of the Socialist Party in a few months. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Although, APHP, we prefer to use the term &quot;transformation&quot; or &quot;change in continuity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2792"> As of November 4, firefighters ¬ñ which provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages aux urgences de l&apos;H√¥tel-Dieu ¬ñ will all have instructed to take the 30 serious cases per day to emergencies other hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> At the Hotel-Dieu, the specialized domestic emergencies will end Monday to five general internal medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> With respect to the transfer of beds of internal medicine, he is scheduled for later this month. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> &quot;The reception service des urgences de l&apos;H√¥tel-Dieu must close in the shortest time, and for us, that is on November 4,&quot; says bluntly Lo√Øc Capron, president of the Medical Commission (CME) APHP, which supports the project management. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> &quot;On 4 November, there will be more patients brought by firefighters, only people from their own way,&quot; said Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new H√¥tel-Dieu. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> &quot;But we will continue to receive emergency patients,&quot; moderates, arguing the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR to transfer the serious cases. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Some senior doctors will remain in place, &quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> But it is up to the LRA to decide the closure of the emergency reception service. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> &quot;Things are gradually,&quot; said Nicolas P√©ju, spokesman for the LRA for which, on 4 November, &quot;there will be no change in terms of service.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2802"> &quot;The Minister has lied or he lied,&quot; deplores the emergency doctor G√©rald Kierzek. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> D√©mis from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for conducting the sling against the proposed reorganization, it is defined as a &quot;warning launcher&quot; facing a &quot;cynical&quot; decision taken by the &quot;medico-administrative technostructure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2804"> &quot;They are in the process of emptying and strangling emergencies that have been renovated less than five years,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> For him, &quot;if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2806"> But they are regularly congested. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> For example, there are sometimes waiting nine hours of Lariboisiere emergencies. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> At the LRA, it argues that thirty patients &quot;handled&quot; on several sites are unlikely to represent an &quot;avalanche&quot; in other emergency services, including human resources have also been strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> At the ARS as APHP, it defends the &quot;new hospital model&quot; already set in motion since 7 October and who should continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> By the end of the year, GPs Liberals should also participate in the establishment of a &quot;continuous ambulatory care.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2811"> &quot;Where are we going if we asked people to self-diagnose,&quot; wondered G√©rald Kierzek for whom the concept of emergency &quot;not serious&quot; is &quot;dangerous&quot; and marks a &quot;medical regression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This will happen as for maternity wards Level 3. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and a member of the CGT Health. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> We will be even more present in the framework of the municipal campaign and we will look to submit a list. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, conseiller UMP de Paris and elected the 4th arrondissement, clearly announced that &quot;even if the UMP Paris was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H√¥tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we go back to the responsibilities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, has reiterated Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 November. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> If that were the case, it would mark its net disagreement, &quot;said Bruno Julliard, his spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> Even if the restructuring of the H√¥tel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without a deferral scheme acceptable to other hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> You thought that travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> The company has revised its forecast for net profit to rise and hopes to record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the United Kingdom. </seg>

<seg id="2825"> The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had made eight per cent of profits in the first half and the second half started in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> &quot;Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we operate are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results on the whole of the year before deducting interest and taxes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half, which helped to offset a domestic market of business travel declined slightly. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Similarly in the United Kingdom, the leisure travel sector of Flight Centre has been performing well, while business customers spent less. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> Its U.S. subsidiary has recovered its losses in the first half when seasonal demand is weaker and had to make a profit on the whole of the year for the third consecutive time. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> Shares in Flight Centre rose 3 cents to reach $38.20 yesterday. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> General Motors Co recalled nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups through 2014 to solve a problem with the recline manually, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. agency responsible for the regulation of vehicle safety. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> On some pickups, the front seats could submit a defect at the level of the tilt mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards on the headrests. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> &quot;If the vehicle is struck from behind, it may be that the head restraint does not adequately protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury,&quot; according to the statement posted on the site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). </seg>
<seg id="2837"> The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> The deployment of the GM pickups began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> GM has informed the owners of pickups of default during the first half of October. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The agency was unable to examine the newsletter to owners because of the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which have been redesigned for the 2014 model, have increased by about 20% over the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday. </seg>

<seg id="2861"> The Pope Francis will appoint its first cardinals in February </seg>
<seg id="2862"> The Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, the Vatican announced Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The Cardinals are the men of the highest-ranking church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect, Fran√ßois will appoint its first group of men who ultimately choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> There are currently 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> However, as soon as a cardinal reached the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope - this amounts to a group of 120 cardinal electors &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2866"> In a statement announcing the new, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of a cardinal, known as the Presbytery. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> &quot;The Pope Francis decided to communicate its decision to convene the Presbytery of February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; said Lombardi. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals electors will probably have declined. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> He said that a pope appointed in general as many cardinals that he needed to ensure that the number of voters reaches 120 cardinals and cardinals older than 80 years he wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The Presbytery of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> For the moment, there is a tendency to focus on Europe, especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> 40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Fran√ßois formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to discuss ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Previously, the Pope decided alone. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;Now, Fran√ßois chose the eight cardinals to help him,&quot; said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> He added that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Fran√ßois seeks advice to the Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> But we have never experienced such a situation - it is totally new. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> Valero said that the popes were generally bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was &quot;full of surprises - so we do not know who he will appoint.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Tenants must go to vote, because all of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the city. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> When the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, it divides this amount between each dwelling. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> We are obliged to increase rents to help us to pay the new taxes. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> In voting, we are sending a clear message. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> We need to change things in the City. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> All candidates have told us that they would deal with the debt scandalous. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks to $100,000, $4 to $5 million for in case. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Go vote, it is the best way to express yourself and say that this is enough. </seg>

<seg id="2902"> And even if we are urban dwellers, it is our spiritual home. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> &quot;Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and the beauty of the world will pass to many people the tremendous joie de vivre that he had,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Lou Reed had suffered last May a liver transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> She is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine in pumpkins </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Taking advantage of the day of Halloween, a woman tried to enter the country two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins, Thursday morning at the Montr√©al-Trudeau Airport. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> It was during the examination of the passenger&apos;s baggage that the drug could be detected. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> The cocaine had been divided into three pumpkins that have been emptied. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who took over in this investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came when it was intercepted. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> It is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokesman for the CBSA. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> What I can tell you is that it was in the country. </seg>

<seg id="2915"> G√©rard de Villiers, the author of &quot;SAS,&quot; died. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> He will never have known the word retirement. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> French publishing phenomenon, G√©rard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years old, had just published its 200th SAS, &quot;The Revenge of the Kremlin.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2918"> In February, the New York Times had spent as &quot;the author of spy novels who knew too much.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He then had to spend 10 days in Afghanistan, theatre of 198 and 199es episode of the series of spy novels. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Decreased physically by a very serious cardiac event in December 2010, he was travelling during this trip with a walker. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> And before Afghanistan, he was also left in Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> With four SAS published annually, G√©rard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, was unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the release of &quot;SAS in Istanbul,&quot; the first of the series, there are almost half a century. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> &quot;Without doubt between 120 and 150 million for all countries,&quot; he argued last March. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> His Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building on the Avenue Foch throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> &quot;Without counting the pirate editions,&quot; he added, referring to a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or the ivories of 130 countries surveyed reported to situate his novels. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional coverage with a photo of a young woman in the chest advantageous, wearing a pistol or an assault rifle. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Inside, his (SAS) Most Serene Highness Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat d√©sargent√© and CIA contractor to pay for the repairs of the family castle, began to all the bad guys of the earth, communists in the 1970s and 1980s, then jihadists from the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> Each book, the same recipe: A large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of sex addict, a dash of violence and torture. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;I have never had the claim to be a literary writer,&quot; explained G√©rard de Villiers. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I did not send a message. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He worked &quot;as the major pre-war reporters, such as Albert London, who went on the spot and returned with real and lengthy investigations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2932"> The father of SAS said &quot;make a kind of geopolitical soap opera.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2933"> &quot;I am constantly my records (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before you go,&quot; added G√©rard de Villiers. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> On site, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people of services that I know for certain for 20 or 30 years. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> As a result, many of the SAS are often prescient: For example, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in &quot;The Road to Damascus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In &quot;Les Fous in Benghazi,&quot; he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command centre of the CIA in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> In 1980, he depicted the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Cairo &quot;The plot,&quot; a year before the attack. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> In October 2012, in &quot;Panic in Bamako,&quot; he told the 4x4 columns of jihadists who based on the Malian capital. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> I am not a prophet, defended G√©rard de Villiers, I am simply assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Following these trips in areas often troubled, he settled for a month behind its IBM typewriter daisy dating back to 1976, &quot;all the pieces have been changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> 300 pages later, he wrote the word &quot;FIN&quot; and corrected each page in pen. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The walls of his office are hung with AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Regularly singled out for machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, G√©rard de Villiers dismissed these charges in two sentences. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Some women are sex objects in my books, but other women are beautiful, intelligent and courageous. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> I am always welcomed in Africa, where I count very many readers. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> G√©rard de Villiers said: &quot;Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2947"> He will not die and does not go into retirement. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> No more than me. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Nearly 50,000 homes are without power throughout the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to high winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River. </seg>

<seg id="2963"> &quot;The violent terrorist incident which occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,&quot; said Meng at the Hong Kong Phoenix TV channel. </seg>

<seg id="2967"> The incident has made 42 wounded. </seg>

<seg id="2970"> The project of the Minister Brigitte Grouwels &quot;difference&quot; poles of signal lights in Brussels does not please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project to repaint 16 traffic light poles in the region to the yellow and blue colors of Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> The goal is to &quot;increase security&quot; and &quot;Brussels identity.&quot; </seg>
