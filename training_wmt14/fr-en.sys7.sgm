<seg id="1"> The NSA case underscores the total lack of debate on intelligence </seg>
<seg id="2"> How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand, the public is frustrated by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and the other prohibits the overflight by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on board of Edward Snowden? </seg>
<seg id="3"> According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> When Fran√ßois Hollande phone to Barack Obama, or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius summoned the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the size of the American surveillance on all communications in France. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the Quai D&apos;orsay eavesdropping by the NSA? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Is there not as a wave of hypocrisy from you? </seg>
<seg id="7"> The journalistic process is not a moral position, but research interest and relevance of information to enable every citizen to form an opinion. </seg>
<seg id="8"> When Wikileaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy for political or other issues around the world, we believe that, in the light of American power, this is a major lighting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> When we describe the U.S. interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is in any case to be outraged at this practice is to describe the world as it is. </seg>
<seg id="10"> France has benefited from information supplied by the NSA on terrorist operations against our interests? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can we deny the American collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="12"> The establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools to intercept very powerful in the United States, but also by France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Moreover, in this field, France and the United States have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described by both sides as critical. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Washington was reported to the French thanks to the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="15"> France can be conducted, for example, to send entire blocks of data on the Sahel region of the U.S., and in exchange-already quickly said, Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So the question of substance behind the NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to develop tools to intercept, that the question of the total absence of prior debate, notably in the parliaments, the justification of such systems, which must be theirs, and, in the end, the issue of attacks on freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That is a real risk that the United States? a degradation of their image? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is fine to denounce them, I don&apos;t see how they can be punished. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The risk for the Americans can be double. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first is when their allies - and that was the case recently-learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest levels of their state, were monitored. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with diplomatic relations with the United States are strained. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Another effect can be more economical to him: as more European or South American Companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data for US contractors subject to American laws, and thus the influence of the NES. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The last element: the vast movement of revelations by the world&apos;s media, which contributes to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services of hitherto almost non-existent, could push the legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the credentials that they have given to their intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Barack Obama receives the Iraqi prime minister, in full spate of violence </seg>
<seg id="25"> The American president was to receive on Friday 1 November 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, seeking U.S. help to combat the greatest wave of violence for five years. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Iraq has experienced in October the most deadly month for five and a half years, according to figures released Friday, November 1, by the Iraqi authorities. </seg>
<seg id="27"> 964 people have died in the violence in October, whose 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers and 1,600 people were injured. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The UN provides a stock even higher with 979 deaths and 1,902 injured. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The violence is most deadly despite tightened security measures and military operations launched last month by the government of Nouri Al-maliki, dominated by Shiites. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration as neighboring Syria is engulfed in a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The bombs struck markets, mosques, weddings and funerals. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Men are killed in the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and to be the target of unjust arrests, led to the outbreak of violence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> On Friday, new violence killed four people in the north of Iraq, in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the detonation of five car bombs north of Baghdad. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Nouri al Maliki wants a &quot;global war&quot; Against Al-qaida. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The violence is at the centre of discussions in the United States the Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="39"> At the time, the American president, elected on the promise to put an end to the military engagement in the country, had painted an optimistic picture of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive and the elected members of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On Thursday, he pleaded for the international community leads a &quot;third world war&quot; Against Al-qaida. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The principle of increased aid to Iraq&apos;s security is supported by influential senators, Republicans and Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="43"> But they also criticized Nouri al Maliki, a Shiite, granting him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &quot;sectarian and authoritarian politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="44"> They also demanded President Barack Obama that he will make it clear to Nouri al Maliki that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="45"> French police stop fans of Anderlecht came only with the purple-white cars </seg>
<seg id="46"> The French police has decided to lay down strict rules on the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht against Paris saint-germain set on Tuesday, contacted Marie Verbeke, the spokesman for the bruxelles-midi police, on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The Belgian purple-white fans who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will be required to use the travel system put in place by the purple-white.. </seg>
<seg id="48"> &quot;The convoy of buses will be escorted by police from a former border post of Rekem MTP stage,&quot; the spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The course will be the same for the return. </seg>
<seg id="50"> &quot;If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture reported that measures were taken to make arrests or in custody,&quot; said Marie Verbeke. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The Vatican probe on contraception, divorce and homosexuality. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The Vatican has undertaken a large survey around the world on how the parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The survey asked participants how priests are gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being married. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The survey was sent in mid-october to each National Conference of Bishops, with instructions to get the most possible answers. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The information will be used for a major rally on the family that Francis plans to hold next year. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="57"> A spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each Bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe the parishioners. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the UK, the bishops issued on Internet poll asking Catholics to participate. </seg>
<seg id="59"> The 37-year-old man who took children hostage at school in Surrey Gabrielle Roy faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Omar Mustapha Hassan was accused of hostage taking, kidnapping, uttering threats, carrying a weapon for dangerous, kidnapping, and failure to obey an order. </seg>
<seg id="61"> &quot;The quick reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion to this incident,&quot; said Corporal Bert Paquet. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Omar Hassan is still in custody and will appear in court on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The new vaccine could remove the pleasure cravings to smoke </seg>
<seg id="64"> Scientists have developed a vaccine that cravings could remove the pleasure that it takes to smoke a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="65"> One dose of the vaccine could protect life of nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Further testing is needed before testing on humans, but Dr. Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="67"> &quot;We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,&quot; said Cornell professor. </seg>
<seg id="68"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design antibodies cravings. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The virus infects selectively liver cells, which then began to produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The antibodies are tracking all the molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have her dose of nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In tests, the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine then continued their normal activity. </seg>
<seg id="72"> But the mice that were not vaccinated &quot;abated&quot;, said the researchers, signs that the nicotine had reached their brain. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The previous vaccines against tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="75"> The injections were to be repeated so frequently that the antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="76"> But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells with antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Professor Crystal said that if the vaccine for human use was completely safe, there could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="78"> But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit. </seg>
<seg id="79"> &quot;They know that if they start smoking again, they will take no pleasure because the vaccine cravings, and it could help them lose their bad habit,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="80"> British scientists said the findings were interesting, but noted that much more research was needed. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Egyptian Islamists in the streets to denounce Morsi&apos;s trial </seg>
<seg id="82"> Anger is rising in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Two days before the opening of the trial of the deposed president Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets. </seg>
<seg id="84"> A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the reinstatement of the country&apos;s first democratically elected president. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is not a trial underlines the militant Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="86"> So far, no lawyer was able to meet and no volunteers could not make a copy of the documents of the case. </seg>
<seg id="87"> It is not a trial, this is a farce. </seg>
<seg id="88"> The trial of President Morsi is a false trial took an ordinary soldiers, he is supposed to judge Sisi, not the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Morsi must judge Sisi in the Rabaa killings, massacres of Nahda and the massacre of the Republican Guard. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Sisi is a liar and a traitor. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Clashes erupted in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="92"> On Monday, 20,000 police will be deployed in front of the police academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged. </seg>
<seg id="93"> A case of rabies detected in a cat in the val-d&apos;oise </seg>
<seg id="94"> The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the val d&apos;oise, clearly foreign, while France is free from indigenous cases since 2001. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The kitten was found on October 25 to Argenteuil and died on 28 October. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute. </seg>
<seg id="97"> &quot;An investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of the people who have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28,&quot; said the ministries of health and agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="98"> &quot;Five people who had been in contact with the kitten had already been identified&quot; and received a preventive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> &quot;In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective,&quot; said the release. </seg>
<seg id="100"> The ministries are now people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or on a worked-over mucosae or skin damaged by this kitten or that the animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. From 1 November. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;France is free of rabies since 2001, kitten or mother were imported from another country, not unscathed,&quot; according to the release. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The Ministry of Agriculture said that the last case of rabies &quot;Aboriginal&quot; identified dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that &quot;France is declared officially free of the disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="103"> A case of rabies in a dog imported illegally from Gambia had been recorded in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="104"> &quot;Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated in time,&quot; recalled the ministries and it is transmitted for about 15 days before the appearance of the first symptoms of the disease. </seg>

<seg id="110"> An Australian appealed against his sentence in Thailand </seg>
<seg id="111"> A Sydney woman, 21, was sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for having falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the sentence and was released on bail. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a court in Phuket province on June 15, false statements after he told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who had mastered, had assaulted early Sunday, June 10. </seg>
<seg id="113"> However, the video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her boyfriend, Australian. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted to having invented the story. </seg>
<seg id="115"> She was detained in a cell of the local police station before the court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Bamford was sentenced to a prison term of 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for women. </seg>
<seg id="117"> This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby league Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help her daughter. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Tunks told The Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; for the welfare of her daughter and wanted her to return to Australia. </seg>
<seg id="119"> &quot;We obviously had a scary moment, but we hope it back home safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Bamford appealed the sentence and was released after paying a deposit of 50,000 baht. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In Australia, the Press said, meanwhile, she was on holiday in Krabi, Southern Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the call could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and a jail in an adult prison. </seg>
<seg id="123"> However, after the recent murder in Phuket by Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to burnish his image deteriorated from tourists, which could lead to an acquittal. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of judicial proceedings for Nortel patents </seg>
<seg id="125"> The group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents has started an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against the manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company he headed to the pole at the auction of Patents that took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Rockstar, the consortium which acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the Assize Court of the United States in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Google is accused of violating seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Patents for technologies that can display an advertising linked to search terms on the Internet, said the outcome of the trial, which is the core business of Google. </seg>
<seg id="130"> It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC producing phones that run on Google&apos;s Android operating system, which delivers a fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Google has increased its offer several times, eventually proposing $4.4 million dinars. </seg>
<seg id="134"> After losing the Nortel deal with Rockstar, Google has subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on the library of Motorola&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="135"> &quot;Despite having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue in the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe patents,&quot; said the conclusions of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Rockstar seeks damages and interests more important to Google because he argues that Google&apos;s patent infringement is tenacious, according to the complaint. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="138"> The former New South Wales Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the anti-corruption regulator of the state. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the area controlled by the government. </seg>
<seg id="140"> On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several ministers of the state to renew its leases at Circular Quay, where Obeid has two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without a call for tender. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Now it is investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of the secret Mr Obeid&apos;s interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former deputy secretary general of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="142"> During years of discussions initiated in 2005, the Government has pushed for the leases are a call for tender. </seg>
<seg id="143"> The tenants were against and also wanted more time. </seg>
<seg id="144"> In 2009, the Company leases from Circular Quay, which pertained to Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without bidding. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Mr. Tripodi, who was minister of ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tender. </seg>
<seg id="146"> But he denied having changed its policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who has recognized Mr. Tripodi, called for a change of government policy on leases. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Transcripts of telephone conversations at the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after having worked under the orders of Obeid to the ministry of fisheries. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;The subject discussed during these telephone conversations, it was the development of the policy on commercial leases?&quot; asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I don&apos;t remember what we discussed, but in any case, it was not that. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="152"> FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not place a call using their mobile phone) </seg>
<seg id="153"> Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music-but not speak on their mobile phone-under the new long-awaited guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="154"> But passengers should not expect immediate changes. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said the FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated training manuals of crew members and rules regarding the placement of the devices to be in compliance. </seg>
<seg id="157"> The FAA said it had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Delta and Jetblue are among the companies that have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices in the very near future,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane&apos;s doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="161"> They are not supposed to reignite them before the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and that the commander gives its green light. </seg>
<seg id="162"> The passengers are supposed to put their devices in the descent of the plane before landing and not restart them until the plane landed. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings and rolling on the ground, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Most of the new planes and other aircraft that were modified so that passengers can use the Internet to higher altitudes, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said it was pleased with the changes. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Once the new policy implementation in safety - and we will work in close collaboration with carriers for that-it will be beneficial to everyone,&quot; Glading said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="167"> We are frankly tired of us feel like &quot;supervisors&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="168"> But he will always be allowed to connect to the internet to surf, exchanging emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Still no words with friends, play online Scrabble style in which the actor Alec Baldwin plays on his smartphone in 2011 when he was deported on an American Airlines flight after he refused to turn off his camera while the plane was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And the heavier devices like laptops will still be classified because it could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The regulatory power of the phones is for the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The FAA can lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="175"> Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the National Transportation Safety Board expert on CBS News, said that the phones were still seen as presenting a risk. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, they could disrupt mobile phone masts if they are used on board,&quot; Rosenker said. </seg>
<seg id="177"> An Industry Advisory Committee, established by the FAA to review the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="178"> The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to relax the restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Critics such as Senator Claire Mccaskill, D-MO.), argue that there is no security reason for these bans. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become pervasive. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Some studies suggest that at least a third of the passengers forget to turn off their appliances, or deliberately. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The FAA has started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation instruments and communication when passengers carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new jets, far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="184"> The airlines allow passengers to use wi-fi to cruising altitudes for several years. </seg>
<seg id="185"> The aircraft modified for wi-fi systems also resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The vast majority of airliners should permit a wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Today&apos;s electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of power far lower than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Readers of electronic books, for example, emit only minimum transmissions when turns a page. </seg>
<seg id="189"> But the signals are strongest when the devices to download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Amazon.com is part of those who are pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In 2011, the company&apos;s leaders on an airliner electronic book reader Kindle and flew them to see if there were problems, but there were none. </seg>
<seg id="192"> It has inspired the members of the Advisory Committee, the FAA mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices present a risk. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought that the interference from devices were real, even though the risk was minimal. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with airplane systems, and that most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="195"> However, the Board recommended that the FAA allows drivers to ask passengers to turn off their devices for instrument landings in low visibility conditions. </seg>
<seg id="196"> A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling the arrangements full of common sense for passengers equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="197"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience pleasant is not incompatible with the security,&quot; said Roger Dow, president and chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="198"> The rules on the use of electronic devices on board will remain for the time being in force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="199"> The Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite the U.S. gesture to relax rules on electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The American Federal Aviation Administration left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they are in &quot;airplane mode.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="201"> Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Australian carriers to examine the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements, but said they have no immediate intention to change their procedures. </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it considered the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight was still in force in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="204"> &quot;CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in the plane,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="205"> The issue is the subject of a regulation that requires operators of aircraft to ensure the maintenance of security at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Virgin, which has already spoken to the House of his intention to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using wi-fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the governor. </seg>
<seg id="207"> &quot;We would welcome a review by CASA, which allows the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using wi-fi technology on our aircraft,&quot; said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Qantas said it was at the moment the current rules. </seg>
<seg id="209"> &quot;According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate intention to change it,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="210"> The FAA&apos;s decision applies to American Airlines. </seg>
<seg id="211"> However, we are always interested by the regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA&apos;s decision and the reasons for it. </seg>
<seg id="212"> For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="213"> The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review the manuals, training materials, transport programme of hand luggage and the instructions provided to passengers. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;As soon as an airline has tested the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,&quot; the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="215"> In the rare case of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their appliances during the landing. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The group also recommended that heavier equipment stowed safely under the seats or in the overhead bins during take-off and landing. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The CDC publishes tips on allergies in children to schools </seg>
<seg id="218"> On Wednesday, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a set of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in children to school. </seg>
<seg id="219"> This is the first set of guidelines that the American government is publishing, since the number of school-age children with food allergies has climbed sharply. </seg>
<seg id="220"> One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="221"> The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="223"> He also recommends to schools to have a stock of epinephrine auto-injector Epipen brand - is the most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The state legislatures have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have more easily of epinephrine in stock. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Children can say, &quot;I have the impression that something irritates me the language,&quot; &quot;I feel like I have a hair on the language&quot; or &quot;I have a tingling sensation on the tongue.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="227"> Many opposed to medical help to die in Congress of palliative care </seg>
<seg id="228"> The Canadian Congress of palliative care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical help to die in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="229"> This is an opportunity for several associations of palliative care to reaffirm their disagreement. </seg>
<seg id="230"> If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Palliative Care, Maryse Bouvette.. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Emphasis on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would be minimal. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The President of the palliative care network of Quebec also rejects the draft law on medical help to die. </seg>
<seg id="233"> If it is adopted, Alberte D√©ry is concerned about the consequences for future generations. </seg>
<seg id="234"> &quot;What is the meaning of life,&quot; she lamented. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The majority of the houses of palliative care will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice-president of the Alliance of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Ms Fitzback, also director of La Maison mathieu-froment-savoie in Gatineau, believes that the Service would be useless anyway. </seg>
<seg id="237"> We will never request: &quot;I want to die, give me an injection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="238"> The Director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the draft law of Quebec misleads people about the vocation of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="239"> He does not believe that Ontario will follow. </seg>
<seg id="240"> For its part, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stephanie valley, argues that the notion of the end of life will have to be clarified before the draft law is adopted. </seg>
<seg id="241"> Halloween 2013: In figures </seg>
<seg id="242"> When I was a kid, Halloween was magical. </seg>
<seg id="243"> My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and we dress up to go to the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Today, I have become more stingy. </seg>
<seg id="245"> These last two years, I have not distributed a single sweet and I will certainly not this year. </seg>
<seg id="246"> But the stats show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="247"> The majority of Americans - 158 million of them, in fact-will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation. </seg>
<seg id="248"> What I look forward to every Halloween, what are the trends. </seg>
<seg id="249"> The costumes should represent $1.2 B on the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="250"> This year, the sexy inanimate objects are all the rage. </seg>
<seg id="251"> Women no longer need to be professional, sexy; they can also be sexy foods such as pizza, hamburgers and carrots. </seg>
<seg id="252"> For men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series &quot;The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in the area of Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year. </seg>
<seg id="253"> According to Google, the most popular costumes are the zombies, Batman, pirates and witches. </seg>
<seg id="254"> I suppose it does not hurt to remain. </seg>
<seg id="255"> We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="257"> A lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When it comes to sweets, they pile up. </seg>
<seg id="259"> The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on candy, according to the Nielsen office. </seg>
<seg id="260"> This is about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark. </seg>
<seg id="261"> It&apos;s a super news for 41 million children who go hunting for the candy in their neighbourhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. </seg>
<seg id="262"> In fact, we are going to buy and, let us be honest, consume 41 million kg of chocolate for Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="263"> The candy corn are the only thing that does not want to eat, and yet almost 16 million kg sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association. </seg>
<seg id="264"> This is about $9 billion of corn kernels. </seg>
<seg id="265"> It is a mystery that I am not yet arrived. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Nothing is more representative of the Halloween haunted houses. </seg>
<seg id="267"> They have the best names such as &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which is actually a real prison), &quot;howl-o-scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="268"> In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and that includes these wonderful pictures of you pee on you that your friends are on Facebook and you can&apos;t remove and which type you prefer to leave a &quot;pretty head.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="269"> Finally, talking of pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Charlie Brown gave us the big pumpkin when we were kids, and carve a pumpkin lantern, it&apos;s like decorating a Christmas tree-it is something one does, since it is very small. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Fortunately for us, the &quot;tendency of B√©b√©-citrouille&quot; began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have carved the pumpkins and has not had to sit inside. </seg>
<seg id="272"> This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="273"> The citrouilles-lanternes which wilt gently on the porch of the house, presumably from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins have been cultivated this year. </seg>
<seg id="274"> If you are looking to you to point out more, call Tim and Susan mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve their pumpkin 922 kg. </seg>
<seg id="275"> School transport: the admissible complaints </seg>
<seg id="276"> The school board of the R√©gion-de-sherbrooke (CSRS) calls since the beginning of the school year for a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation for two residences, a service that the organization offers when she is able to do so. </seg>
<seg id="277"> Before the changes in the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;There is a service of mediation, which is proposed by the Commission and I was interested,&quot; explains Ms. Lefevre. </seg>
<seg id="279"> According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested additional time to consider it. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It is always better to talk, to work together and find solutions,&quot; Lefevre said. </seg>
<seg id="281"> The school board of the R√©gion-de-sherbrooke (CSRS) did not want to comment. </seg>
<seg id="282"> The organization has only meant that the mediation is part of the process in a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="283"> Congo: The military attack on the last rebel stronghold </seg>
<seg id="284"> Diehard fans of the 23 million, representing a few hundred fighters, were severed nearly 2000 metres altitude on the farm hills in Runyonyi and Chanzu, Mbuzi, relatives of Bunagana and Jomba, about 80 kilometres north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. </seg>
<seg id="285"> &quot;It hasn&apos;t stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night&quot;, told AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by telephone around 12:30, and according to which a young girl was injured by gunfire in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="286"> &quot;The intensity of clashes has dropped a bit,&quot; he added, &quot;It seems that the FARDC Armed forces repelled a rebel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="287"> According to this witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had &quot;spent the night&quot; in Jomba before climbing to the front for a &quot;sweep operation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="288"> It was very much behind him crackling fed small arms. </seg>
<seg id="289"> In Bunagana, political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebels fell on Wednesday, an AFP reporter could hear heavy weapons detonations. </seg>
<seg id="290"> According to a source at the UN mission for the stabilization of the DRC, the fighting came &quot;in a final phase,&quot; the FARDC &quot;surrounded the remaining 23 positions to dislodge them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="291"> Since the resumption, on Friday, clashes between the Movement of March 23 (23) and the military, the MONUSCO is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides a crucial support to government troops in intelligence, planning and observation. </seg>
<seg id="292"> At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, rode at the front line. </seg>
<seg id="293"> They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana border post with Uganda, the military helped AGO13 civilians a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck of FARDC, to ensure the succession of another spacecraft pounding 23 positions on the hills. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, on Wednesday evening, called again on the rebels to &quot;demobilize voluntarily or be disarmed by force,&quot; but left open the process from Kampala, Kinshasa and the M23 discuss since December without results for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="296"> On the spot, the political leaders of the M 23 hoping to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;We ended the talks, it only remains for the mediation of Uganda to organize the signature,&quot; said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of 23 million, but that information could be immediately confirmed by the government side. </seg>
<seg id="298"> The M23 is born of a mutiny in April 2012, former rebels, mostly Tutsi, integrated into the Army in 2009 after a peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id="299"> The UN and Kinshasa regularly accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny. </seg>
<seg id="300"> The North is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and a basement full of mineral resources. </seg>
<seg id="301"> At Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where they had taken refuge about 5000 people between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that had begun in the morning, reversed at midday. </seg>
<seg id="302"> &quot;This morning we crossed to go in our fields, but the soldiers told us to retreat,&quot; said Imelda nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including an infant on her back. </seg>
<seg id="303"> One has the impression that the shooting is closer to the people. </seg>
<seg id="304"> At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossing the border, some with a mattress on his head, to spend the night in Uganda. </seg>
<seg id="305"> The Israeli army killed a member of Hamas to gaza-sces </seg>
<seg id="306"> Israeli tank fire killed on Thursday a Palestinian militant Islamist Hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, it was reported, according to sources of health services. </seg>
<seg id="307"> A source close to Hamas said fighting erupted in this region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire. </seg>
<seg id="308"> The Israeli army is merely a &quot;targeted action&quot; in the area near a tunnel described as &quot;terrorist&quot; by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid October. </seg>
<seg id="309"> The concern for security in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful figures </seg>
<seg id="310"> At the foot of the statue of founding president, Samora Machel of Mozambique, to laugh at them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chanting peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration. </seg>
<seg id="311"> &quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, general manager of an investment company. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Concern for the future of her country, she shared her work clothes against a T-shirt bearing the words &quot;We want security&quot; in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="313"> For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="314"> The rebel movement Renamo was once a famous, initially supported by Rhodesia governed by white and then the apartheid government of South Africa in the framework of efforts to destabilize the country&apos;s independent Government. </seg>
<seg id="315"> After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it has become an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken the foreign investors and the local population. </seg>
<seg id="317"> The stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the Northwest could attract more than 50 billion investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Italy&apos;s ENI and Anadarko of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other tensions. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Renamo says that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack against its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on 17 October. </seg>
<seg id="320"> The assault on the former rebels then erupted when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for Renamo, according to the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The government makes the Renamo leader to have triggered the conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="322"> President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday the AFP, the French news agency, that Mr Dhlakama is regarded as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;all forces that he was still trying to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="324"> Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="325"> But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the peace agreement of 1992. </seg>
<seg id="326"> He told the FT that he meant that the accord was not respected by Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="327"> &quot;We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year. </seg>
<seg id="329"> &quot;These are two great men (Guebuza and Frelimo) who do not stop to argue,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="330"> None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that it will boycott the municipal elections to be held in November. </seg>
<seg id="332"> The presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt to move a patient to obtain concessions and a war chest from the government. </seg>
<seg id="334"> The share of votes collected by RENAMO steady decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, should get a larger number of votes in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Mr. Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year-wanted to destroy democracy in the country. </seg>
<seg id="336"> &quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, it does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mr. Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="337"> It is not clear what is the ability of the Renamo, but she led disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred miles north of Maputo, Beira, but where is the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, exporting coal. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the rail line. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would reiterate this threat. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mr Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The instability has strengthened the frustrations with the government, said Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings. </seg>
<seg id="343"> &quot;People think that the future of the country are the government and the president, and that is to find solutions to problems,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Omar sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability. </seg>
<seg id="345"> &quot;Nobody cares about the Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want peace, they want to have a free access to the roads,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Pia: at least four injured in a violent dispute </seg>
<seg id="347"> The small town of PIA has experienced an unusual excesses of fever on Thursday evening. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Three police cars, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the testimony gathered... </seg>
<seg id="349"> In this day of Halloween, the evening was troubled by Pia, where a fight involving several people broke out of the side of the post. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Four minor injuries at least would be regrettable. </seg>

<seg id="359"> He is scheduled to appear in Provincial Court in Halifax, in December. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Coulson has used the telephone hacking to verify a pipe </seg>
<seg id="361"> The former editor of News of the World, Andy Coulson had used &quot;the phone hacking, surveillance and the confrontation&quot; trying to confirm a phony pipe on a route involving the interior minister, Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her &quot;pretty special adviser.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="363"> It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective to hack the voicemail of Pawlby and &quot;planted permanently in front of her door&quot;, but Coulson also called and left voice messages. </seg>
<seg id="364"> &quot;The prosecution suggest that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house people hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love the story to people to see what they have to say,&quot; Mr. Edis said. </seg>
<seg id="365"> He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate topics: the phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="366"> The editor is personally involved in the third. </seg>
<seg id="367"> It is clear that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="368"> But what about the first? </seg>
<seg id="369"> He is aware of the phone hacking? </seg>
<seg id="370"> He claims the opposite, but we say &quot;of course.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="371"> The rumors about an affair involving Clarke were taken first by the editorial office of NOTW when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to miss Pawlby, said he had been told: &quot;Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="372"> A band, which recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The investigators also found on the computer seized from the private detective that Miss Pawlby and his sister in a record &quot;projects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="374"> During the period when the detective has investigated it, grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls when asked for information about her, &quot;said Edis. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of movements of Miss Pawlby.. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In a voicemail message he left him on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: &quot;I have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> Mr Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former interior minister David Blunkett. </seg>
<seg id="378"> The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett on a liaison with a married woman while he was attending the Co-d√©fenderesse Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out of the phone hacking. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Bailout plan of $325 million for Tasmania&apos;s health system </seg>
<seg id="382"> The federal government maintains that the bailout plan of $325 million for the ailing health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State funds are not wasted. </seg>
<seg id="383"> Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to end a crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island state, the high rates of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The financing, expected over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="385"> &quot;The government has proposed an emergency bailout plan that we believe will solve the unique challenges the state faces,&quot; Ms Plibersek said today. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The $325 million includes a $31 million campaign for elective surgery. </seg>
<seg id="387"> 2,600 additional operations, especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to reduce the backlog. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Funds are also earmarked for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care, the training of medical, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;These investments will respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the health system of Tasmania,&quot; Ms Plibersek said. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The Minister said the Tasmanian Government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability. </seg>
<seg id="391"> The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where we spend the extra funds. </seg>
<seg id="392"> A commission composed of three people will be established to ensure that the state provides the most effective and efficient way possible. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much, &quot;unless they are followed by a real reform to strengthen the public health system of Tasmania.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> However, he commended the Government for having responded to the request for emergency help to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May. </seg>
<seg id="395"> &quot;I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute significantly to the public health system of Tasmania from the black list,&quot; said Mr Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="396"> According to the State Government, these additional emergency procedures to reverse much of the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But the spokesman for the Opposition Health Peter Dutton believes that today&apos;s announcement is a &quot;a makeshift solution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;The reason why we are here is that the Labour government of the state withdrew $430 million of its health care system,&quot; he said on ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We cannot have a state government that snatches nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth, which is $300 million, and claim that it is a good day. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Mr. Dutton visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that each dollar of bailout plan will not be spent on additional bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="401"> He walks in the mud, the jungle and crosses rivers for free medical care </seg>
<seg id="402"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="403"> Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all of their weekends to see hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="404"> There are not many doctors in this West African nation, barely 1 in 5,000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Vote here or via your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of 10 CNN Hero of the Year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="407"> You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 Heroes, to elect &quot;CNN Hero of the Year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="408"> This person will receive $250,000 for his extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="409"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="411"> At the beginning, he had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that had spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would bear the consequences for the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="412"> &quot;There was no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.. </seg>
<seg id="413"> We would have taken abroad if we had enough money. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in Crowded hospitals and clinics, for any treatment he could benefit. </seg>
<seg id="415"> &quot;It is not easy,&quot; adds Mr. Bwelle.. </seg>
<seg id="416"> You can leave the house at 5 a.m., you rush to the hospital for the first, and you&apos;re not the first. </seg>
<seg id="417"> There are many patients. </seg>
<seg id="418"> People can die because they wait too long. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The situation has not changed much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="420"> In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="421"> By comparison, the U.S. ratio is one doctor for 413 people. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country&apos;s health expenditure in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="424"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; explained Dr. Bwelle.. </seg>
<seg id="425"> And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="426"> After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and her team of volunteers had performed more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year. </seg>
<seg id="428"> He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ascovime, who travels to rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Almost every Friday, with some 30 people, they huddle in vans after the medical equipment on the roof and going through difficult terrain to the villages that need the most help. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The luck does not always follow them. </seg>
<seg id="433"> They have repeatedly had to push vehicles through rivers or muddy tracks. </seg>
<seg id="434"> But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: The community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available housing. </seg>
<seg id="435"> In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle-with his big smile and boundless energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="437"> &quot;We get 500 people at each visit,&quot; Mr. Bwelle said. </seg>
<seg id="438"> They can live to 60 km from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="439"> In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and pests. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Others may receive crutches, collected a pair of glasses or a birth certificate free-document needed to attend school, but many poor families simply can&apos;t afford to buy it. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In the evening, the team practice of simple surgery under local anaesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating theatre and the sterilization of equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="445"> It&apos;s a grueling pace, but the Musicians Village to help the team to stay motivated. </seg>
<seg id="446"> &quot;They beat on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,&quot; explained Mr Bwelle.. </seg>
<seg id="447"> On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done. </seg>
<seg id="448"> The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference to those who are helped. </seg>
<seg id="449"> A man explained that the free operation he underwent to treat a hernia would allow him to work again. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;It will change my future and that of my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="451"> In addition to this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaound√©. </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is the second job, he explains, which funds 60% its association; the rest is covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="453"> &quot;I don&apos;t know when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O&apos;malley, a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer group of Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="454"> He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to conduct these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="455"> For medical students and nursing students like Katie O&apos;malley, who came from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in its missions, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they were not at home. </seg>
<seg id="456"> &quot;One was able to participate in operations to help stanch the blood or get Dr. Bwelle instruments,&quot; explained Ms. o&apos;malley. </seg>
<seg id="457"> It is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you&apos;re a medical student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Student volunteers typically pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected. </seg>
<seg id="459"> But once in Yaound√©, their pensions, their transport and education are being cared for by Dr. Bwelle.. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;He is a hero, there is no doubt,&quot; said Katie o&apos;malley. </seg>
<seg id="461"> He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not about to be extinguished. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For Dr. Bwelle, the workload of relatively constant is not a problem. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Helping others to live happily with the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy. </seg>
<seg id="464"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy when I do this work,&quot; added Mr Bwelle.. </seg>
<seg id="465"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="466"> I hope he sees what I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that lead me to do that. </seg>

<seg id="470"> The interior features bucket seats and harness belts to 6 points, and an intercom system. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Among the options include improved brakes, a service providing access to mechanics bowler works, logistic support and the storage of the vehicle between two events. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Drew bowler, the bowler motorsport director general said: &quot;The fans who join rallies bowler have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="473"> They are not all experienced, some looking for excitement and adventure and a realistic access to international events. </seg>
<seg id="474"> We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallyes raids. </seg>
<seg id="475"> We had a lot of fun to develop the vehicle of the Defender challenge - the championship is really going to be exciting. </seg>

<seg id="477"> Both France&apos;s Pierre Nora </seg>
<seg id="478"> Perplexed, academics have long struggled to identify and locate Pierre Nora. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Professor in the lecture halls and classrooms? </seg>
<seg id="480"> Without a doubt, but by emphasizing its low for the Traverse, Sciences-po, Hautes Etudes. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Arbitrator of the works of others in her office on the street gaston-gallimard? </seg>
<seg id="482"> In fact, but ignoring the work hidden underground and writing from the publisher. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Heir to the armchair Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy? </seg>
<seg id="484"> Certainly, but knowing that such a rite cannot replace the real holy oil, the thesis, that it happened. </seg>
<seg id="485"> They readily acknowledged him as a major champion, host and for their work, but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce it himself. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Has this image uncertain the monument &quot;sites of memory,&quot; to which he attached his name, also contributed. </seg>
<seg id="487"> The nasty languages were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator with a keen glance and weighted with scholarship, but hopelessly dilettante. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The two books published by Nora here almost two years ago have already established that anyone who was not writing were many and well written. </seg>
<seg id="489"> The book here should make him permanently. </seg>
<seg id="490"> There are, however, once more, the temptation of ubiquity, casual/promiscuous intellectual, the jubilation last jump as feet from one subject to another. </seg>
<seg id="491"> But it soon becomes apparent that the disparate objects collected in this book so as to reduce the junk at one and the same passion: Discover the constitutive node of the French identity. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Why these dramatic appeals to national unity? </seg>
<seg id="493"> Identity: It is a concern. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Recently, we have collectively been invited to give a definition. </seg>
<seg id="495"> But in the minds of our leaders, the French identity was a timeless essence. </seg>
<seg id="496"> It was only in the accidents, and the matter requires Jacobinism, was entrusted to the Prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters. </seg>
<seg id="497"> That stalking Pierre Nora is quite another. </seg>
<seg id="498"> It is not an heir to an eternal Francit√©, he refuses to the definition. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Analyst worried a familiar strangeness, wandering in a forest of symbols, at each step by an object in the shape of Rory R√©bus, irritating questions. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Including this one, which comes from the company itself: why, in a country so permanently installed at its borders, if formerly big-boned and bridge-of-castle firmly, what these dramatic calls to unit? </seg>
<seg id="501"> They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to avert the disorder born discord of French history. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Frank and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundian, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here are very old. </seg>
<seg id="503"> And the most famous, of course, is the one that splits into two national history. </seg>
<seg id="504"> After the earthquake, the French Revolution two stories and they have two nations, one Catholic, the other revolutionary. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The second was the death of the first, but without reaching the deny; on the contrary, in the sacredness and all the more eager of unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head of anyone who was the obvious and powerful incarnation. </seg>
<seg id="506"> And, from there, a nation solidly binary, split between left and right, secular and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="507"> To feel this singularity of French identity, nothing beats the four not out of L&apos;hexagone, so the American getaway of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Because America and France have one and the other is a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to start a new company. </seg>
<seg id="509"> But the American parentage is only better highlight what is unique to us. </seg>
<seg id="510"> There, men who had left their former regime in England and had more to worry about. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Here, men crowded an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more dramatic. </seg>
<seg id="512"> A consensual revolution when here it has sown the drama and conflict. </seg>
<seg id="513"> The founding fathers always honoured, and here the revolutionary ancestors who were struggling to make models, and the rest fought. </seg>
<seg id="514"> An institutional constancy, and by a cascade of constitutions, as mistakes catch up and trials to resume. </seg>
<seg id="515"> France, which is at stake, France which has just </seg>
<seg id="516"> But there was a time when the French thought able to reattach the torn dress in their history and overcome the curse of both. </seg>
<seg id="517"> The Third Republic, Central Time and creator, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who are employed to repair the revolutionary divide, by teaching schoolchildren all that in old France preparing obscurely modern France and offering them a unified version of their story. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But this peaceful identity had only one time. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Here she is again in the debate, pushed by a new immigration, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European space. </seg>
<seg id="520"> The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France is at stake and the careful outline of France. </seg>
<seg id="521"> With the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It discovered that it was a homelover chemineau. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The man many curiosities, slightly obsessive revolved around a single idea. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The Prowler edges stood at the center of the center. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And that, more than half a century, a story about the idea of a nation, but had evaded the Initiatic exercise of the thesis, gives us, cum grano salis, that it will eventually make it. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Certainly in a form less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle. </seg>
<seg id="527"> But make no mistake, just as binding. </seg>
<seg id="528"> Because far more than is required of the university curriculum, this Th√®se-ci told the inner need of a life. </seg>
<seg id="529"> How biometrics will invade our lives </seg>
<seg id="530"> Eventually the passwords to enter to access his smartphone or make purchases? </seg>
<seg id="531"> U.S. researchers, French or Japanese, we predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors, telephones and computers. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, believes that &quot;the biometric century will be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="533"> Only the biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a Universe Transverse and transnational as well as the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but troubled. </seg>
<seg id="535"> Anything that in 2011 and in France, the National Commission on Information Technology and Freedoms allowed 774 fingerprint recognition systems, hand or venous network of hand in business, government, canteens... </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,&quot; is saddened by Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="537"> The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Biometrics will rely on new technologies, which will enable new services to citizens and consumers. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Today, in France, the biometric data are most often used fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous system of the palm or finger. </seg>
<seg id="540"> But each of these techniques has its constraints. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;For example, some people who work on concrete fingers very damaged and their fingerprints are unreadable,&quot; Philippe Robin, technical director of Thales Communications Identity &amp; Security. </seg>
<seg id="542"> And the collection and verification of the venous network and the outline of the hand involves a voluntary gesture and precise. </seg>
<seg id="543"> It is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure must be repeated and sometimes it takes time. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Therefore, research is conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye). </seg>
<seg id="545"> Thanks to the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and computing capability of computers to analyse data, these techniques become operational. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the R&amp;D labs of Accenture in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="547"> With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have made automatic border using facial recognition. </seg>
<seg id="548"> It is now possible to identify a face or iris. </seg>
<seg id="549"> &quot;Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or the manner of walking with the help of sound sensors, but it is a silent environment,&quot; says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Single marker and tamper-free, DNA also raises hopes and concerns. </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;In the current state of knowledge, it can be seen as the ultimate biometric data,&quot; confirms Sophie vulliet-tavernier, director of education, innovation and foresight to the CNIL. </seg>
<seg id="552"> But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="553"> NEC offers the services of the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples from the crime scene and in an hour. </seg>
<seg id="554"> The use of biometrics are divided into two groups: the identification (to recognize a person among others) and e-authentication (to ensure that the person is who he or she purports to be). </seg>
<seg id="555"> The identification was so far the issuance of identity: we must confront the biometrics (fingerprints, iris) with the information the state has on all citizens already on file. </seg>
<seg id="556"> This ensures that a person is not trying to steal someone else&apos;s identity. </seg>
<seg id="557"> This principle of comparison can have other applications. </seg>
<seg id="558"> NEC offers recognition of VIPS at the entrance of a hotel or a store. </seg>
<seg id="559"> &quot;We get the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them with photos of celebrities who move freely over the Internet,&quot; explains Dany Nassif, NEC, France, Business Development for biometric identification solutions. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Another use: Take a photo of a down-and-out who lined up in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the wait times. </seg>
<seg id="561"> E-authentication initially involved physical access (borders, secure facilities, canteens...) or logiques (opening of a computer). </seg>
<seg id="562"> There is added, more recently, the control of presence. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;A biometric staffand avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that points to another,&quot; justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture. </seg>
<seg id="564"> But, increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money to certain distributors by introducing his card and hand over a biometric reader: it replaces the knock of the secret code. </seg>
<seg id="566"> A similar technique is tested in villeneuve- d&apos;ascq and D&apos;angoul√™me by natural security company in partnership with banks and signs of mass distribution: When to pay at the store with her credit card, the customer doesn&apos;t pare its code, but introduces his finger in a reader that scans the veins. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The trial is scheduled to last for six months. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If it is successful, the biometric readers could soon reach the French traders. </seg>
<seg id="569"> To reassure users </seg>
<seg id="570"> There are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public. </seg>
<seg id="571"> The first is to explain that she can save time. </seg>
<seg id="572"> &quot;If, through biometrics, a client remains in UNJSPF thirty seconds of less, it is significant,&quot; explains the director of a large surface. </seg>
<seg id="573"> The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will recognize your voice and you propose options. </seg>
<seg id="574"> And, finally, reassured by the precautions taken to protect databases. </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;The fingerprints are stored on a server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which is trying to block the move,&quot; lists Philippe Robin, Thales. </seg>
<seg id="576"> But, in the absence of comprehensive studies, it is impossible to know whether the speech really convince users. </seg>
<seg id="577"> The specialists of the protection of privacy, they are still worried. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;The progress of the facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me fear the worst: a blanket surveillance&quot;, predicts Andrew Patrick, the Office of Privacy Protection in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on luggage </seg>
<seg id="580"> Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 on passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on baggage and $2 for a cup of coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it reported that the passengers could not open the can carry with them on the descent of the plane. </seg>
<seg id="582"> The new hand luggage bags are stowed in the overhead compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will still be free. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if passengers paid only once at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="584"> The spokesman for Frontier, Kate O&apos;malley said that $100 was provided to encourage passengers to pay the fee in advance. </seg>
<seg id="585"> &quot;We don&apos;t want to pay the price,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="586"> The airlines started charging for first and second checked bags in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were as much as they could in carry-on luggage stowed in overhead bins, and there was often more prominently in these compartments. </seg>
<seg id="588"> These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board. </seg>
<seg id="589"> O&apos;malley said that these new fees will not be used to raise money. </seg>
<seg id="590"> This is to impress upon Frontier&apos;s most loyal customers as it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the overhead bins. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline company will not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For example, a passenger waiting for a gate frontier could carry a bag for free, while the person next in the queue would have to pay $100 for a similar bag. </seg>
<seg id="593"> O&apos; Malley explained that the site and the procedures for the registration of frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before arriving at the door. </seg>
<seg id="594"> The hand luggage of frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other costs, but the airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="596"> They believe that the costs of baggage handling are important and that passengers who want this service should pay. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Many people on Wall Street believe the addition of baggage fees as a sign that proves that the airlines have to pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="598"> But many of them do not have hit the baggage fees. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost carrier Allegiant has followed a little later. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the costs extra. </seg>
<seg id="601"> He estimated in a report in December 2011, the hand luggage of Spirit were $50 million a year. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines, recently travelled on spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when the passengers will discover the unusual hand baggage fees charged by the company. </seg>
<seg id="603"> &quot;I had never seen a boarding procedure as fluid in my entire career,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="604"> I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The plane was full, he added, &quot;the passengers boarded at lightning speed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> Frontier also like Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can carry the cannot open with them, and those who take coffee can be recycled for free. </seg>
<seg id="608"> It will distribute free water. </seg>
<seg id="609"> US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained, and when no other major airline had followed. </seg>
<seg id="610"> The frontier&apos;s decision to charge for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is his latest effort to encourage customers to move on its website. </seg>
<seg id="611"> The airlines are paying to the online travel sellers such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="612"> This prompted airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than go to an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, Frontier has gone further in this area. </seg>
<seg id="614"> In September, it began to offer only half of frequent flyer miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="615"> On Wednesday, it reduced the bonus miles by 25% on a trip. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Thus, a frontier of travel 1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles. </seg>

<seg id="621"> Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Previous studies had found that the dogs happy shuffled their tails more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs the shuffled over to the left. </seg>
<seg id="623"> But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to it. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;Everyone knows that, in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> Here, we tried to see what it was in other species. </seg>
<seg id="626"> He added that as well as humans, dogs on the right side of the brain was in charge of the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="627"> For more information on how the dogs react to the movement of a disorderly queue of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies containing other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="628"> They measured heart rate and analysed their behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="629"> We must certainly not long before we understand why their tails sometimes goes on the one hand, and sometimes from the other. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;We presented to dogs films containing other dogs - a naturalistic version is a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors - and we were able to fix the movement of the tail, and present it as going to the left or to the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> When the animals were given a dog without a tail is wagging the expression to the right (from the point of view of the dog that wags her tail), they remained perfectly relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="632"> But when they spotted a tail mainly deflected to the left (again from the point of view of the dog that wags her tail), their heart rate has accelerated, and they looked anxious. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate them thanks to these movements. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Instead, he believes the dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry. </seg>
<seg id="635"> He added: &quot;If you meet several times with other dogs, and if you notice, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you&apos;re depending on this experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="636"> The researchers suggest that the results could lead to owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of both the left and the right in the canine species. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that the dogs turned his head to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog and right when he was a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="639"> And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;The dogs were more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is contained in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="640"> He said that the differences could be that the dogs involved in the various studies did not consider fully the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="641"> A study on how the dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="642"> &quot;While many elements, among different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="643"> However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered, it will surely not long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on the one hand and sometimes on the other. </seg>

<seg id="668"> This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to take a hand in the matter of the NSA&apos;s eavesdropping after the revelations made by the former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="669"> It is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Asked about the matter, an official of the American administration replied: &quot;The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance to the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="671"> Speaking anonymously, the official did not specify if such monitoring was in place in the past. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Another official, He said that Barack Obama had instructed to cease these practices during the past weeks. </seg>
<seg id="673"> This instruction was given at about the same time as putting an end to eavesdropping on the UN headquarters in New York. </seg>
<seg id="674"> In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved on Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but allowed their prosecution. </seg>

<seg id="702"> The Congolese army is chasing the rebels of M 23 </seg>
<seg id="703"> The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were chasing the rebels of M 23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda. </seg>
<seg id="704"> The 23 appears to be beaten after being chased from villages in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency. </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;We will continue the M 23 and drive it wherever it is hiding because they are criminals,&quot; said Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman of the FARDC. </seg>
<seg id="706"> We must not allow them to reorganize themselves because they ball the Congolese people for too long. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The time has come to bring peace. </seg>
<seg id="708"> Officials of the M 23 explained to have evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks commits to its claims to the peace talks. </seg>
<seg id="709"> The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to be dropped this week, and in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="711"> At their peak in November, the insurgents have occupied Goma, capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO peacekeepers. </seg>
<seg id="712"> The fall of Goma has led the UN mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staffing, to strengthen its mandate and to create a rapid intervention brigade made up of South African, Tanzanian and Malawian soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="713"> For its part, the staff of the FARDC has been redesigned and the military has gone on the offensive against the M23, change the course of the war. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The pace of government troops today is unprecedented. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The 23 million seems to be coming to an end,&quot; predicts one expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, a Congo Siasa blog. </seg>
<seg id="716"> It would be history-it would be the first time that the Kinshasa Government manages to beat a major insurgency. </seg>
<seg id="717"> And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC. </seg>
<seg id="718"> UN experts accuse Rwanda, who vehemently denies supporting militarily the M 23, initially set up by former Congolese military mutineers. </seg>
<seg id="719"> The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, said a Foreign Office spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="720"> Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military reprisals in the wake of the shells fell in Rwandan territory. </seg>

<seg id="724"> John Kerry conceded, is unprecedented, that an American espionage &quot;had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="725"> John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States about its surveillance programs in unprecedented admission that on several occasions, the spying &quot;had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="726"> The secretary of state also admitted that he had, as Barack Obama, ruled on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden on the NSA&apos;s spying activities. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;It is undeniable that the president, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things on automatic pilot because we had the opportunity, since the Second World War and to the difficult years of the cold war, then of course the September 11.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="729"> He then became the first high-ranking member of the Government of the United States to admit that the American spy had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone&apos;s rights had not been violated. </seg>
<seg id="730"> He said: &quot;In some cases, it has gone too far.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="731"> And the president is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he was now a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels wrong. </seg>
<seg id="732"> I assure you that innocent people will not be abused, in the framework of this process. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="734"> He added: &quot;We live in a new world where people are ready to blow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="735"> There is a radical extremism around the world, which is determined to try to kill people, causing them to explode and addressed by Governments. </seg>
<seg id="736"> And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act? </seg>
<seg id="737"> We have prevented aircraft from falling, blowing up buildings and people being killed, because we have been aware of the facts in advance. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight against terrorism with the United States, said on Thursday the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made on a possible withdrawal of anti-terror organizations because of frustration about the oversight of the National Security Agency. </seg>
<seg id="740"> &quot;It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that the Europeans are still in our mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and President of the European affairs subcommittee of the U.S. Senate, in an interview from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="741"> And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="742"> The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however, the agency&apos;s director said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that Nato allies had collected and shared with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said that her Office was organizing a tour of the congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The names of other legislators meeting is expected to be unveiled in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="747"> He said that the route remained to be defined. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Murphy said the aim of the trip was to improve relations, but also to show &quot;tough love.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> He explained that the European heads of state were to be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs that they applied themselves for years. </seg>
<seg id="750"> &quot;We can change our surveillance programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not alone in the world of espionage,&quot; Murphy said. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel this weekend to the middle east and Poland to manage the resentment caused by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the U.S. surveillance activities. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Scott Brown&apos;s appeal rejected </seg>
<seg id="753"> Scott Brown, the captain of the Celtic Glasgow, saw his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches for his club, against Ajax and AC Milan. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Expelled against Barca for having sent a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment had his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA. </seg>

<seg id="756"> For the CEO of Titan, &quot; &quot;The proposed purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="757"> After having thrown in the towel with a vengeance in January for a partial resumption of Goodyear amiens-nord, promised the closure, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tyre titan, expresses today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 137 in the plant. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Jean-luc M√©lenchon, minister of productive recovery, had already announced on Monday 21 October. </seg>
<seg id="759"> Having dropped the plan to purchase the plant in January, you will return today. </seg>
<seg id="760"> You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of &quot;so-called workers,&quot; who &quot;work three hours&quot; a day, unions &quot;crazy,&quot; with the CGT. </seg>
<seg id="761"> This U-turn is not understood. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Is it to please Mr Jospin? </seg>
<seg id="763"> I was trying to do something nice for someone. </seg>
<seg id="764"> Except for my wife. </seg>
<seg id="765"> Mr Jospin, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs are among the best paid. </seg>
<seg id="766"> If I hurt anyone by my words, I am sorry. </seg>
<seg id="767"> But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The truth hurts you? </seg>
<seg id="769"> Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours Underdevelops France. </seg>
<seg id="770"> In India, China and other countries, is ten to twelve hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But I don&apos;t have any prejudices about France. </seg>
<seg id="772"> What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, good facilities, is well located and has space to expand. </seg>
<seg id="773"> Why titan he needs so much of this plant? </seg>
<seg id="774"> Titan does not need to buy the plant. </seg>
<seg id="775"> But, with the right price and skilled workers, it is worth a try. </seg>
<seg id="776"> What kind of agreement you expect between the CGT and Goodyear? </seg>
<seg id="777"> If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think that 100% of employees have accepted. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Now, imagine that Titan Buys Goodyear plant closed. </seg>
<seg id="779"> Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country of the European Union, which still has its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="780"> I think that Mr Jospin knows that. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, it wants to keep the plant in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs. </seg>
<seg id="782"> Titan accepts to recruit among the approximately 1,200 employees of Goodyear. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Mr. Jospin also he needs a commitment of titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Therefore, there will be more employees at the plant. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Mr Jospin said that you were ready to ensure these 333 jobs over four years. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Can you confirm it? </seg>
<seg id="788"> The only number that I mentioned to the minister is 333. </seg>
<seg id="789"> I know he would want a guarantee of four years. </seg>
<seg id="790"> But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance payments. </seg>
<seg id="791"> If all employees accept them, the plan to purchase the plant starts with zero employee. </seg>
<seg id="792"> How can we give guarantees of employment when there are no more employees on the site? </seg>
<seg id="793"> If Mr Jospin comes the CGT and Goodyear to agree and that Titan is buying the plant, we intend to remain amiens-nord over four years. </seg>

<seg id="827"> Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday it had received no objections from the U.S. authorities for their merger, is closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency. </seg>
<seg id="828"> The merger brings the second global agency, Omnicom and Publicis. </seg>
<seg id="829"> &quot;Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiration of the previously announced merger of Publicis and Omnicom Group, under the hart-scott-rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,&quot; the two groups announced in a news release. </seg>
<seg id="830"> They also received the necessary approvals in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea. </seg>

<seg id="833"> New class-action against the brothers St. Croix </seg>
<seg id="834"> A new request for class-action suit was filed against the brothers St. Croix, on sexual assault, which allegedly took place, this time at Saint Joseph&apos;s Oratory, as well as several orphanages, schools and colleges. </seg>
<seg id="835"> The request is based on the testimony of the Complainant, identified as &quot;J&quot;, who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first notre-dame-des-neiges by his teacher brother, then by his confessor Father Bernard, St. Joseph&apos;s Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The first appeal was only three, and when we announced the settlement, many people told us: &quot;I was, can I register?,&quot; said lawyer Alain Arsenault, who represents the victims in the two appeals. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The class action, which has been tabled is notable for the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of St. Croix. </seg>
<seg id="838"> At present, the appeal brings complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers Croix. </seg>
<seg id="839"> The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the targeted schools closed their doors in the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The appeal also stressed that the congregation of St. Croix and St. Joseph&apos;s Oratory, which is a separate entity, &quot;allowed sexual abuse are perpetrated against children,&quot; that they &quot;have a moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims,&quot; they &quot;were aware of sexual abuse and the hushed, however,&quot; and that they &quot;knowingly and deliberately chose to ignore the problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="841"> These latest accusations are based on letters written by the brothers&apos; lawyer, Me √âmile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research in the archives on the subject by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former St. Croix&apos;s brother who publicly denounced the abuse. </seg>
<seg id="842"> The class action must first pass the admissibility in Superior Court. </seg>
<seg id="843"> Once the admissibility accepted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits. </seg>

<seg id="847"> The Congolese army was preparing on Friday to a fresh assault against the rebel strongholds of 23 near Bunagana, in eastern DRC. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The aim is to dislodge the M 23 of the hills overlooking Bunagana. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Yesterday we took the bugina hill, which overlooks the Mbuzi. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Today, Mbuzi should fall. </seg>
<seg id="851"> There will be more than the Runyonyi Hill. </seg>
<seg id="852"> &quot;That is not very strategic Chanzu,&quot; told the AP the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Mr. Paluku plans to visit on Saturday in Bunagana. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 kilometres north of Goma. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It was echoed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Since then, several hundred Irr√©ductibles M 23, are cut off to nearly 2,000 meters of altitude on the farm hills in Runyonyi and Chanzu, Mbuzi, relatives of Bunagana and Jomba nearby </seg>
<seg id="857"> In Jomba, a resident who had reported nearby fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was &quot;calm since this morning.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="858"> According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting and were buried. </seg>
<seg id="859"> A girl was shot and wounded, and three other people were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, added the witness quoted by AFP. </seg>

<seg id="861"> The court blocked a decision on the policy of control and search of the NYPD </seg>
<seg id="862"> A federal appeals court blocked on Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the programme of control and search of the New York Police Department and functus record. </seg>
<seg id="863"> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal by the city. </seg>
<seg id="864"> The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens. </seg>
<seg id="865"> The city draws its conclusions and its remedial orders, including a decision to award a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments on the request for suspension. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The appeals court said the judge should be relieved of the case because it has breached the code of conduct for judges by undermining the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to criticism of the court. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men under their control and search program. </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has appointed an outside monitor to oversee the changes, including the reform of policies, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the neighbourhoods where the greatest number of controls. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In August, New York City has agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police control. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after the March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The tactical control and the search has been criticized by many civil rights advocates. </seg>
<seg id="873"> This system of control and search there for decades in some form, but the number of inspections has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that were primarily black and Hispanic men. </seg>
<seg id="874"> A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and transformed into collective action. </seg>
<seg id="875"> The supporters calling for changes in the program control and search of the NYPD say they will end the unfair practices, will be more effective police forces and we trust, and will change how police departments use the policy. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Opponents say such changes would undermine the morale of the police without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the larger problem of police forces under pressure after the police numbers were greatly reduced in the last decade. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The judge stressed that it did not put an end to the practice of stop and search, which are constitutional, but reformed how the NYPD was implementing its controls. </seg>
<seg id="878"> The NSA revelations increase the paranoia of companies to oversight of state </seg>
<seg id="879"> On a spring day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&apos;s financial capital. </seg>
<seg id="880"> At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The German media explained that the halfdozen hoped to identify the presence of antennas to listen and that the transaction has sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="882"> James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, insisted again in September that the United States does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="883"> But since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, has begun to reveal her treasure trove of information on the secrets of the supervision of the United States, European governments and business leaders no longer know if the director to speak. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by American service providers of storage in the cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have attracted more than ever the paranoia of companies to state oversight. </seg>
<seg id="885"> The revelation that the phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, maybe even for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. </seg>
<seg id="886"> If the most powerful person in Europe can be covered, while business leaders are also potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Snowden has made transparent intensive collaboration between US intelligence agencies and companies. </seg>
<seg id="888"> I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest. </seg>
<seg id="889"> &quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; said Oliver Gr√ºn, president of bitmi, which represents the German SMES in the IT sector. </seg>
<seg id="890"> German companies believe that the United States will be as important a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and theft of data, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY. </seg>
<seg id="891"> However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication so far that the United States had sent trade secrets of foreign companies to U.S. companies. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Politicians have expressed concern at the idea that the EU does not have adequate computer and Internet skills and think that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="893"> Business leaders are skeptical about it. </seg>
<seg id="894"> A member of the German Parliament said that we should create a Google. </seg>
<seg id="895"> I cannot turn a blind eye and reopen them slowly... </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;It is not the right way to do it,&quot; says Hasso Plattner, president of the German business software company, SAP. </seg>
<seg id="897"> If we wanted a strong IT industry in Europe, then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Everything is subsidized in Germany, coal cars, passing by the farmers. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Everything but the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Still, the scale and sophistication of American spy agencies exposed by Snowden&apos;s revelations were a shock for some companies that previously believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of oversight. </seg>
<seg id="901"> A big change is happening in cloud computing since European leaders acknowledged that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="902"> According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, approximately 10% of Americans have given up their plans to use an American supplier of storage in the cloud services after the revelations about the American data mining program PRISM. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: &quot;Our clients ask us a question today than we were a year ago: where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this court?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="904"> Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be maintained at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="905"> It is not surprising that there is economic espionage. </seg>
<seg id="906"> There are always had. </seg>
<seg id="907"> &quot;It is a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, director general of the chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="908"> The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level like we are frisking them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it would give the advantage to an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Large companies have long hammer the message that it is unwise to recover a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the executive board of automaker Audi, said that the collection of mobile phones before the meetings of the Council, so that they could not be used as a remote listening devices, is a common practice for years. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The German halfdozen advises its leaders consider using simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad because of the threat to the integrity of the smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Prepaid phones are then discarded. </seg>
<seg id="914"> However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="915"> In Germany, Many SMES are world leaders in their particular niches. </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;SMES often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,&quot; the halfdozen warns in a report. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The U.S. alert their own societies on the economic spying activities carried out by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="918"> The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, France, Russia and Israel, guilty of the second degree to have carried out acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="919"> A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="920"> Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French domestic intelligence agency the DCRI, said in an interview this month: &quot;The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> A tax on foreign property owners to burst the bubble in London </seg>
<seg id="922"> The Treasury has provisionally estimated the extent of the tax on capital gains, but is awaiting a final decision by Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, included a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than ¬£ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold in a company rather than individual. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The stamp duty already applies to residential properties of the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea and is ¬£ 708 million in the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber region. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Mr Cook said: &quot;Following the increase in the stamp duty on properties of high value and the introduction of the antiavoidance law, it is very difficult to argue that the high value properties are Sous-impos√©es regardless of the effects of the housing tax system obsolete.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the current owners reluctant to sell,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="926"> Real Estate - 5 to 10% of the highest price of the real estate market - in the thriving sector, located in southwest London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8% during the last year. </seg>
<seg id="927"> The prices in the central London show a steady increase from year to year by 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an &quot;internal market&quot; in the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills Research. </seg>

<seg id="930"> The Big Three Detroit automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The analysts expected an average of 15.4 million in annualized sales and adjusted for seasonal variations, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates from Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst. </seg>
<seg id="932"> In a note to clients, he believes that this slight setback can be explained by &quot;the&quot; shutdown &quot;government and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="933"> GM, however, reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 P402 vehicles, against 211 563 expected by the consensus. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The four brands of the group saw their trade performance is improving compared to October 2012. </seg>

<seg id="948"> The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that the high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England, will start at the beginning of the phase 1 in 2026. </seg>
<seg id="949"> The transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project &quot;would bring the UK.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="950"> The Scottish transport minister, Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; by the idea of working with the British government on the project. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Upon completion of Phase 2, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> In June, the government revised upward the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from 32.7 MD ¬£ 42.6 multi-billion pound. </seg>
<seg id="954"> The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2L Ltd on improving rail capacity and improved journey times for the north of England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="955"> This must include the possibility of journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh to three hours. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our aim for HS2L focuses on a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="957"> We push the HS2L project because the benefits are enormous. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Without him, we are facing a problem of capacity of our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="959"> But it is also to develop connectivity among the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that they are better thanks to HS2. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="961"> For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support &quot;unequivocally&quot; the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Mr Brown said: &quot;High-speed rail has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also makes the economic weight of Scotland in the global project of a high-speed rail network in Britain. </seg>
<seg id="963"> &quot;We are excited by the idea of working in partnership with the British government to review options to bring high speed rail to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the online accessibility that the Scottish Government is already planning. </seg>
<seg id="964"> &quot;I am eager to read the report with British ministers next year and we will decide together on the next steps.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="965"> UN hails the new objectives in the fight against poverty </seg>
<seg id="966"> The UN will get to work on a new series of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Australian diplomats have played a key role in the establishment of &quot;Sustainable Development&quot; to replace the MDGS, which expire in 2015, before the UN summit on sustainable development which began the day in Rio de Janeiro. </seg>
<seg id="968"> They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit. </seg>
<seg id="969"> UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to &quot;rise above national interests.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="970"> &quot;I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set goals of universal sustainable development (ODD),&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="971"> These odd will build on the progress achieved in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework. </seg>

<seg id="973"> Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="974"> Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for infants born with ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The male or female of new born no longer awarded, so rigid, at birth. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to disclose the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on his birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a sex-change surgery for their babies, and to combat discrimination against intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="978"> According to the BBC, a person intersexed have said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="979"> I will remain the patchwork that created the doctors, bruised and Scarface. </seg>
<seg id="980"> It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year, nor is it a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="981"> They are LGBTI, inter-sex forming part of the Group of the sixty diseases diagnosed disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosome or gonads (ovaries or testes) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information for the award, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical procedure, if any. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and expert on sexual identification, said that the new German law &quot;seems to be a good idea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="985"> The intersex children posed an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="986"> &quot;Some people are suffering from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical procedure, but it is not the case for most children,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is possible to make a sexual assignment without the operation, and see how the identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="988"> Science, which is how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise. </seg>
<seg id="989"> Nobody can answer the question of why this happens. </seg>
<seg id="990"> It&apos;s like the mystery that surrounds the homosexual people. </seg>
<seg id="991"> A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but rather to their constitution, which is not only that of a man or a woman exclusively, but in general the two at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other. </seg>
<seg id="992"> These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), the primary sexual traits (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="993"> The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by transgender and intersex people in employment, and the extent of the acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Young boys gender non-conforming now camps specially for them. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; on their official documents. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie may-welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as &quot;neutral&quot; after winning his appeal, which allows him to keep an &quot;unspecified&quot; for life. </seg>
<seg id="997"> The German passports will contain a third appointment next to M or F-x for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="998"> In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="999"> In 2011, dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country have signed a petition for the &quot;gender theory&quot; be removed from school books. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> The American site Catholic Online also objected to German law, writing that &quot;since the world is dragged into a new situation, where the genre is a choice, but where sexual activity is not reversed, the other two pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1001"> In Maryland, the mother of an infant on baby zone has also said that it would prefer that one sex is given to babies at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> &quot;Parenting is stressful enough without the additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said on the website for young parents. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> Historically, children born without male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, named after the Greek god who had a double. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> And there is barely a decade, the medical community believed the genre as a slate, we can erase and redraw it. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> But now, many of those who question the ethical basis of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel its sexual reassignment when he grows up. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> &quot;In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,&quot; Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, one caller to the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money, of the Johns Hopkins University, who believes that the genre is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the social and environmental signals-how parents raising a child-interact with genes and hormones of a child for the shape in order to be identified as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> But in a case of 1966, known as &quot;John Joan,&quot; his theories have given rise to controversy. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> He advised parents to a small boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to castrate entirely, by removing the testicles, and raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> &quot;Money has presented it as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case,&quot; Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> At the age of about 15 years, he has re-emerged as a boy and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But at 38, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Drescher said that some doctors &quot;always repeat this model.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1017"> But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say &quot; [ that ] they are not satisfied with the outcome.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Doctors could not say if he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never have a &quot;satisfactory&quot; life as a man. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> So shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce has undergone surgical removal of the external body and testicles and was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> He was taking female hormones at the age of 12. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> &quot;I knew that I was not a girl,&quot; he told abcnews.com. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> At 18, he underwent a vaginoplastie.. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> But depressed and realizing that something wasn&apos;t right, he asked his medical record. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> What he found was horrified. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> I was sterilized at birth - and no one had ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for her sexual organs can develop. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> After learning the truth, he became a man with a testosterone treatment and had her breasts removed. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The surgery made him sterile. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which seeks to standardize the collection of intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> But Anne tamar-mattis, executive director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigma.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> &quot;Many activists are worried that the German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child an&quot; indeterminate &quot;sex,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> We are afraid that it encourages the interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> We believe that it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Tamar-mattis said his organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1038"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The German law regarding the attribution of sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> This is not a battle that young children should undertake at that age. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and to help thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law &quot;empower&quot; parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> Dr. Baratz&apos;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a capacity/dds called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> She has a vagina, but no womb or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Now aged 29, Katie is married and in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;The law allows some latitude for parents so they do not have to make hasty decisions,&quot; Baratz said. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Thus, all goes well - you can raise your child and the like. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> You don&apos;t have to rush for a surgical procedure that is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> &quot;It puts the child at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Finally, the child will decide what gender he or she feels the most comfortable - and it is something fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> This allows the child to make the decision for himself. </seg>

<seg id="1062"> I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change </seg>
<seg id="1063"> He said that Obama has made commendable efforts were thwarted by the Republican Party&apos;s obstructionism </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare, nor the drone attacks </seg>
<seg id="1065"> The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what might have been </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the 2nd year of medicine at Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I&apos;m reading a terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It is called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> When I finished the medical records of patients in the evening and go to sleep, this book Remm√®ne me when the policies inspired millions of people and where the speech could leave you breathless. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> The election ended in a landslide victory and the presenters of The News newspapers took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> My comrades wept with joy and my parents have retained all the newspapers they found. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> A young visionary team moves into the White House and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> During the transition period of Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82% of favourable opinions. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> And then I shut the book. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Returning to the present is a difficult, it&apos;s like waking from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> It is hard to remember these days full of optimism, such as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It had nothing to do with what I had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> I put the credit of Obama&apos;s major achievements since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of the &quot;neither seen nor experienced&quot; and the assassination of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> In addition, I think the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> But after repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and my colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> I am on the verge of despair. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> The Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, nor the child attacks innocent foreigners by drones. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans&apos; privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> It cannot justify the killing of anwar al-awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the escape of public finance and exceeding authorized expenditures during presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that said that the White House&apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1088"> And, more recently, it does not excuse the failure to develop a single website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> I do not know if this is what I expected. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that leadership could contradict the previous political campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance, like the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> However, all of the examples that I listed above seem to largely be the choice of the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> That is what bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> I have voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Mitt Romney had a confused alternative and refined that seemed not to determine its policies or its positions. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Yet, while the index of favourable opinions plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> It makes me wish the numerous promises that have soared. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> At a meeting of advertisements, he told his team that they can get back on track and remain true to their cause. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> &quot;I want us to focus on our talent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> We have to remember who we are. </seg>

<seg id="1118"> RBS suspended two traders on the exchange market </seg>
<seg id="1119"> Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders on its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global regulators over suspicions of market manipulation of currency starts to bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Some of the world&apos;s biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigation of the largest financial market in the world, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands each day. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation, which echoes the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> &quot;The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators,&quot; said a representative of the bank two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had sent files of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and had been suspended from his position as European head of spot currency trading at jpmorgan. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Rohan Ramchandani, head of foreign exchange spot trading at Citi, was placed on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> None of these traders have no charges. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Mr. Usher&apos;s record included instant messages sent to and from bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the case said. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> UBS said this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Worldwide, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority-examine the allegations made on bankers who allegedly conspired to manipulate exchange rates. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> HSBC, Citigroup, jpmorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said sources close to the case. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Banks picked instant messages and emails for years to find cases of wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The news about these investigations shook traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of the trading units from investment banks in recent years, but that was challenged this year due to the weak currency volatility which limits the opportunities for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Some bankers have tried to play down the issue by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the currency market highly liquid, but the traders seniors explained that this is not necessarily true. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms &quot;explains that it is possible to start to have an impact on the market at a low cost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1136"> The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in his office of the London stock exchange traded funds this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> &quot;We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was under control,&quot; said a representative of Credit Suisse. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> A Chinese newspaper, which launched an appeal &quot;will be redrafted&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1140"> A Chinese newspaper, which launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be overhauled, said a regulator of the press. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> The New Express newspaper based in Guangzhou, issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories of a semi-public company. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Now, the new Express will undergo a complete overhaul, &quot;said the Governor. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The &quot;realignment&quot; comes from the administration of Guangdon for press and publishing, radio, film and television. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several articles on incorrect listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> &quot;The drafting of new express was disorganized,&quot; said the regulator in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> He said that he had decided to &quot;impose an administrative sanction to Chen Yongzhou in him withdrawing his press card.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1148"> He also &quot;ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conducts an investigation to the responsible persons at New Express and re-plans immediately the newspaper&apos;s management team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Mr Chen wrote several articles for The New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a first appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television station, where he admitted to have published false stories for money. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> &quot;In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public,&quot; he told the public television network CCTV. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> I did so mainly because I was running after money and fame. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I realized my mistake. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Following the apology from Mr. Chen, New Express published an apology on its front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Several suspects have recently made televised confessions. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Experts say that people are routinely forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year forbidding the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Obama backtracked on its reform of the health system </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Under a barrage of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that &quot;if you&apos;re satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1160"> After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their providers, Republicans criticized the president in recent days, accusing it of misleading the American people. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Yesterday, Barack Obama has adjusted its original promise. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> &quot;The vast majority of people with health insurance that they can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Speaking of what he calls &quot;an effervescence in the news&quot; about the terminations, President Obama encouraged Americans who received the notice to look for a new insurance on the market. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Most people can get comprehensive health plans and better suited for the same price, or even cheaper than expected. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> &quot;You gain,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> The administration announced that one should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who get their insurance themselves were forced to change the regime, because they do not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> &quot;Let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better,&quot; said Kathleen widen during his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Ms widen), which oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch in October of the online market had &quot;failed miserably.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1169"> &quot;I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,&quot; she added. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> I look forward to regain your confidence. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It&apos;s a widen exasperated that pronounced the sentence, while she thought his microphone cut, through an assistant, seated behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative from Missouri, for whether it should join the Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to urge Ms widen why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounced the government sponsored insurance to buy a plan through healthcare. gov, it now boasts of millions of Americans. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers </seg>
<seg id="1174"> &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; by the Coen brothers, Grand Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village in 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film has been the subject of a retrospective at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise, had won the Palme d&apos;or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their vested on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> In this film, full of humor, where the music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac is a folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop to folk music with a contagious jubilation. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; for less glamorous clothes, a soft-spoken when she sings, but the expletive charged rampage when she speaks. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can&apos;t break through and get angry with the whole earth. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> He reluctantly accepts the replacements on the hoof in the studios. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> Homeless, he toured sofas of friends who still want to receive it. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> An air of documentary </seg>
<seg id="1183"> &quot;His relationship with success is tortured, this is what we wanted: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, which is not a careerist, but integrates with a self-destructive behaviour,&quot; said to the press, Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel several Oscars and prizes at Cannes. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time like the folk musician Dave von Ronk. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The idea was to show the time before the advent of Greenwich Village, New York headquarters to become &quot;the epicenter of the folk music boom that would lead to international stars,&quot; writes journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> The film then resemble a documentary, dusty music label invaded by 33 T sale-or-return inhabited by an old secretary hilarious, the musical choices of the studios of the era and the cafes of the singers. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The magic of the Coen Brothers operates by integrating a funny character who runs the film at all times: a magnificent red cat under craquant, companion of fortune as Llewyn Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having &quot;grew up in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1189"> &quot;My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> For Justin Timberlake, if the work is required to be considered as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;Chance can also launch the career of someone,&quot; and &quot;more and more today.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1191"> As Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, pop star explains that in a career, &quot;the most important thing is to not get caught in anything that can prevent us from Express.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, reported on Friday a drop in its quarterly profit due to the decline in refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the objectives of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> Its net profit for the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, up from 5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The analysts surveyed by Reuters expect, on average, a profit of $2.71 per share. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> The company is 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production by 2017. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> The major part of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Because of the cost of these projects, the annual capital expenditure increased from seven billion dollars in two years and expected to reach 36.7 billion dollars in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (refining and chemical production) dropped by 45% to $380 million. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> This decline in refining margins affects the whole of the sector. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit decline despite rising oil and gas production. </seg>

<seg id="1211"> The NSA snooping: The United States is &quot;Gone Too Far,&quot; Kerry </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The United States are sometimes went &quot;too far&quot; in terms of espionage, has recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession from Washington in the dispute with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA). </seg>
<seg id="1213"> After ten days of Scandal, Revelations and denials from the United States and its European allies, it is the first time that an official U.S. Government explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA&apos;s interception of communications and data in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> &quot;In some cases, I grant you, as president, some of these actions have gone too far, and we will ensure that it does not happen again in the future,&quot; said John Kerry, at a conference in London that he was from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> In his televised speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has largely justified the practice of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Citing the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had foiled several planned attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and information gathering. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> &quot;We have in fact prevented planes from falling, as buildings exploded and people were murdered, because we were in a position to be aware of these projects,&quot; argued the boss of American diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> And, said John Kerry for the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in this process of innocent people were not misled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1219"> But we are trying to gather information. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> &quot;And yes, in some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate manner,&quot; admitted the secretary of state, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> He assured on Thursday evening that President Obama was &quot;committed to try to clarify and that it was reviewing these practices so that nobody feels deceived.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1222"> But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> The newspaper, citing documents obtained from the NSA revelations of Edward Snowden, says the program called &quot;muscular&quot; and conducted with the NSA&apos;s British counterpart, GCHQ, allows the two agencies to collect data from the optical fibers used by internet giants. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> According one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the month of January-ranging from metadata on emails, text or audio or video. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> These interceptions would be held outside the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, revealed that the NSA had intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> To the anger of European states and the leaks in the US press said that the American president was not aware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama declined to speak on the matter, citing national security. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> However, the powerful boss of the NSA, Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, has denied that its intelligence agency has collected tens of millions of European citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services that would have to take these communications, before providing them to the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> This would include &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where Nato allies are cooperating with the United States, and it would certainly not Europe, said General Alexander. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> And the controversy was extended on Friday in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the US as part of a vast international spy network, which has also attracted the ire of China. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Early puberty: vieillir earlier </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Studies show that young african-american and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> The physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent </seg>
<seg id="1238"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1239"> The experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1240"> The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1241"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> A mother should worry if the breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow 7 or 8 years old? </seg>
<seg id="1243"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which took place this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, P√©do-endocrinologue, explained that these physical changes are fairly common among young American and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> The visible signs of development, such as budding breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But there was only a small step from the age of first menstruation in the past four decades. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when he was 12 years old three quarters in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> &quot;Once the chest started to grow, it is at least two or three years before the first appear,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The essential guide to coping with this common problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The time is the more accurate test to find out how to go through puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> There is a debate about what constitutes the real onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;early&quot; when breast development is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In most cases, development slows or stops-it is something that a pediatrician can follow closely. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> A more rapid evolution can justify tests conducted by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors and cysts. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There are treatments to delay the onset of first menstruation and prevent other consequences: a premature aging of the bones, which can dampen growth and a small adult size. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The recommendations on hormone therapy and are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs, but acknowledged that &quot;the control of puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and feel for young girls to be different from others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> The other big problem is understandable: the parents simply do not want their very young girls have their rules. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> &quot;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage health issues,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter had her first menstruation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn&apos;t prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> She returned from the school frightened and upset of being the first among his friends. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are many theories to the public on the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Still, there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The boys, as girls reach puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Kaplowitz says that the most credible theory is that of the obesity epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years old that binds the percentage of body fat at the onset of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> In this country, young african-american and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> At the global level, the mechanisms of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by everything from the weather, economic conditions through the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Another problem: that boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area, the trend towards early puberty Real is not as pronounced as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Other doctors attending the conference of the PAA emphasized the complexity of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> &quot;We must be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a P√©do-endocrinologue working at the Goryeb Children&apos;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their paediatrician on how to talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> &quot;It can mean having a conversation sooner than expected,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> If you stay calm, your child will respond well in general. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Girls with early puberty should be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life. </seg>

<seg id="1294"> From the evening of your release, you were on the set of the &quot;Antenne 2 P.M..&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> What are your memories of your release? </seg>
<seg id="1296"> In particular, in Beirut. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car, where I meet-without seeing it because he is black-Roger Auque. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> He told me that &quot;one is released,&quot; but I&apos;m not sure, and think that we can still be killed. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> One is very excited, but also very tense. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> This is war, and those who lead us are also very tight. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> They settle on the edge of a sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> There are Syrian military. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Then we arrive at the Hotel Summerland, where the press is present. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The French lead us to the French embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> It is the time of the first phone calls to the parents, family, friends, to the press... </seg>
<seg id="1306"> I remember taking a bath for one hour. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> And to have dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani. </seg>

<seg id="1312"> It lands at Orly. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Chirac, Prime Minister, is there. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> It&apos;s a little brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> There is an incredible scramble. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And much of the media. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> When I left there were three television channels. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> I go back and there are full. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Descending the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, this is all very emotional. </seg>

<seg id="1321"> The bikers, craving for photos and follow me to my home, where I have to do a little the police to prevent some up. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> The media pressure is enormous. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> It does not stop, we are well placed to know... </seg>
<seg id="1324"> But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is hard to comprehend. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Out of a hole and it is suddenly under the media spotlight. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It&apos;s a little complicated, a little violent, too complex to manage. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> But it was the hardest. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> On the day, I am to 8:00 p.m. the next day as I am on TV. </seg>

<seg id="1333"> It is not a meeting that does everything, but we know we can count on him, remember if necessary, that it is not left to ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> It is part of the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> I also met the intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> They asked me questions about the hostage-takers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> It was logical. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> I was not embarrassed. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Today, how do you react to the release of four hostages of Niger? </seg>
<seg id="1340"> I listen to what is said. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The debate on the ransom. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Few things annoy me, others less so. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> I try to separate the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as chairman of the association &quot;hostages of the world&quot; that allows me to put in the distance, and seems to me much more interesting to talk about. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> I wonder, for example, on the definition of resilience. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> I think there is a problem of semantics. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> He described the hostage taking of hostages &quot;politics&quot; - which is most often the case - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and get their hostage takers in front of the International Criminal Court. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> But who said that the hostages might also have access to justice? </seg>
<seg id="1350"> A court in The Hague is for it. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Why do we not say to hostage-takers &quot;you have violated the rules of war, such as those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1352"> It seems to me, however, legitimate, hit in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> This message is heard but not listened to, and that makes me angry. </seg>

<seg id="1378"> Still, the family refuses &quot;for financial reasons&quot; and the situation is blocked. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The case has been blown out of proportion, said Joel Canapa, the director of the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Rats, there are always had in the cities. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The deratification company makes two crossings a year, and increasingly, we, in our office, every request of inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> We have made since the end of last winter, 64. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The district has not abandoned, and the rats don&apos;t thrive in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, the deratification products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, one will not kill a kid. </seg>

<seg id="1393"> George Kerevan: the break-up of Europe gives the choice for Scots </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Another day, another disturbing history of independence. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> While it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde said the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it wasn&apos;t even in the headlines (and expected). </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Nor has anyone said that the EU Member States spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules when it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a persistent disregard of the rules would be a concession that Brussels could offer in exchange for what it wants to achieve from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> It is a story that is not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the canard that &quot;independence means the passport control&quot; more than 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Nevertheless, we forgot something interesting in this interpretation of a dusty old tale. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Why an independent Scotland should follow the instructions of Europe? </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Why share the yoke of London against Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Here&apos;s the real news about Europe: the great postwar plan to unify Europe is definitely dead. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Across Europe, parties which oppose the √ÖU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and came out of nowhere, brought together almost five million votes in federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled to the straitjacket on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that Europe has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The European system is rather poses to its Members of favourable exchange rates to German exporters - that German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe is faced with a problem of intrinsic productivity to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending-encouraged by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise in Europe linked to productivity. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> Following the &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - who are one reason to subsidize the French and German companies in the energy sector at the consumer&apos;s expense-European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times more for gas than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> All the pay freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a cheap American shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> As a result, the revolt looms, particularly in France, one of the major leaders of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> After the war, the French political elite has considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and Paris on an equal footing with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> But Berlin no longer needs from Paris as a passport for his political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to scramble. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> The result: the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Front Anti-european, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party who reminded him that he cannot assume that a split of the Right will automatically left. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> Marine Le Pen is doing with its new popularity among the white working class? </seg>
<seg id="1426"> She wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-monnaie and Anti-european bloc in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> If the anti-european parties are doing well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> That is what I think: very soon, the anti-european sentiment and anti-monnaie unique in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The EU will not disappear, but it will be something that is more like the &quot;Europe of Nations (sovereign)&quot; Free choice of General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> I expect that the UK should take away from this project, and I hope that it will be up to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> However, the growing interest from Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> And Scotland, in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1434"> We can choose to be a region of England (mostly). </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending promener Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I think Scotland could accommodate a European agreement over free on condition that we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a Europe of nations rather than federal law. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and retain our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> The SNP government in Scotland is - and it is - the anti-austerity political movement, which has been more successful in Europe, having won a most spectacular in 2011 based on his opposition to the deep cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> Now it would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> A house fire in Old </seg>
<seg id="1442"> A fire that broke out Friday afternoon in the old city was quickly controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to the street H√©bert 9. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The flames are reported in a house of three apartments spread over four floors, located behind the Court of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> All the tenants were absent during the fire. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> The fire was extinguished an hour after the arrival of firefighters, who were likely to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The alarms have succeeded, because it takes the reinforcements to attack the building, because it is glued buildings here,&quot; explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire. </seg>

<seg id="1454"> Entered in the 1,500 m √âlys√©ennes kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook has climbed the ranks to become Chief, nine years ago. </seg>

<seg id="1458"> &quot;I&apos;m from a Castle the other!&quot; jokes Bernard Vaussion, who is not only the foibles of the six presidents for whom he worked, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;It is still the head of state or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menu,&quot; he recalls. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> &quot;Mrs Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen,&quot; to the point that it had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee! </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Whatever the heads of state who had a relative indifference to the terrestrial foods, &quot;they are greedy,&quot; denounces gentiment Bernard Vaussion. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Jacques Chirac certainly had &quot;an appetite a little more developed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1463"> But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were returning empty! </seg>
<seg id="1464"> As for Fran√ßois Hollande, who restored the cheese, &quot;he is someone who loves to eat&quot; and &quot;there is not much he does not like.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1465"> The current head of state, which regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, did &quot;not request a specific plan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1466"> Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, particularly at state dinners at the Elys√©e: &quot;between 200 and 250 people in about an hour.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The night before is almost white. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> These people would not understand that there will be mistakes. </seg>

<seg id="1471"> &quot;His human side has emerged,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1477"> The Mayor Rob Ford was botched, says a lawyer </seg>
<seg id="1478"> After police confirmed they had a copy of the video to show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen a &quot;botched, too.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1479"> Ruby told me to believe in the Canadian Press that the police had &quot;ignored or minimized&quot; the evidence against the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> On Thursday, the police arrested the friend and occasional driver Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35, and charged with extortion in connection with the video. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> Alexander Lisi, previously convicted of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> The police said they also found the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Ruby has described me as &quot;inexplicable&quot; that the police never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his home, or eavesdropping on his phone, arguing that the Police Chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in own hands, might very well able to intercept the vehicle of Rob Ford, the mayor, and a Search-even without a mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> It could also require a warrant snapshot, if deemed necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The head of police has not commented, but his spokesman Mark Erdmann described the about Ruby me &quot;obvious and desperate attempt&quot; to the media in a case that is not the case at all. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said that there was nothing in this movie that can be &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; that could lead to the filing of criminal charges against the mayor. </seg>

<seg id="1493"> It deems &quot;scandalous&quot; information from the Washington Post, that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two companies to synchronize their servers. </seg>

<seg id="1507"> The grandmother had lit a cigarette at a gas leak. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The explosion of a residential unit in Gesves, who made two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty heater, said on Friday evening, the substitute of the King&apos;s prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> The expert sent by the prosecution that the origin of the explosion was purely accidental. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The grandmother has lit a cigarette when there was a leak and an accumulation of gas. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The life of the two victims is still committed. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> The grandmother was shown by the explosion and was badly burnt. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned over slightly. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> &quot;The two victims were intubated and packed on site before being taken to Cork University Hospital, the helicopter ambulance to him,&quot; said Mayor Jose Paulet, descended on the scene. </seg>

<seg id="1516"> Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remains intact, while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the Chairman of the Commission. </seg>

<seg id="1520"> A black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="1521"> While the planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure in disrepair, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The devices, which record all miles flown by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial effort in Washington and in government offices, planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main American roads. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> The sector generally, without interest, of the main planning suddenly provoked a lively debate and alliances sea-states. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The Libertarians joined environmental groups in order to exert pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you fly, and possibly of the road on which you drive, then use the information to prepare a draft law. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The tea party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And while members of Congress can&apos;t agree on whether he should continue, several States did not wait. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles flown. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS tracking system, for an experimental Vir√©e. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> This is really essential for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;It is not as if we had a choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state began recording the miles flown by each Californian motorist by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> There will be a change in how we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> The technology is there to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> The pressure comes from the fact that the highway trust fund, financed with taxes that Americans pay at the pump is dry financially. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> The Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Cars can travel more miles a gallon. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not increased over the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while gasoline prices are high. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;The gasoline tax is simply not tenable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> His state has recently installed plotters on 500 cars to test a system of payment to the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> &quot;It is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Wonks call it user fees to the mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> It is not surprising that the idea for attracting urban liberals, since the fees could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Planners of California is interested in as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the ambitious legislation on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But the Representative Bill Shuster (R-PA.), chairman of the transportation committee of the House of Representatives, said that he considered as the most viable alternative in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers a mile. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> &quot;He is not just a tax spirals into a big black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> People pay more for their benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move in the direction of the payment to the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> But the House killed the proposal, responding to concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or in the city. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Several states and large cities are still in progress. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry the most important experience of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> These motorists will soon pay the state Cordouan fees instead of taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The City of New York is considering a.. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The concept is not a universal success. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> In Nevada, where about 50 motorists volunteers recently equipped their cars with a device, the drivers were worried that the government can track their movements. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> &quot;The concern about Big Brother and stuff like that are a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic management of the performance at the Nevada Department of Transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> It is not something that people want. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> At the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to convert these devices into tracking devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1564"> It is not necessary to build a huge technological infrastructure and cumbersome that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people&apos;s daily comings and goings. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Nevada is one of the few states that are struggling now to find an affordable technology that would enable the state to know how many miles a vehicle travels, but without knowing the place or the exact time. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> If we can do it, &quot;added Khan, citizens will be more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-ups in the name of true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Originally, the company did not help motorists who pay taxes to the states. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> She was looking to break into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But the devices they tested enjoyed the main planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically via modem. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;People will be more inclined to do that if you don&apos;t record their speed and don&apos;t find them,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, director general of true mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Big mistakes were made in pilot programs in some states. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> There are far less expensive and far less intrusive methods. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> In Oregon, the planners trying experience by providing motorists with various choices. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> They can choose a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Other states hope to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a system of taxation that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide an insurance payment &quot;to conduct&quot; and create a set of data on the real-time speed from the other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> &quot;Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,&quot; said a document on urban development. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> However, some transportation planners are wondering whether the whole debate on the Payment to the mile is not just a huge distraction. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the Bay Area of San Francisco, officials say that the Congress could just manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> A single or additional annual fee could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of fuel, so that everyone pays their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;It is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when simply need aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs from the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> If it does this, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned with the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> The British police issued a warrant for the extradition of Assange </seg>
<seg id="1586"> The British police has today issued a warrant for the extradition of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London and requested political asylum. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Scotland Yard said it had issued a &quot;notice of surrender&quot; against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Assange could be extradited to Sweden on sex crime allegations, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London on June 19, calling for South American countries for political asylum. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Scotland Yard has issued a &quot;notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, the date and time of his choice,&quot; said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> The embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he could be accused of spying, after unveiling more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the Wikileaks website battling the secret information. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Letta is confident in the longevity of his government </seg>
<seg id="1595"> The Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said that his Government will take until 2015 despite the high tensions between the left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the vote in the Senate to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> In an interview with the daily newspaper La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he &quot;fully intends&quot; to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former council president sentenced for tax fraud in August. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw support to the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, addressed his removal. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> But one part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL), Angelino Alfano, continues to support the Government, as demonstrated on 2 October his refusal to yield to the demands of Berlusconi, who is already wanted to bring down the cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For more than a year, everywhere, I see a lot of resentment from the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of fees, cost of all kinds, administrative costs. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In short, unlimited back-siphonage from our pockets. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Millions of dollars could be saved squandered so much taxation respectful of those who pay. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Any money forcibly abducted to taxpayers decreased their consumption and contributes to their impoverishment. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, is not shy about spending lavishly and maintenance of lame ducks: Deficit, strong cultural centre grant to the City of Energy, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> If these facilities are not profitable, sold to private enterprise or demolish them. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that never came. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I will, however, give an honourable mention in the transformation of the old Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers? </seg>
<seg id="1608"> It is not the public to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> The citizens were happy to learn that the lakes for fishing and batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Following the departure of all industries (major water users) and the general population decline, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Without wanting to say of the waste, the city will never water and harsh regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> In short, it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without going through a debt settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> We run for more than 40 years by Cravat√©s with beautiful diplomas for most, and I do not believe that a sheep rancher is worse. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> A worker dies buried under concrete blocks </seg>
<seg id="1617"> A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks, on Thursday morning, in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> The tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m., the Marquette Street, near the intersection of the rue Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-petite-patrie. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> In all likelihood, the work done on the foundations were in place for some time. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> A mitoyen foundation wall had been erected in recent days. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> I was in the car and I saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives close to the site. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> I landed and I went to remove large bricks that covered it. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> There was only one part of his back, it&apos;s so unfortunate. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> According to the authorities, the victim was a man aged in his fifties who worked for a company of formwork. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Resuscitation manoeuvres were tempted by the emergency services, but without success. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The man did not survive his serious injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> An inspector from the health and safety of the work has been dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The NES is an &quot;Internal Error&quot; and not from hackers to the outage of its site </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The National Security Agency working in the shadows, said on Friday that it was a bug that caused the outage of its public website for a few hours, and not from hackers as some had argued. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;N.O.S. gov/inf/2007 has remained elusive for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; said the spy agency in a statement by email. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> The problem will be resolved this evening. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Claims that the outage was due to a distributed denial of service attack [ DSD ] are false. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Earlier this evening, the trackers of online servers noted that the NSA had been broken for at least six hours, and some users were still unable to access the site. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was &quot;not at all&quot; compromise. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> No classified information is at risk, explained the spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> At least one group of hacktivists online said to be responsible for the failure of the NES by an attack. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> The DSD attacks designed to flood a target website until the servers are overloaded and collapses. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The cyber-tactique is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the system&apos;s internal network. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> The NSA used secret Ultra, a time known as &quot;No Such Agency&quot; has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications monitoring programs at home and abroad - that are part of the NSA&apos;s secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the disillusioned former consultant of the NSA, Edward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The growing controversy over the agency has caused much speculation that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted Cyber-op√©ration. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The delta city centre now closed </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The Delta Hotel City Centre closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The investment fund that owned the building has been sold to developers who would turn it into student residences. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Three hundred and fifty people were working at the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Of these, 200 have still not found a new job. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Delta promises not to let down his employees. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Employers came to meet directly, it met individually with employees to assess their needs. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;It Support-l√† will continue for the next six months,&quot; explains the Director of Labour Relations of Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The closure of the Delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> The investment fund that owned that B√¢tisse-l√† had choices to make. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate, so there was investment of tens of millions, while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have emerged in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> &quot;Or is he sold it to someone else, and that is what happened,&quot; explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Chair in Tourism Transat at the School of Management Sciences. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next few months, as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for elderly people. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be added in the next two years. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> You want an ice Fluo-3? </seg>
<seg id="1657"> A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world of jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists recreate chemically brilliant protein. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the PH of the protein to make it sparkle. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Chris says that, since ice cream starts to shine when she responds to the heat of the mouth, licks, it&apos;s brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Charlie, the founder of the Society of Ice &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious,&quot; said: &quot;It&apos;s something amazing, but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g this thing costs about ¬£ 200.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the PH neutral language. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> So when your mouth warms the protein, the ph level rises and the ice starts to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> We have tested over recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everybody at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> It is probably the most expensive ice that I created because the luminescent jellyfish worth four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Each ball costs me about 140 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> But she is rather good taste! </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> But her next creation, promises to be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> He added: &quot;I would really like to develop an invisible ice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1672"> It is intrinsically impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that form the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> ICE uses the fluorescent properties of the M√©duse synthesized by Chinese scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> One seriously injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring </seg>
<seg id="1675"> A road accident has a seriously injured Friday morning around 5:30 a.m., on the inner ring of Brussels to height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> A driver&apos;s car was hit by a ghost driver, which is free. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m., at the place of the accident until the road is cleared and that an expert to determine the circumstances of the accident. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> This situation has, however, caused traffic jams because the accident took place at the height of the Exit Hoeilaart.. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Traffic had to be diverted by this outward/inward ring. </seg>

<seg id="1685"> Snowden is ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany on the issue of the American surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence services, said he was ready to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide responses about their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> German MP hans-christian √ñBELE met Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where it enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> In a letter that the member has presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: &quot;Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to criminalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> However, the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> In the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of government property. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Hans-peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, said at the time: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make that possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Relations between the United States and Germany were strained following complaints that the NSA was eavesdropping on the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness &quot;without putting in danger and completely ruin relations with the United States,&quot; they should take advantage of. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Mr. √ñBELE, German Green MP, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Mr. √ñBELE said, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden would not return to Russia if he left the country. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, it would give him the assurance that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of persecution &quot;serious and sustained&quot; that had forced him to leave his country. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1701"> The citizens of the world as well as senior officials - including in the United States - have found that the revelation of a mysterious system of permanent monitoring of public usefulness. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The letter suggests an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1703"> A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York, has identified a new species of humpback dolphins off the northern coast of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Thibaut bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Centre for Conservation and Study of animals and marine environments (oceamm) returns to express this discovery and explains the lengthy process of identifying new species. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin √âtonne-t you? </seg>
<seg id="1706"> This is good news, but it does not surprise me. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> In the past, when the species were described and identified based on morphological, anatomical and, today, the development of new tools such as genetics will allow us to improve our knowledge of the species classification. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology is challenging the classification or membership of a species to a genre, a family, or even an order. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified the animals, based on morphological differences among species. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Today, some of these rankings are challenged because of advances in genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> Similarly, two very close morphologically species were identified through genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> This is the case of the new species, which has just been identified. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> He said a decade ago, the scientific community recognized both species from this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and humpback whales in the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> Recent analyses of four distinct species. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Why is this an important discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society? </seg>
<seg id="1716"> From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> If this population was already long been known by the researchers, they did not know that she was part of a new species, introduced only here. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> A species is considered threatened or endangered, according to the number of people existing on earth, i.e. the stock, and the ability to recover from the neighbouring stocks. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> In terms of the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species is discovered, its stock is automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals? </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> They live in homogenous habitats, open, where there are many genetic exchange between populations and individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The mixing of genes to limit the creation of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote reproductive isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> He should know that the marine environment is the least well known. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> One prefers sending robots to Mars, which lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 miles from the surface of the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> More money is spent in the search for life on other planets and in marine research and it is high time to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Clive Palmer claims that the MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to the system of parental leave. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> MP billionaire Clive Palmer argues that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to the system of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> The mining magnate, who is contesting the payment of a carbon tax in the amount of $6m, argues that argument to try to remove the questions about a possible conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes must be removed. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers might have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Abbott&apos;s daughters were ready to benefit from these policies. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> &quot;He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact that she gets a leave or not,&quot; Mr Palmer said. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after a recount. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Palmer has put forward the idea of an overhaul of the system of remains of votes to speed the process. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Tony Abbott&apos;s daughters, Frances and Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> This election should be decided two months after the vote is completed? </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We need a better system,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, seize your contact information in a computer, to vote immediately and to have the result at 6:30 the next morning? </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils on paper to mark the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree? </seg>
<seg id="1744"> Today, to have a pencil seems extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> The Electoral Commission has studied the options for electronic voting, and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he would assume his new responsibilities &quot;very seriously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The performance of public duties is a question of public service. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> &quot;We are not seeking reward, except for history, because we need to serve the community at a critical time,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> When many experts in equestrian events met in Cardiff to compete for and win the trophy of the horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be fierce. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> But no one expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Not yet in school and only a few months after his first, the toddler and his Shetland pony toffee low-hanging have during the three rounds with great ease and won first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> The two inseparable - that are the same size - were welcomed for the presentation, the attitude and style at the annual competition, which took place at the equestrian centre Sunnybank Rudry, near Cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> Running against men and women in bowler hats, he wore his hat a little on the flat side of a relaxed way to scroll through his 2-year-old toffee pony around the track. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural qualities of dressage, not common for a child her age. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> And Toffee has received very good marks for his presentation and his personality. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has since led with his Shetland pony every day. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Her mother Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and toffee are a great duo.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1758"> They went against all odds, but both won the Gold Cup and the rosette. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> It was only the second time that he serves with toffee and we were crazy with joy that he had won. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> On the runway, people who do not know him thought it was so dramatic that they wanted to be photographed with him. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, south Wales, follows in the footsteps of her aunt Sharon Howells, who participates in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Ms Howells said: &quot;There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> He walked the entire length of the runway and, even if he seemed to be very small, he has done a wonderful job. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Fenton is crazy animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and two chickens. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> How it began, he will surely soon to the demonstration of the horse of the year - and I am sure he will do a good performance. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: &quot;Fenton was only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1767"> They are a good team. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The judges noted that Fenton and toffee did and how they paraded on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> They want effective teamwork between the ponies and the Horsemaster-Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> I am sure that his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was so proud. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> Defence Minister Rob Nicholson, insisted that the injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all the soldiers before their return to civilian life. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> Attacked by liberals and Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the military followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> All the wounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before it was ready, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing the injured - who do not meet the rule of &quot;universal service&quot; of the army demanding that staff will be able to conduct a series of varied tasks - to reach the qualifying period of 10 years required for retirement benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian press, one of them a soldier released last Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome, was discharged from the army despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed pensions. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed towards the exit before being ready because he did not meet the requirement of universality of service. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with the plans and consultation sessions, but it was totally different as wishing to leave the ranks. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> &quot;I told them I wasn&apos;t ready,&quot; he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Since the beginning of the major battles in Afghanistan, the army is struggling to determine what latitude they can award to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Under current rules, the soldiers seriously injured have up to three years to recover. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the military. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Data presented last year in Parliament show that among 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service for pension benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The Liberal spokesman for veterans, Jim Karygiannis, requested on Wednesday the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to &quot;this shameful practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Air raid against military installations in Syria </seg>
<seg id="1787"> According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> A shipment of short-range surface-to-air missiles his IPC-8 have been targeted and destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> This new Israeli air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz) has been confirmed by both Israel and Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The raid took place in circumstances virtually identical to the one that took place on July 5: At the time, it is also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time shore-to-sea Yakhont missiles, supplied by Russia in Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Life Imprisonment for a former Chinese vice governor </seg>
<seg id="1793"> A former vice-governor of Jilin Province in northeast China, was sentenced on Friday to life in prison for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian xueren was accused of having received more than 19 million yuan in bribes, the official Chinese media. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Between 1995 and 2001, the Governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, has helped companies and officials to get contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the First Intermediate Court in Beijing on his microblog. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, arguing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> If the Head of State promised that justice would be so inflexible with the powerful &quot;tigers&quot; and &quot;flies&quot; - junior officers-only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former executives from oil giant Petrochina. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life imprisonment in September for corruption and abuse of power after he referred to the highest office in the state. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> But the government has no intention to reform the system of combating corruption, for example by creating an independent body of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Bombardier&apos;s profit drops, while shipments and orders for aircraft are receding </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Bombardier Inc., Aerospace and Rail manufacturer, reported a fall of 15% of its net income on Thursday, under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its rail division. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not provide any flight test data for its new Cseries aircraft nor information on whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial service until next September. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> After the maiden flight of the test plane about a month and a half, he stole only three times, and the question was raised whether the test phase was on track. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The results were not up to the expectations and stock prices fell by 8% in the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday its rating from &quot;Outperform&quot; to &quot;Sector Performance&quot; due to the potential upside of the stock market in the next quarter or the next two quarters. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;While the decline in aircraft deliveries had been largely anticipated, we are very disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,&quot; Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its cseries aircraft, as the flight test program. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> However, if no new order is announced in the next few months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Bombardier hopes that the cseries family of aircraft will catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> But the number of firm orders for the C-series aircraft is small so far, up from 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company&apos;s assertions regarding energy efficiency and potential cost savings of the new airliner. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Currently, the Company has recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief executive, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the Commercial Service of the first plane. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday, saying that the program progressed according to schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> &quot;The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Mr. Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the time out of the plane. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Each manufacturer plans in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> We had decided to proceed with a first flight and to provide an update, and it is what we have done. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> It will be repeated throughout the flight programme. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow soon after, the company said. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> However, analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first client to make stealing a cseries plane just 12 months after its maiden flight. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Bombardier said it was assessing the timing of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> &quot;This slow flight tests-although it appears to be consistent with internal schedule of Bombardier-reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Mr. Doerksen said. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&apos;s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> Adjusted Earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Revenues declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion. </seg>

<seg id="1926"> Not to mention a certain taste for risk: those who did not hesitate to pose nude on the glossy paper will appear in more nonsulfur situations on the big screen. </seg>

<seg id="1928"> If the filmmaker provocateur has asked his players to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to the x for the sex scenes the most daring, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the waist is the star; below, the liner. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Bj√∂rk&apos;s Charlotte Gainsbourg, Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has used to push his players to their limits, always for the better. </seg>

<seg id="1932"> At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking to him at present, </seg>
<seg id="1933"> I was so afraid of forgetting, or rather I didn&apos;t know how I am going to keep on going. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> There is no recipe for moving the wall of invisible and reunited with his family. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Then signs have emerged. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> The first time it has been a very strong sense of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch its shows that leaves me more, raised on the night table. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> It is the image of my father smiled with me in my day-to-day actions. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Our mother died after his gruelling fight against cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> At least that is what I thought when I found his body tensed vacuum on the hospital bed, crumpled linen. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Similarly, his funeral was a bitter farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> I thought that it was a party. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> Little by little, through small diurnal and nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly turned back in my mind, as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in mourning. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> And then, it is revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet collected, masked by my relationship with her. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> So I learned and understood that I had lost any person from my mother, but simply a woman I didn&apos;t know really, a woman who embodied this person, during his stay in the life. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> In dying, this woman had a perfect life and released the person I loved, and I found myself, and full. </seg>

<seg id="1948"> It is a privilege to know that people loved never leave us. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> I look like my father, &quot;on the inside as on the outside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1950"> They always told me. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> I never believed it at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> I had difficult relations with him until he becomes old, sick. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> There, I was scared of him and I love him. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> One day, he died. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking when I was afraid when I was wrong... </seg>
<seg id="1956"> He spoke to me, encouraged me constantly, he lived on my body. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> I saw his hands in mine, I paid him with my body. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> But it was never intrusive. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> I was able to have a personal life. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> He left me my privacy. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> It lasted long and then one day he left. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, supported, advised. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> I do not know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> My parents are over, but I constantly feel about me. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence, because I always refer: What would you have said? What Would They Think? - they have done? </seg>
<seg id="1966"> I constantly dream of them, perhaps not all nights, but several times a week. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> I often dream of the last moments that I share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from doing this time. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> I wake often anxious when it happened to me and I feel deeply for their absence. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Sometimes I have dreams to the contrary and are part of my history and, indeed, they continue to live and to share my life. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> On the eve of my ultrasound, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I woke, I hissais out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the stage and I smiled and welcomed a baby boy. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep, indicating to me that he shared with joy. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> And, of course, it was a small boy in my belly. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> I liked to share this moment with him, and I am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> A year ago, it was on a trip with my family in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> That is to say the shock of his disappearance caused the youngster that I was at the time. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> In spite of everything, I realized my grief quickly enough. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> But it continues to influence my life, especially in the moments when I find myself in trouble or when I have to take important decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> Learn Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to be a master in a great school, were not, with hindsight, trivial choices. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> The values she taught me are always present, so sometimes I think about how she would like me, whether at a given time. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The same goes for my attitude: I try to match the generosity and goodness of spirit of that which was a fervent believer. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Now, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, an uplifting spirit. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> I see her eyes on me. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> My mother died there nineteen years now. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Dead after speaking by telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> I went through all the phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that activate only, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Then, time has eased the pain. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Only the lack, so empty without a response, it needs it, to assign me, reassure me at the bottom of its sweetness. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Nevertheless, it is there, silent presence, she is there and watching me. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Every morning, I see his eyes worried arise on me, I see the rings that add to her eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, which folds the front the concern. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> And every morning, I look away. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> One feels for its protection, nothing terrible can happen to us. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> It was his promise to his bed of pain, then it was slowly relearned to smile and pronounce her name is no longer taboo, but a comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Of course, I talk to him in the hollow of the night when the absence is too badly, it is in my dreams when morale is a little achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> We also feel encouraged and protected in difficult moments, the passage of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to remain on the path mapped out for us. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> If you liked to be very strong, the absence can you tear the hearts and memories. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> In some ways, the loved one becomes your inner energy. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of an asbestos-related cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he was thinking or what he appreciated. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> I could not attend his funeral, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a boy. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> If I have my beliefs may be different, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his view of things. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> I also had problems in my work for these beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> For me, it is impossible to go in an opposite direction, I do not sleep, and I still wonder what they will think. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> I do not know if I adopted it or if I&apos;m just like him: Is it genetic? </seg>
<seg id="2008"> In any case, it will always be my reference. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk among ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> In short, he is there on a daily basis. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> I feel his presence, and that makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> Here almost thirty years that my husband has died at the age of 33. </seg>

<seg id="2015"> Very often it &quot;landed&quot; in my dreams, so precise, so alive that alarm clock I am sad to see that it was only a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, I say &quot;I&quot; but a voice so real that I woke up with a jolt, anxious and I turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it would happen. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> I still live in the same house, and often, I feel, and I turn to see if he is not there, I know it&apos;s him and talk to him. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> In all the pieces I feel his presence, and that makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> For anything in the world I cannot leave this house where we were pleased and or its spirit lives with me. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> I am 58 years old, I always lived alone since his departure, it is and will remain the love of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> I would like to clarify that I am a sociable with responsibility, I laugh and I sang, I go out, I&apos;m a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him, and I never spoke to him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery. </seg>

<seg id="2103"> Pitcairn wants to create the world&apos;s largest marine reserve </seg>
<seg id="2104"> Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced on Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, citing information from Radio Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> This territory is 47 km, while there were three other small islands nearby. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> He is British, since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, episode in the history of the British navy, which led to three Hollywood adaptations. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> Dozens of people, most of them descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their revenues depend on 95% of the generosity of London. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The Island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago, 836.000 km that correspond to its exclusive economic zone. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> An assistant to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate the request. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a zone would be a first step towards more fiscal autonomy for the island. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> The creation of a marine reserve would allow the UK to enshrine these 836.000 km, but only if we have the means to monitor, which is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring of the zone, and there is no port where the placement of military ships. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> As for France, it must now undertake the very costly aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million sq km of the EEZ of French Polynesia, Pitcairn&apos;s neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Greece: two killed in a shooting near a local neo-nazi party </seg>
<seg id="2117"> Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots fired by two people who were aboard a motorcycle that passed in front of a room of the neo-nazi party Golden Dawn in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> The police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had argued that the victims were their local guards. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> Officers from the anti-terrorist unit were dispatched to the Central Avenue in the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and have cordoned off the area. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six members of the Golden Dawn, whose leader and founder of the party, for involvement in a &quot;criminal organization&quot; as part of a campaign against the party after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> The parents of a Georgia teenager who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered </seg>
<seg id="2124"> The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a rolled wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his school, believe that their son was killed, said the family&apos;s lawyer on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, stuck in a carpet standing behind the bleachers of the school&apos;s gymnasium. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Sheriff&apos;s investigators in Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> &quot;They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on foxnews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> They never thought that he was dead, as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> &quot;They think that it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense,&quot; said Crump. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> They are confident that these findings were delivered only to cover the person or persons responsible for the death of their son. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> &quot;They sent their son to school with a binder and is paid in a mortuary bag,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Johnson, pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> What is the cause of death? </seg>
<seg id="2134"> His death is the result of a criminal act? </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Moore spoke at a news conference on Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> I will follow the facts wherever they lead. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> My goal is to discover the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> &quot;I consider that there is a sufficient basis&quot; to open an official investigation, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2140"> However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> &quot;Several questions deserve an answer or confirmation,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> Moore added that he has evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson, he will ask the FBI to carry it out. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> The representative of the office of sheriff in Lowndes County was not available for comment when contacted on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> A Georgia judge ordered on Wednesday the authorities to hand over all the CCTV recordings that investigators had examined. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> The teenager&apos;s parents said they hoped that the video images contain clues about the circumstances of her death. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery </seg>
<seg id="2147"> M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War but never found him, was buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel in Bild. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> M√ºller did not survive to the end of the war. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> &quot;His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin,&quot; he told the mass circulation daily based on archival material. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would address one of the great enigmas of the post-war era. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> The German secret service, the BND, as well as during the summer of 1949, M√ºller in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> The Secret Service is totally wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> &quot;From August 1945, M√ºller&apos;s body was found in a grave near the former Provisional Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a commando,&quot; according to Mr. Tuchel. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> He was wearing &quot;a uniform.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2155"> &quot;In the inner pocket left included his service with a photograph,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> Bild also published a document from the mayor of the district of Mitte district of Berlin, indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the District. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> The President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> One of the most brutal Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> &quot;One crowd estimate24 of the memory of the victims,&quot; he threw up in the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Heinrich M√ºller is part of the major figures of the Third Reich who were never caught. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He took part in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the &quot;Final Solution&quot; and under his command was Adolf Eichmann, Head of the &quot;logistics&quot; of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Egypt calls on the first freely elected president sworn in </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mohamed Morsi swore the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt,&quot; when he took the oath of the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mr Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state to Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> He was sworn in in front of the 18 judges in black robes of the court whose building located at the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> &quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life ‚Äì absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarding the building where Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and scored from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow for the passage of his convoy in the busy streets linking the city centre to the South suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Regarded as the &quot;spare wheel&quot; charismatic Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has expanded considerably since its victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to portray himself as the only candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern,&quot; said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with wood when he was sworn in. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University, where he delivered his inaugural speech. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> It was officially welcomed by a military band that played the National Anthem while he stood at attention. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the chant &quot;The people and the army, hand in hand...&quot; intoned by thousands of people gathered in the auditorium of the University. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Founded in 1908, and a former stronghold of the secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Mr Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian regime of Hosni Mubarak last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former president ousted, the dispossessed. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> But by agreeing to formally swear an oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the will of the military by showing that the power struggle is not over. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Mr. Morsi&apos;s speech on Tahrir Square has been accompanied by dramatic populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> Aircraft manufacturers are arguing over the width of the seats so that large orders are at stake </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The dispute has raged between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in Tourist Class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow, which takes place a month. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> The conflict is about the width of seats on long-haul flights to passengers in economy class - which is not always the most courted by the airlines, but the space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft made by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> This week, Airbus has called on the aviation industry to develop a standard for imposing a siege of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its big American rival Boeing said that it should be up to the airlines to decide. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> The dispute erupted as manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping a record of orders at the event, which will be held from November 17 to 21. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> How the seats will be placed at the back of the plane - in particular, there will be 9 or 10 seats in front - is critical to the economic performance of the &quot;mini-jumbo segment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Boeing said that its &quot; 777&quot; refitted to accommodate Economy Class 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide and will be configured with 10 seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 will carry in economy class seat 350 people in 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The aviation giants often exchanging blows on technical issues by advertising in the press. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777 x should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> It was discovered recently in what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, &quot;Would you?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2192"> &quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats in the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus commercial director. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As dietary habits change, people grow, but the seats on planes have not dramatically changed. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the jumbo Boeing 747 has defined the modern long-haul trip, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 has increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The size of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the American health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Airbus said that its rival is clinging to a concept that dates to the 1950s, when the circumference of the freshly device called &quot;jet set&quot; was more closely. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Airbus says it has commissioned a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53%. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus with regard to the width of the seats and maintains that it is not the builders to decide how the airlines cut ticket prices and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience depends not only on the width of the seats. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> &quot;It really is to provide the flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think they need to conduct their activities,&quot; said Kent Walld, in charge of the Boeing passenger satisfaction. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> They do not want to be told what they will be profitable. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> They know their business better than anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> For passengers, it is better to have a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers is increasingly an issue that could affect their performance. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Behind the dispute lies a race for orders for aircraft at an estimated cost of at least $700,000 to the market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance by headquarters in their latest models of twin-engine long-haul 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300er of 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> The performance announced by Boeing will partly depend on the comparison between the 777 x configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of Origin set in rows of 9. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The gain in terms of unit costs is small compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> &quot;Boeing is going to be able to squeeze more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, director of passenger comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing M777 suggests that many passengers were in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,&quot; said the expert in interior cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor in chief of Runway Girl network. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Airbus and Boeing does not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Sellers of aircraft that circle the world prevail, even with a metre to verify the competing configurations. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> While extolling comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with higher density configurations for low-cost airlines and regional travel. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Airbus is offering the A350 configured with 10 seats per row, but says he has not yet sold. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for greater customization of booths offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft. </seg>

<seg id="2237"> First, there is the &quot;musical events&quot; that evolve to producers... </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Some use of beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille. </seg>

<seg id="2301"> November 1 deadline set by the organization, based in The Hague ordered in Damascus to destroy or &quot;render inoperable&quot; all chemical weapons production units and machines used to mix the toxic gases and ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> They think that the country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin. </seg>

<seg id="2315"> The Observatory said on Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but gave no explanation. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the inspectors in charge of chemical weapons when they need to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that, under tight deadlines. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> A statement by the OPCW, which works in close collaboration with the United Nations, indicated that his team was &quot;now satisfied to have controlled - and destroyed-all critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2328"> Two employees of the YMCA, accused of sexual assault allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Two employees of the YMCA of South Wales were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the royal commission on child sexual abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> But in his opening statement to the Committee, the YMCA stated that he &quot;never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2331"> The Director General Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: a YMCA employee has been charged with offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Mr. o&apos;hare told Gail Furness, senior counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case, but that he was not aware of the second. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> He also admitted that the YMCA&apos;s opening statement was incorrect in stressing, &quot;YMCA external controls were conducted and indicated that children&apos;s safety was a top priority for the organization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It was shown to the commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the worst ratings on four institutions in an audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Mr. o&apos;hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the Personnel Management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any breach of the security policy. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> He was sentenced to six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> But he rejected the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing the staff to report breaches of Lord to the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Staff members have testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, sat her on his lap, told them he loved them and left them playing with his mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Danielle Ockwell, which was overseen by Lord and who had requested training on child protection because she worried about her conduct, said she found the head of children&apos;s services in the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which covered Lord &quot;very intimidating and difficult to reach most of the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2341"> The Director General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report such violations to their supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Instead, he said that the friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, so that they do not have reported his actions. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Mr. o&apos;hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA of South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson of &quot;the Jonathan Lord incident&quot; should not be &quot;reporting&quot; by the staff, and the Board had agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Mr. Hare has said that the decision to staff to sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director General of the YMCA for children&apos;s services, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> He said the decision was designed to prevent contamination of evidence, but that it was an &quot;excess of zeal&quot; and that she had been poorly implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> The YMCA of South Wales was not a reliable organization for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the commission. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, screening, training and supervision of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The hearing was adjourned until December 20. </seg>

<seg id="2356"> In his book The Death in ashes, Damien the Guay, philosopher and vice-chairman of the National Committee of Ethics of the funeral home, stresses the &quot;violence&quot; of the cremation, for the survivors. </seg>

<seg id="2358"> There is also a &quot;symbolic violence&quot;, which is the &quot;erasure of the unique and distinctive signs&quot; reduced to the &quot;anonymity&quot; of ashes. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Why what is accepted in some Nordic countries and Protestant, is it still lived in France? </seg>
<seg id="2360"> &quot;Because the cremation is new,&quot; said Marie-fr√©d√©rique Bacqu√©, president of the Society of thanatology and author of the book &quot;Taming death. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> It is tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it. </seg>

<seg id="2365"> Now, 73% of those who chose cremation want to organize a ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> 66% of atheists or believers want too. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Crematoriums have adapted to the evolution of society. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> &quot;For a decade, they are trying to prevent family violence to wait, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the presentation of the Ashes,&quot; Mr. Michaud-n√©rard observed. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> 70% of schools now offer masters of ceremonies, which are, in the presence of the body, the ritual: hosting the Assembly, appoint the deceased, the link to the other, the raise, give meaning to her death, organizing the farewell. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> This is the case at the crematorium of Pere Lachaise, since 1998. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The Masters of Ceremonies are often people who have switched. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> There are also old Catholic priests. </seg>

<seg id="2409"> This discharge sound and energetic, long, if it can, eventually muffle and numb. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> So has the regularity of the visual rhythm. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> There are some nice flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as these that is ruffling hair or black fabrics, which prolong the lines. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> But the lack of choreographic composition. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, emerged with his tics. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The result: The bodies appear in front of the drawings. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Inks Michaux, as forms of gestalt, open a broader imagination swamps that dance, more porous. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Only the late, negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly Black Theatre, touches on the magic. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> The public liked, the reception was warm. </seg>

<seg id="2419"> The scene is partly gray cummerbund, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, furniture in an abandoned house. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> At the piano, the dancers take turns to play the partitions. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Their music, touching awkwardness, give a real fragility. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> On stage, the couples, love duets, very sensual, even erotic. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Group work, small transitions solos, ensembles, choruses, the writing is less binary. </seg>

<seg id="2439"> Report: The Obama campaign Considered Dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The closest advisors of President Barack Obama, in the utmost secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in 2012, according to The New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and said on Thursday evening that the president&apos;s close aides had conducted &quot;extensive work in groups and polls end 2011&quot; to see if the eviction of Biden could help Obama in his re-election as its hopes have dwindled. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> According to the Times political correspondent jonathan martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior officials of the campaign and the White House, the former secretary general of the White House, Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-president by the former Secretary of State Clinton on the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded in the campaign headquarters in Chicago, and inside the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Only half a dozen of the president&apos;s closest advisors - including Daley, the former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe-knew that the change was under review. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> &quot;Double Down&quot; indicates that Daley has led the charge to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship,&quot; before eventually deciding against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot;does not improve significantly the chances of success of Obama.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> &quot;I said that I had discussed a series of issues, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley said at the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we said,&apos; Lord, what can we do? </seg>
<seg id="2450"> While Daley described the review as &quot;cooperative,&quot; Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in order to find out whether the change would benefit at the polls. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking measures,&quot; said Martin on AC 360. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of a possible reshuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> While Daley has said he does not believe that the president &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former secretary general has admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; final did not respond to the question of whether the political polls had arrived at the Obama office. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden&apos;s presidential list was discussed. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> &quot;Maybe,&quot; replied Martin. </seg>

<seg id="2465"> A feast for fans </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Not tired of surprises, David Bowie was more a trick in his bag with the next day. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> The Thin White Duke was expected to repeat this album, on 4 November. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> For the occasion he has concocted a real feast for his fans. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three discs: the original album, previously unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four already unearthed clips. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the deluxe edition, five songs specially for the occasion, and two remixes. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> David Bowie has made presentations in this beautiful box in a video. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> There are introduced at the time each of the discs, but also the accessories: photos and exclusive sleeves, a blog to share his own impressions, a booklet with lyrics... </seg>
<seg id="2473"> And, most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of the next day, with guitars very forward and an electricity rock cleverly controlled. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Previously unreleased listening </seg>
<seg id="2475"> But Atomica is not the only way to reveal its charms. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> The information, like a rocket man, born in a UFO is also available on the Web. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The double-sided: Is a Worrying Ma√Ætris√©s before a cavalcade of light that gradually slows to a pop ballad. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> On Like a Rocket Man, Bowie he wanted to make a small reference to Rocket Man Elton John or even gravity? </seg>
<seg id="2479"> With the playful title, the singer seems to be in his element when he has his feet on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Space Oddity, meanwhile, was much more serious. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> About born in a UFO, David Bowie is once again referred to his strangeness: It would come from another planet? </seg>
<seg id="2482"> The guitar riffs, haunting, want to leave the land. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these securities: In turn informer, Man on a rocket, Martian potential... </seg>
<seg id="2484"> It conceals and reveals, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, particularly with his characters Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> No wonder he had a mask in the hand in the photograph of the campaign travel, the brand Louis Vuitton, which embodies the new face. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> He will appear in one of their commercials, aired from November 10. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> A bird hoisted a platform in the North Sea was released in nature </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A bird, hoisted after he was found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in the wild. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> It has increased the water rail aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before he is back on his feet by the Scottish SPCA&apos;s rescue centre in Alloa. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> The centre&apos;s director, Colin Seddon, said: &quot;It was probably a water rail migratory wintering who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2491"> It seems that the exhausted birds have managed to find refuge on the oil platform. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> He added: &quot;He was unable to fly again, so we have been contacted for help.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2493"> The Water Rail was in good health when he was released. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV </seg>
<seg id="2495"> Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Video-on-demand service Netflix via their television in a future that does not seem so distant. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> The subsidiary of Cogeco said on Thursday that it was currently engaged in preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> &quot;This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,&quot; said president and chief executive of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Cogeco Cable is following its competitors, like Bell, even though the subsidiary Cogeco does not yet have a precise date for this new platform. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> &quot;We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,&quot; Mr. Audet said. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers do not have access currently. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The telecommunications giant Rogers already has indicated that it could give Netflix some technical details, which were not named, could be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In the United States, the popular video service, said to be in discussions with some major cable so that its service is available via their distribution platforms. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne, on October 16. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> Ottawa wants to force providers of cable and satellite TV to offer customers the option of paying a la carte services. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;It&apos;s about two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large bundles of channels, it doesn&apos;t work,&quot; Mr. Audet said. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> However, he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Council of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to valuable recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> &quot;He will have to emerge from these discussions, a new reference framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television,&quot; said the CEO of Cogeco. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The CRTC consults the public since last week and they should continue with the industry in the next spring. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> The results, Cogeco said to have recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents per share. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is a decrease compared to net income of $44.9 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> The company established in Montreal due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Cable Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, to 1.36 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought PEER 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet service provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Cogeco revenues, they have grown by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was $43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Cogeco Cable&apos;s revenues, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> The company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> However, for the fiscal year 2013, the number of clients of Cogeco Cable is up ns5546.. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Mr. Audet is not concerned to see the number of clients fluctuate so. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> For me, it is not an indication of a change of trend, he observed. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> It varies from one quarter to another with a fierce competition. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Alexei Miller, Gazprom said that the gas pipeline from Bulgaria heralds a new era of gas </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline to Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the biggest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;A historic event occurred today: construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the large-scale project, the largest in Europe,&quot; said Alexei Miller, Gazprom&apos;s chief executive, in a statement on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> This project is a key element of the energy security of the European continent as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> South Stream is expected to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, which handles the bulk of Russian gas to Europe, increases the risk level compared to the conventional routes, &quot;says the director. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Miller added that the direct Junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed &quot;forever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2531"> The Bulgarian Consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project will be put into service in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Unknown assailants fired on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Unknown hooded men opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without any casualties, a result of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, the Police General Abdel Latif. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> This attack comes as Egypt gets almost no tourists since the army deposed the Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in early July and the law in demonstrations by his supporters. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="2539"> In English literature courses, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction since 1914. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> The review will also present &quot;new legislation&quot; to encourage a more diverse. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> A combination of literature and English language courses will be deleted. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> From 2015, pupils will have to pass a GCSE language independent, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The Ministry of Education must publish tomorrow its new English and math - the first to undergo a radical overhaul. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> There will be changes in other core subjects next year. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Moreover, Ofqual, the regulator of examinations, will unveil an overhaul of the structure of the GCSE, with a new scoring system and fewer courses. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Education minister, said that there was a &quot;broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting that the GCSE would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or three hours per week during the school year) than most other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore are about 138. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Although there is no formal obligation to spend more time on math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that GCSE maths EISR - as well as the greater importance attached to the contents contained in the international rankings-likely to encourage schools to provide more hours of courses. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> The program will focus more on &quot;The Real World,&quot; including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The European elite is ready to do business with Britain? </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of companies together and define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> To do so, we commissioned the survey the broadest and most complete with British business leaders and asked them what they thought of the Great Britain, companies and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> Yougov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors, and regions of Britain. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> We found that the vast majority of companies now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries to modernize and grow while the Member States of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> They want the Government to give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and arduous process of arcane European institutional reform. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When asked their opinion on specific policies, ranging from the regulation of monopolies, the laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to the hands of Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> The single market has caused a general dissatisfaction, saying that the cost of regulation Brussels is disproportionate to the advantages of being part of the European trading area - 40% of big business, traditionally the most pro-european, are even agree. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Finally, and more telling, our survey of business leaders found that a substantial majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favour of a change of the treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> This conclusion, which is found in all the major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a &quot;significant change&quot; that restores power to the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The stakes are high - to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would see a shift of 16% of the votes in favor of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain&apos;s membership of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> It is possible, and necessary, to better represent the interests of British business, since the eurozone is committed towards a closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our investigation show, for businesses this means new focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Beijing is a Turkmen Islamic Movement </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, based in Central and West Asia,&quot; said the boss of Chinese security organs to a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted online on Thursday evening on a website. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> It is the first time that a Chinese official refers to a particular organization after Monday&apos;s attack. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> According to the Chinese police, three Uighur men from the same family of the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, which borders several Central Asian countries, have hastened their car with gas cans against the entry of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and wounded 40. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> The driver of the car, his wife and her mother died in the fire at the car. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The ETIM, which says it is fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among the organisations affiliated to al-qaeda. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but his real influence is questioned by several experts. </seg>

<seg id="2578"> Firefighters rappelling down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save it from certain death </seg>
<seg id="2579"> A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve it safe while he was perched on 15 metres above the ground on the unstable protruding from a cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Ruby, a cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days before being rescued in a career on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, went to the career of flappit to Denholme, in West Yorkshire, to locate Ruby and thanked the Fire Department and rescue of West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> They had searched desperately for their lost dog and launched an appeal on the social networking sites after she disappeared in the career following a minor accident. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person at the sharper view walking his dog spotted ruby on a ledge in the career, stuck on 15 metres above the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> A rescue team of the Fire Hall is a cosy scramble for places and dropped in to save Ruby using a stretcher for animals to move up to the top of the cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> The technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: &quot;She was in a precarious situation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2586"> She was in the middle of the cliff, 15 metres from the summit and 15 metres above the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> It has absolutely not changed during the rescue - she was frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> But she is fine now. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> She ate cookies after. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> It was a very unusual appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> It is incredible that someone noticed the dog. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> The technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby was very lucky to get out alive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2593"> She could have been seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Ruby was taken to the vet for a control, his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Ms. Hall, of Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: &quot;I was terrified by observing the relief.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I did not initially thought she was up there. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It was surprising to have new in the arm. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had collapsed, it would probably be dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The firefighters were amazing. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> What they did was really courageous. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> They were so grateful, each of them was absolutely fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> Mr. Alderson, Keighley, added: &quot;We were afraid that she fell, but she has not moved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2603"> The firefighters were super. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> I can&apos;t believe that she was there. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy </seg>
<seg id="2606"> The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s on Friday lowered the credit rating of Ukraine, putting in doubt the capacity of the former Soviet Union, in recession for over a year, to meet its financial obligations. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The public debt of the country is at &quot;B -,&quot; spinning into the speculative investment category. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> It is accompanied by a negative outlook, S&amp;P sees at least one chance in three that it be lowered again within a year. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;It is becoming less likely that the government&apos;s strategy to ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its large external financing needs,&quot; explains the American agency. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The Agency notes that Ukraine&apos;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue. </seg>

<seg id="2631"> Pawning jewelry is not just a quick way to get cash - $1,300 for Singapore in the case of Ms amirthalinga-but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> In general, the pawn of Singapore collect an annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center. </seg>

<seg id="2659"> He was sentenced to a prison term of three years by the Court of Assize of Liverpool </seg>
<seg id="2660"> A defense lawyer, who had advised a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough of investigations into his activities connected with drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The lawyer, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and considered by criminals as &quot;a matter of primary importance,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following the police bugging operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Police officers spotted sarborough, 32, of three bags of cocaine in the home of the lawyer in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The investigation revealed that Ditta was a &quot;regular customer&quot; of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the Scarborough as well as one of his associates. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The four suspects were being monitored at the time by the police in connection with a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Cumbria, Lancashire, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for a ¬£ 1.5 m, as well as more than 200,000 pounds in cash during a series of raids. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is revealed. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Today, the Court of Assizes of Liverpool, Ditta, who works at the law firm of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, fell into disfavor after he was found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The Fall of the Lawyer came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of Ditta and placing of the pure drug, 60%, in the dustbin of the lawyer in a black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Shortly after the tabling, Scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with Ditta which was at a dinner at the football stadium of the Ewood Park club, Blackburn Rovers. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The lawyer returned home, found the drugs and they are telephoned nine times. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The court heard that Ditta was a &quot;regular&quot; consumers of cocaine after tests showed traces of the drug in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Ditta was arrested later, but denied using cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot;legal privilege.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2677"> During his arrest, Ditta picked his portfolio and attempted to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and collected a sample of hair. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> In an interview, he said he had an office in his home to his workplace and that customers call him home for legal issues. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented after arrests key to tell them what investigators were aware. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> The Public Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;If someone needs to know that it does not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Mr Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and too involved with individual clients. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The relationship that we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to her own lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Some of its communications will undoubtedly be of legitimate communications because it was her lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> But it went far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> He interfered with the investigation of the police as much as it could to enable him to continue his criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Mr Ditta did not honour to her profession, but the mud. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> He is too close to some customers, in particular, Scarborough, and he left. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Ditta has denied any wrongdoing and said: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2689"> But after the hearing, the superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta from criminal lawyer to itself when it began to buy drugs from criminal organizations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2690"> His addiction to cocaine was never compromised and left it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of leaders of organized criminal groups to obtain valuable information about police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The lawyers should observe the rules of the most stringent integrity and establish a climate of confidence among the public. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The unit responsible for the serious and organised crime in the Lancashire conducted the survey on Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstructing justice, reflecting its commitment to bring criminals to justice. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> This case should serve as a warning to criminals that they know that no one is above the law. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> We will find you and bring you to the courts. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Scarborough was himself jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Thirty-five other people involved in the smuggling were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> On its website, Ditta organized a meeting of questions and answers about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, its last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate it to work. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> A difficult year for pharmacists </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Center of Health and Social Services (CSSS) Laval caused quite a stir in the management of the Hospital of the Cit√©-de-la-sant√© and that, during the year 2012-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Because of retirements, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department found deficit sharply. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Missing nearly 30% of the staffing requirements, making this fiscal year &quot;very difficult,&quot; according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> However, the CSSS decided not to hire independent labour, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> They didn&apos;t use the troubleshooting, explained Dr. Beaudet. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the institution to remedy, the time that things would sort themselves out. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> Of course, it was hard to get our young [ residents ] to come and stay here. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> There is a set of circumstances that we were in a bad situation last year. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> Situation improved </seg>
<seg id="2728"> After this period, the year 2013 will be much easier for the department of pharmacy of CSSH.. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists were hired in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> In addition, the Department&apos;s efforts to retain have borne fruit, because the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Things are much better now, stressed the pharmacist. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> This will fill our departures last year. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Ever-increasing needs </seg>
<seg id="2735"> However, the situation remains delicate. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in the hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 are hard to predict. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> For us [ strength ] is still precarious, because there is an environment that is young and employs many young women with pregnancies, almost always stretches to three maternity leave when things are going well, she added. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Last year, there were many more, and pharmacists are not available to make replacements, so it was more difficult. </seg>

<seg id="2751"> Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be executed by firing squad. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Patek, who spent nearly 10 years at large as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> He could be released after 15 years on parole. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and left many injured. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> He was also convicted of numerous other counts in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000. </seg>

<seg id="2758"> On the verge of tears, she said that Patek have been sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> I really think that he ought to follow the same path as other men. </seg>

<seg id="2765"> Mr. Hugues said Patek ought to suffer the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage-Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed there. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Kept alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Spend 20 years in prison after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds of others, it is not much. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former Al-qaeda Leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to re-establish links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-qaida. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;He has not delivered,&quot; added Ms corteen.. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> Until recently, he cared less about the grief he had caused to others. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> &quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; said Ms corteen.. </seg>

<seg id="2800"> But it is to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency service. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> &quot;Things are gradually,&quot; said Nicolas P√©ju, spokesman of the LRA, who, on 4 November, &quot;there will be no change in terms of service.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2802"> &quot;The minister lied to us or lied to him,&quot; the doctor Gerald Kierzek. </seg>

<seg id="2861"> Pope Francis will appoint its first cardinal in February </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, the Vatican announced on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The Cardinals are the men of the church at the highest levels in the Catholic Church, the Pope and the people who elect, Fran√ßois will appoint its first group of men who ultimately will choose his successor. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> There are now 201 cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> However, as soon as a cardinal at the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope -- it belongs to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2866"> In a statement announcing the new, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which the bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate its decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the Cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably be declined. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> He said that a pope named cardinals in general as much as necessary to ensure that the number of Cardinal electors reaches 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age he wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the moment, there is a tendency to focus on Europe and Italy in particular. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals of the rest of the world in order to restore the balance,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> 40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The Cardinals will also be the first to be selected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to discuss ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Earlier, the pope decide alone. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;Now, Fran√ßois chose these eight cardinals to help,&quot; said Valero. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> He added that it was &quot;entirely possible&quot; that Francis to the Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> But we have never experienced such a situation-it is totally new. </seg>
