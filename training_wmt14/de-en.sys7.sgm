<seg id="123"> Almost every Friday he squeeze and up to 30 people in minibus and take the tied medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain in the villages who need help. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Not always everything goes smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="125"> More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud. </seg>
<seg id="126"> But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is happy at this joyous celebration. </seg>
<seg id="128"> The next morning the team begins with the analysis of hundreds of patient. </seg>
<seg id="129"> &quot;Per trip we treat 500 people,&quot; said Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="130"> They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Others receive crutches donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply can not afford. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Evenings, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="135"> The operations normally find in a school, town hall or an apartment instead, after the procedure the patient get up and go into the recovery area to make room for the next one. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so work Bwelle and his volunteers into the early morning hours on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="137"> It is a tough task, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated. </seg>
<seg id="138"> &quot;You drums all night to keep us awake and able to continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="139"> On Sunday, the team then travels back to the city, tired but proud of the work done. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has in recent years carried out 700 free surgeries and knows that she whose work has an enormous difference for the people they help. </seg>

<seg id="143"> In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaounde. </seg>
<seg id="144"> With this second job he Financiers 60% of its charitable activities, as Bwelle, the rest come from private donations. </seg>
<seg id="145"> &quot;I really do not know when he sleeps,&quot; says Katie O&apos;Malley, who is studying medicine in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and voluntarily cooperates in Bwelles group. </seg>
<seg id="146"> He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so he can go to these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="147"> For medical and nursing students as O&apos;Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience, they would never get at home. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;We can be there, where we help to dab blood or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle keep in operations,&quot; said O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="149"> That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally even and often bring donated medical supplies with. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Are they but once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will cover accommodation, transport and guide. </seg>
<seg id="152"> &quot;He is without a doubt a hero,&quot; says O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="153"> He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries. </seg>
<seg id="154"> For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden. </seg>
<seg id="155"> To help others to a happier life and to fulfill a promise he made ​​to his father, gives him great pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="156"> &quot;I&apos;m so happy when I&apos;m doing this work,&quot; says Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="157"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="158"> I hope he sees what I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="159"> I do it to make people laugh again, to relieve the pain. </seg>

<seg id="161"> Pope Francis appointed in February first Cardinals </seg>
<seg id="162"> Pope Francis going on 22 February first new cardinals of the Catholic Church appointed as the Vatican announced on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Cardinals are the highest-ranking cleric in the Catholic Church after the Pope and it is they who choose a pope, so Francis is therefore appoint the first group of men who will participate eventually in the choice of his successor. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Currently, there are 201 Cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="165"> However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years will not participate in the election of a pope - the fall of a group of 120 &quot;Cardinal electors&quot; to. </seg>
<seg id="166"> In a statement, in which the news was announced, said Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony on the appointment of the new cardinals will be held, which is also known as a consistory. </seg>
<seg id="167"> &quot;Pope Francis has decided to give its decision on the convening of the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, can be planned,&quot; Lombardi said. </seg>
<seg id="168"> Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal electors would be ready by February likely declined. </seg>
<seg id="169"> He explained that a pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinal electors again amounts to 120, and so many cardinals over 80 as he wants. </seg>
<seg id="170"> The consistory next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, so Valero. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Currently, there is a certain amount of overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy. </seg>
<seg id="172"> &quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from around the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the company founded by St. Francis Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the job to find ways to reform the church. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In the past, the Pope decided everything alone. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said. </seg>
<seg id="177"> He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis the Cardinals for advice please. </seg>
<seg id="178"> But so far we have not been in this situation - that&apos;s all brand new. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Valero said that typically the bishops were appointed from great places to Cardinals, but put Francis&apos; full of surprises - so we do not know who he appoints. &quot; </seg>

<seg id="185"> Is Europe&apos;s elite willing to make with the UK shops? </seg>
<seg id="186"> Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care in the UK for wealth and job, want to change our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="187"> To this end, we have given under British business leaders in order and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU&apos;s largest and most comprehensive survey. </seg>
<seg id="188"> YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders that represent the British company sizes, sectors and regions about. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The results of the survey will surprise many. </seg>
<seg id="190"> We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and grow, while the Member States are languishing in the EU. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You want that from the government new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, rather than on a long and tiring process to reform the obscure EU institutions. </seg>
<seg id="192"> When asked about her view on specific statutory issues - from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believed that the control of these key competences should be sent back to Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="193"> There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to a statement the company the cost of the rules from Brussels would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe&apos;s trade area - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the to which are traditionally the most Europhile. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Finally, and most will probably say, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wishes of the UK a course in the direction of change of the Agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics. </seg>
<seg id="195"> This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is on a &quot;meaningful change&quot; urges that brings the issue of action back to the UK. </seg>
<seg id="196"> The stakes are high - an amendment to the Agreement, and better conditions for the UK would result in 16 percent to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="197"> The Prime Minister should have no doubt about it: This survey shows that the UK economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="198"> It also shows that firms expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK from a retrial. </seg>
<seg id="199"> A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now moving towards closer economic and fiscal union. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to business regulations. </seg>

<seg id="458"> The government is thinking in the context of advanced actions through a &quot;test of authenticity&quot; for foreign workers with 457 visa. </seg>
<seg id="459"> Should the test be introduced, he came across a criterion used to prevent that the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia will be used. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Today, a discussion of the government&apos;s proposal was published after the former deputy of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the Government in regard to foreign workers because they could be perceived by the neighbors of Australia as an insult. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;Loud explanations like, foreigners should get in line behind &apos;and&apos; Set first Australians&apos; are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when trade unions called for a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some discernment in an echo of this historical artifact in the region, would not surprise me that. </seg>
<seg id="463"> The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once planned by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Immigration Minister Brendan O&apos;Connor, who was to discuss human trafficking in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="465"> If the &quot;criterion of authenticity&quot; is accepted, then could someone who applied for a visa to be checked as to whether &quot;the Application in the cases is real, in which the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company or person connected . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="477"> Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to focus the rays with mirrors to the valley. </seg>
<seg id="478"> This basic idea since 1913, but there was already in place. </seg>
<seg id="479"> After several years of debate, the city council finally had the 5 million crowns (approximately 615 000 EUR) adopted expensive project. </seg>

<seg id="488"> A vignette is a &quot;flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive,&quot; said the SPD negotiator on the issue of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group. </seg>
<seg id="489"> It threatened Ausweichverkehre on rural roads, which are already black spots. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would be from the perspective Pronolds also only a first step. </seg>
<seg id="491"> &quot;There is a danger that at a later date, the compensation for German is deleted,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Shrill beeping disturbs neighbors </seg>
<seg id="493"> Rhenus Midgard has invested heavily on land. </seg>
<seg id="494"> You distribute the light coming from the ships coal to the stockpile. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The company has at its several irons in the fire. </seg>
<seg id="496"> In addition to the coal import Rhenus Midgard involves inter alia on wind plant logistics. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Black shimmers coal in the storage bin in front of the dike. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Distribute Two huge blue stacker-reclaimers or load the coal here as needed. </seg>
<seg id="499"> With each movement of cargo handling equipment a high-pitched warning sound drowned out over the grounds. </seg>
<seg id="500"> &quot;The signals are used for safety and are required by law,&quot; says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven. </seg>
<seg id="501"> In unfavorable standing wind unfortunately that is to listen well - and so there have been some complaints from people in the town of Norden. </seg>
<seg id="502"> He&apos;ll take the complaints very seriously and have therefore made ​​contact with stakeholders, says the 40-year-old. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In close consultation with the authorities one is now in the process to keep the warning signs with technical measures quieter. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Also in the future, he opts for an open dialogue with the neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="505"> For Matthias Schrell has big plans at the site. </seg>
<seg id="506"> With the expansion of Lower Bridge Rhenus Midgard is continuing to import coal for power plants and is one of the greats in this sector in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Thanks to the depth to 18.5 meters mooring basin in front of the terminal and Capesize bulk carriers can already be handled here. </seg>
<seg id="508"> &quot;This year we want the envelope the 3-million-tonne mark crack,&quot; said Schrell. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In addition to the Eon power plant site, the imported coal goes to power plants inland. </seg>
<seg id="510"> If then go to the network, the GDF-Suez power plant, more than 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic. </seg>

<seg id="517"> &quot;The community is happy,&quot; says Maier. </seg>
<seg id="518"> In household 100 000 euros were recognized. </seg>
<seg id="519"> It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former nursery. </seg>
<seg id="520"> The mayor is right that winter Lingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and no longer has to pay for the upkeep of the house, such as to heat, to look after the garden and to clear the sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="521"> &quot;This effort is now gone,&quot; Maier says. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Halloween 2013: In numbers </seg>
<seg id="523"> When I was little, Halloween was something magical. </seg>
<seg id="524"> My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, staying up late and dress up for the neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="525"> Today I&apos;m more become a Halloween muffle. </seg>
<seg id="526"> In the last two years I have declared not ready to distribute sweets from my apartment, and probably will not do it again this year. </seg>
<seg id="527"> But according to statistics, I&apos;m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, indicating a total of 6.9 billion U.S. dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of Retailers (NRF). </seg>
<seg id="529"> One thing which I am every Halloween but then look again, the trend values​​. </seg>
<seg id="530"> The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion U.S. dollar spent, the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="531"> This year, provocative inanimate objects all the rage. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Women no longer have cases in sexy clothes, she can now also embody tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots. </seg>
<seg id="533"> As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Space Men&apos;ll make it this year in the Instagram feeds. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to Google, are the most searched costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches. </seg>
<seg id="535"> I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition. </seg>
<seg id="536"> Last year we dressed our dogs and were, to my surprise not alone. </seg>
<seg id="537"> In fact, Americans spend $ 330 million this year for costumes of their pets, so the NRF. </seg>
<seg id="538"> These are a lot of &quot;hot dogs&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="539"> As for sweets, we are not squeamish. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Americans this year will be $ 1.9 billion to spend on it, according to The Nielsen Company. </seg>
<seg id="541"> That is about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears. </seg>
<seg id="542"> So good news for according to the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who move with the saying &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; by the district. </seg>
<seg id="543"> In fact, we will be buying more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - make no mistake about anything - eat. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The only thing we do not want to consume the sugar-sweet candy corn, yet 15 million kilograms thereof are sold around Halloween, the National Federation of the confectionery manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="545"> That&apos;s about nine billion grains of corn. </seg>
<seg id="546"> It is a mystery I could not solve. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it is haunted. </seg>
<seg id="548"> They have great names like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which by the way is in a real prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="549"> There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States achieve the $ 500 million proceeds, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you pee straight in the pants and make friends then on Facebook, where you they do not get rid of again, and then the type to which you are located is a comment leaves like &quot;cute face&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="550"> But we finally get to the pumpkins. </seg>
<seg id="551"> Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin familiar, when we were kids, and carving a jack o lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - something that we have done from an early age. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Fortunately, the &quot;Baby in Pumpkin&quot; trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with it, zurechtzuschnitzen the pumpkin and not to sit in it. </seg>
<seg id="553"> This year, Americans spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, as the U.S. Census Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="554"> The pumpkin lantern that rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms pumpkins were harvested. </seg>
<seg id="555"> If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice out of her 921-pound pumpkin. </seg>
<seg id="556"> Pimp goes to prison </seg>
<seg id="557"> Because exploitative trafficking, pimping, threats and insults and grievous bodily harm, the district court sentenced a 33-Constance year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="558"> The former Bundeswehr soldier, who was working as a bouncer after two operations in Afghanistan, as part of a plea agreement, he confessed. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Accordingly, he has women over Internet or phone contacts met in five cases, which he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Resistance he would break with violence and threats. </seg>
<seg id="561"> The revenues of the women who bought because for years partly for him, he kept a. </seg>
<seg id="562"> By confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he tied contacts of women to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="563"> Together with a colleague, who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest. </seg>
<seg id="564"> There he let them monitor part, in order to control their income. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had come next to him in an explosion killed. </seg>
<seg id="566"> After a psychiatric expert suggested serious doubts about the mental limitation, and thus to a limited criminal responsibility, the 33-year-old put a full confession. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The court had heard none of the affected women more. </seg>
<seg id="568"> As a CID official said, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking could be determined after an initial indication by phone monitoring measures. </seg>
<seg id="569"> The intercepted conversations were characterized by high aggression. </seg>
<seg id="570"> In later interviews with victims&apos; confirmed their martyrdom. </seg>
<seg id="571"> Another witness, when one of the women had discovered bruises all over, have up to now made ​​no statement. </seg>
<seg id="572"> It would involve &quot;a completely broken personality&quot;, violence and exploitation in this profession regard as normal. </seg>
<seg id="573"> The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;He had come loose from these circles and wanted to go to prison to live a normal life,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="575"> Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="576"> Against the former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a determination by the state corruption supervision is initiated. </seg>
<seg id="577"> The former NSW Minister denies having changed the rules for Maritim lease upon request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, had the covert interests in three properties on state-controlled land. </seg>
<seg id="578"> The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) has extended on Friday its investigation on whether Obeid various State Minister to the effect affects leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a café operated without an invitation after their expiry in August 2005 to extend. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Now being investigated for the accusation, Tripodi knew about Obeids concealed interest in the land after Tripodis former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole had testified accordingly on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="580"> After years of talks, which started in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease contracts. </seg>
<seg id="581"> The tenants were against it and also wanted to longer durations. </seg>
<seg id="582"> In 2009, the leases for the Company at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids annual $ 2.5 million extended without a public tender. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Tripodi, who until November 2009 was Minister of Ports of February 2006, had originally called for public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="584"> But he denied to have made ​​the changes at the request of Obeid, who had as Tripodi confirmed pushed for a reorganization of the lease of government regulations. </seg>
<seg id="585"> One of the ICAC submitted telephone transcript showed calls from the August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official, who had moved into the harbor Ministry, after having worked under Obeid in the fisheries authority. </seg>
<seg id="586"> &quot;Was that discussed in these telephone conversations theme the development of commercial leasing arrangements,&quot; asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="587"> &quot;No,&quot; Tripodi said. </seg>
<seg id="588"> I can not remember what was discussed, but it definitely was not. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="590"> NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia because of government surveillance </seg>
<seg id="591"> On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="592"> At the direction of the Federal Agency for State Protection and Counter Terrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence agency, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost of less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank is located. </seg>
<seg id="593"> According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="594"> James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, was once again in September that the United States did not use possibilities of foreign espionage, &quot;to steal the secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. firms, the latter enhancing their international competitiveness and their profit could. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="595"> But since Edward Snowden, who has become a whistleblower former employee, has started with the release of his cornucopia of U.S. surveillance secrets to European governments and business leaders are not sure if they can take the director at his word. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency, the Brazilian oil company Petrobras spying and data American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo has procured have brought the company paranoia due to government surveillance to a new high. </seg>
<seg id="597"> The final straw brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel was bugged telephone, possibly for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="598"> If the most powerful person in Europe can become a target, then certainly also managements potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent. </seg>
<seg id="600"> I think it is conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit. </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; explains Oliver Green, President of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="602"> German companies believe the U.S. is now presented an almost as great a risk as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey, which was published in July by the consultant EY. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In the documents leaked by Snowden however, there was as yet no evidence that the U.S. has passed the secrets of foreign firms in their own companies. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Politicians have expressed concern over the fact that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and they should reduce their dependence on the U.S.. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The companies in this regard are skeptical. </seg>
<seg id="606"> In the Bundestag was suggested we should build a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="607"> I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ... </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;It does not work,&quot; says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP. </seg>
<seg id="609"> If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, then you would not have let her die out 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal cars over to agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Everything except the IT industry. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Nevertheless, range and technical sophistication of anomalies detected by the Snowden revelations U.S. spy agencies companies have shocked, who had previously seen the largest espionage risk in China. </seg>
<seg id="613"> In cloud computing, a great change takes place because European business leaders now are more aware that in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction thereof stored data and are therefore potentially at risk. </seg>
<seg id="614"> According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, survey rejected after the revelations about the U.S. data mining activities with prism about ten percent of the non-resident in the United States members plans to use an American provider. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: &quot;We see a new issue of customers who did not exist a year ago - she is: Where is my data stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this right room&quot; </seg>
<seg id="616"> Many German business leaders argue that recent reports confirm just what they already knew anyway: that powerful nations want to steal their most precious secrets and this must therefore be guarded at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="617"> The fact that industrial espionage takes place, is no surprise. </seg>
<seg id="618"> That&apos;s always been that way. </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;It was for many years a subject and has not fundamentally changed by the current debate,&quot; says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The American spy us on a commercial and industrial level, so how do we do that too, because it is in the national interest to defend our company. </seg>
<seg id="621"> The management usually does not brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives attackers advantages. </seg>
<seg id="622"> In large companies employees has long been ingrained that take away one free USB sticks at a fair or in the unattended leaving behind a laptop in the hotel room was not advisable to say the least. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at carmaker Audi says that it belonged for years to the standard practice to collect before a board meeting, the phones so that they can not be used as listening devices. </seg>
<seg id="624"> The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go on trips abroad, because smartphones can potentially be compromised. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="626"> However, there is concern that small and medium businesses remain vulnerable against hacking and surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="627"> In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche. </seg>
<seg id="628"> &quot;Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to effectively protect against unauthorized access trade secrets,&quot; warns the BAT in a report. </seg>
<seg id="629"> The U.S. warns its own companies against industrial espionage by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="630"> According to the Washington Post France, Russia and Israel were ranked behind China in second place of the countries in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February who used to procure economic data of hacking. </seg>
<seg id="631"> A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage, then &quot;the French are the worst.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: &quot;The intelligence agencies know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terror, spying on its allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> When the horse show-experts homed in droves in Cardiff, to crown the Horse of the Year, was them aware that fierce competition was imminent. </seg>
<seg id="634"> But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland. </seg>

<seg id="638"> Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which are much higher than his age. </seg>
<seg id="639"> And Toffee received high marks for his appearance and his personality. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Fenton got toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and practiced every day since then with the Shetland pony. </seg>
<seg id="641"> His mother, Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and toffee are a great team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="642"> They had to compete against the entire field of participants, and have gone with gold cup and rose from the square. </seg>
<seg id="643"> It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won. </seg>

<seg id="705"> The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are associated with the bailout over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health services to ensure that the government of the state of the money can not waste it. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth would take &quot;immediate action&quot; to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations. </seg>
<seg id="707"> Funding for a period of four years was decided by government consultations with the independent MPs Andrew Wilkie Tasmania. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The government has put together an emergency rescue package that affects our view of the unique challenges that the state faces,&quot; Plibersek said today. </seg>
<seg id="709"> The 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for optional services. </seg>
<seg id="710"> By 2600 more operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for cataracts, residues should be removed. </seg>
<seg id="711"> In addition, there is money for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after hospitalizations, specialist training, provide mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;These investments correspond to the ideas of which I affected hospital staff have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,&quot; Tanya Plibersek said. </seg>
<seg id="713"> The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth can, and report monthly on where the extra money was spent. </seg>
<seg id="715"> A three-member commission will be set up and to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible. </seg>
<seg id="716"> As Wilkie said today that $ 325 million would be of little use when &quot;they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="717"> Nevertheless, he praised the government that they had responded to its request for urgent help, which he had expressed at first against the Prime Minister in early May. </seg>
<seg id="718"> &quot;I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to use of the public health system of the state of the list of concerns,&quot; Wilkie said. </seg>
<seg id="719"> According to the government of the state of these optional benefits are largely offset the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="720"> However, the health spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today&apos;s announcement was merely a &quot;patch&quot; solution. </seg>
<seg id="721"> &quot;We are, therefore, in the present situation, because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health care system,&quot; he told ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="722"> It can not be that a state government nearly half a billion dollars tears from the system and the Commonwealth put into it 300 million and then pretend to be the good news. </seg>

<seg id="733"> About 40 women attended the last women&apos;s breakfast this year in the protestant church Bisingen. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Topic of the day in the parish hall were &quot;Proverbs from the Bible&quot; and &quot;sayings from the Middle Ages.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="735"> Zita Köhler, Chairman of the Parish Board, went to breakfast in a lecture on the biblical proverbs a. </seg>

<seg id="742"> Finally, a raffle was drawn. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Prices were covered on a table and were humorous rewritten before they were handed over to the winners. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Among the visitors to the breakfast round mingled also a candidate for mayor Roman Waizenegger. </seg>
<seg id="745"> One could call him the Dostoevsky of the USA. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and short stories also have some serial. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Amazingly, the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead. </seg>
<seg id="748"> And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky with his massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist of the Russian soul to understand, to read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite a bit in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Some titles are published by Heyne Verlag, Haffmans the cassette with the 118 stories sells Zweitausendeins. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological advances, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security and faith, to be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dick had experiences of God, his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer keyboard. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain. </seg>
<seg id="753"> He suddenly realized early on that the computers are divinities. </seg>
<seg id="754"> He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human from a machine, the creator of his creature. </seg>
<seg id="755"> This is the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; problem. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Killing. </seg>
<seg id="757"> A master of science fiction. </seg>
<seg id="758"> A fantastic writer. </seg>
<seg id="759"> His stories have film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg inspired. </seg>
<seg id="760"> This story is now particularly significant. </seg>
<seg id="761"> The &quot;Minority Report&quot; is from the year 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Here, it is the principle of &quot;pre-crime&quot; developed &quot;Pre-Crime&quot;, ie what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="763"> In Dick&apos;s world, which frighteningly similar to our own, look mutants in the future - and the police to take one. </seg>
<seg id="764"> &quot;We gather individuals who have violated no law,&quot; says the head of the authority. </seg>
<seg id="765"> &quot;We&apos;ll catch us before they can commit a crime of violence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="766"> And: &quot;In our society, there are no felons, but we have a detention camp full of Pesudoverbrecher&quot;. Read time flows. </seg>
<seg id="767"> You accept that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought is put into action. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Dick&apos;s story acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSA wiretapping. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Anticipation of the attack: Understanding Obama&apos;s drone philosophy and practice. </seg>
<seg id="770"> But Dick&apos;s story is not over yet. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The police chief complained that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls the everyday - and what is left over by the state. </seg>
<seg id="772"> Then the supervisor itself is supervised and convicted of a future crime. </seg>
<seg id="773"> The system rotates through. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It&apos;s perfect, but it&apos;s lying. </seg>
<seg id="775"> It invents its own requirements. </seg>
<seg id="776"> If errors and sacrifices not only purchase, but it builds up. </seg>
<seg id="777"> The system creates the danger that it fights. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Read Philip K. Dick means to repeatedly come closer to the truth. </seg>

<seg id="792"> 2004 action was by four men, who belonged to all minorities filed, which evolved into a class action. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Proponents of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police force and influence the way how other police departments the control. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Opponents are of the view that changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime, nor would money wasted and the broader problem of police not resolved, over the past decade stand after the loss of thousands of jobs under pressure. </seg>
<seg id="795"> The judge pointed out that they did not finish the Stop-and-Frisk Practice, which was constitutional, but only the method of implementation of controls by the NYPD is reforming. </seg>

<seg id="879"> Profits at Bombardier after decline in numbers and delivery orders </seg>
<seg id="880"> The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc. said Thursday a 15 percent decrease in net income, after he was advised by a decline in aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector under pressure. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Bombardier, based in Montreal published no flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable, next September. </seg>
<seg id="882"> On the maiden flight of test aircraft and a half months ago, so far followed only three more starts, which makes it appear doubtful whether the test phase proceeds as planned. </seg>
<seg id="883"> The results fell short of forecasts, leading to a sharp fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday its rating from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the stock has limited upside potential in the next one to two quarters. </seg>
<seg id="885"> &quot;While weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were largely expected, but by the margin development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed,&quot; Doerksen said in a client letter. </seg>
<seg id="886"> We believe that Bombardier new orders for the CSeries is obtained when the test program for the aircraft progresses. </seg>
<seg id="887"> However, if in the coming months, no new orders will be announced, we expect the market against the program is more skeptical. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Bombardier hopes that the plane number of the CSeries can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="889"> The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, the public, and flew after months of delays for the first time in September. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But so far, firm orders for the CSeries 177 are moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of flight tests and see if the allegations of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new commercial jet aircraft are accurate. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies. </seg>
<seg id="892"> CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercialization of the jet. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The management assured on Thursday with analysts and the media also, the program lies in the schedule. </seg>
<seg id="894"> &quot;The test aircraft is no longer remained on the ground as expected,&quot; Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that during the life of the aircraft were ground testing and software updates have been applied. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Each manufacturer is planning differently. </seg>
<seg id="896"> We have decided to do a first flight and then to append a revision period, what we have done. </seg>
<seg id="897"> This happens throughout the entire flight program. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The second of five test aircraft was expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was said by the companies. </seg>
<seg id="899"> However, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight of the first customer a CSeries aircraft can operate. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Bombardier said it will check the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="901"> &quot;The slow progress of the flight test - even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier&apos;s internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 shifts,&quot; Doerksen said. </seg>
<seg id="902"> In the third quarter ended 30 September fell Bombardier&apos;s net profit to $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier. </seg>

<seg id="909"> &quot;In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our requirements, but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing,&quot; Beaudoin said. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Sales in the air and space division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Bombardier, the world&apos;s largest railway manufacturer, has announced that revenue has increased in this division by almost eleven per cent to 2.1 billion dollars. </seg>

<seg id="918"> Australian airline passengers must continue off tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to relax the rules for such devices. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their rules so that passengers see on their devices during critical phases of flight e-books, watch videos or play, provided they are in &quot;flight mode&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="924"> The topic is subject to provisions allowing the airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew. </seg>
<seg id="925"> Virgin has already led to the CASA talks over a useful expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that one is open to change, but this would have to be initiated by the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;We would welcome a review of the authorization of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we offer now (wireless entertainment) during the flight,&quot; said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Qantas stated that they would remain until further with the current regulations. </seg>
<seg id="928"> &quot;Our current policy stipulates that electronic devices during takeoff and landing may not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that,&quot; the company said. </seg>
<seg id="929"> The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines. </seg>
<seg id="930"> However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, of which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it exactly. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The decision affects at U.S. companies, depending on the age of the fleet varies from. </seg>
<seg id="932"> You must prove that their aircraft can tolerate interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, carry-on programs and customer training. </seg>
<seg id="933"> &quot;When an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,&quot; the FAA announced. </seg>
<seg id="934"> In rare cases, in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, while the landing switch off the device. </seg>

<seg id="972"> At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year anniversary of the Liederkranz Dunningen two services with the &quot;Deutsche Messe&quot; by Franz Schubert will frame it. </seg>
<seg id="973"> After the great success of the musical &quot;Rock My Life&quot;, the enthusiastic spectators in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz is the closing of the Jubilee enrich two services with the performance of Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert. </seg>
<seg id="974"> On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary exhibition is from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October can be heard from 10.15 clock in the service at St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The so-called German Mass with the original title &quot;songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the Mass&quot;, D 872, is a spiritual music work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was at the time when almost revolutionary. </seg>
<seg id="976"> The show is listed as part of the services, as the contracting Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass section of the Musikverein cheerfulness Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ. </seg>
<seg id="978"> Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the wagging tail of a dog stands with his mood. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Previous research had shown that happy dog with his tail wagged more to the right (from the dog&apos;s point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But now scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and to respond. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here we have tried to take this for us in other species. </seg>
<seg id="983"> He also noted that the right brain is in dogs just like in humans responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="984"> To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail wagging their species, the researchers monitored the animals, while looked at these films from other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="985"> They measured the heart rate of quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior. </seg>
<seg id="986"> Probably we will soon understand why the tail moved in the times a times in the other direction </seg>
<seg id="987"> Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have the dogs movies with dogs shown - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="988"> When the animals saw an otherwise emotionless dog moves the tail to the right (as viewed from the perspective of wagging the dog out), they remained completely relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="989"> But it was the tail inclination mainly to the left (again, from the perspective of the dog that wags), so increased their heart rate and they looked uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="990"> According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other intentionally by these movements. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not. </seg>
<seg id="992"> He said: &quot;If you have several encounters with other dogs and wag his tail in one direction is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on these experiences.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="993"> The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal. </seg>
<seg id="994"> John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether the left and right is important for dogs. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn your head to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right if there is a contented dog. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was written: &quot;Dogs tend to go on a robot dog, if its, tail &apos;wags left and not the right place to be restless - the other way around as in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="997"> According to his testimony, the differences could be because the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he said. </seg>
<seg id="999"> &quot;While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals, that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception,&quot; said Bradshaw. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> Since their behavior but leave simply record it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes, sometimes moved to the one in the other direction. </seg>

<seg id="1098"> From the British government, a study was announced, which will increase the benefits of HS2 rail project for Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> In the work by HS2 Ltd is proposed to carry on at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project &quot;will bring together the UK closer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the British government in this plan. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> After completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> In June, the government revised the estimated cost for the construction of high-speed rail line between London and the North of England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds. </seg>
<seg id="1105"> The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for another route capacity and travel time improvements for the North of England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="1106"> This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less, ultimately from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network, which brings together the UK and its cities closer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1108"> We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> But it is also about the connection between the 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2. </seg>

<seg id="1113"> Brown said: &quot;The high-speed rail link has the potential enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time provides the economic strength of Scotland an argument for fast rail links throughout the UK.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Therefore, we are delighted to be working as a partner of the British government and to investigate the options for a high-speed rail link to Scotland, the benefits for all and creates the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh adds that plans Scottish Government already. </seg>

<seg id="1117"> Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Your house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, old trees, friendly neighbors and not too much traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> In the city there are only a few minutes by public transport. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> &quot;I hope you have no fear of spiders?&quot; Asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> I&apos;ve been looking for some time for a new apartment for my husband and me. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the worry that many stairs not being able to cope with the age of the home and in the apartment, she explains. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition: since a meniscus operation the Mittfünfzigerin had to experience firsthand what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> Most recently, a book of hers has appeared on &apos;Happy to live in old age? - What type of housing is the best for me&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> &apos;Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at the age&apos;, she begins to talk. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> When she and her husband moved into the apartment on more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment surrounded by greenery. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> Today, with the middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> But she also knows that she is one of the few people to ever deal with the theme &apos;Living for the Elderly&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Most displace it as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Old are always the others, &apos;she says with a smile. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Only when the suffering is really great should you start thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> &apos;Then it may already be too late,&apos; says Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In her book, the interior designer before 17 residential models for independent living in old age. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> &apos;But what type of accommodation you choose, is always an individual decision&apos; she explains. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> T h e solution does not exist for the age. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Even those who could not afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could also be ill. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> And: &apos;Without good knowledge of the language is simplistic common in Dolce Vita,&apos; is the textbook author resettlement willing to consider. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> In their models, there are classical models of care, alternative living arrangements or the often quoted Retiree WG. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> At the age of each has their ticks and quirks </seg>
<seg id="1141"> &apos;For me, as a residential community would be nothing,&apos; she says with a wink. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Certainly not., As in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen </seg>
<seg id="1143"> &apos;At the age you just need his retreats&apos;, as Ries. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> That a senior living community can still work, do not want to exclude the author yet. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> This must then have been different but as in the classical student apartment. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> And sometimes you just want to even his rest &apos;, she believes. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> With this view she is not alone, at least in the state capital. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> &apos;Most of the old people in Stuttgart want as long as possible remain in their own home&apos;, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civil service life in old age the state capital. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Your department advises people around the theme &apos;Getting Older&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Therefore, especially older people would often take inconveniences and restrictions in buying, just to stay in their familiar surroundings to be able to, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> There are now many ways to make the house or apartment accessible. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Ries recommends that all who deal with the age-appropriate remodeling their house or apartment, first of all to inform themselves thoroughly and not to instruct the first best craftsmen. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Today, there are specialists for the age-based reconstruction. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Even in the apartment to let one or other implement, and if it&apos;s just the toilet seat, clears the interior designer on. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> But it is not always possible to the existing dwelling age appropriate and thus remodel accessible, even if it is still so beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> This experience had Waltraud Ries make. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> Although you could install a stair lift inside the home, which also paved the way with stairs up to the apartment door but that would be far greater obstacle. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It will continue to search until they found the ideal property for herself and her husband. </seg>

<seg id="1185"> Cocaine addict lawyer who drug lord before the police investigation warned, go to jail </seg>
<seg id="1186"> Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough on </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light </seg>
<seg id="1188"> He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison </seg>
<seg id="1189"> A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug lord in front of a large police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, was sentenced to three years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> Basharat Ditta, 42, took care of the underworld size Neil Scarborough containing sensitive information about investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The by criminologists as &quot;first class&quot; touted lawyer nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; 2011 was arrested at his home after police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug method. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, handed in while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The investigation revealed that, Ditta regular Class A drugs consumed after traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards were found in tests. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Over a period of eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Together with 32 other people were later arrested after police ensured in a number of house searches heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200,000 in cash. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction would become public. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Today Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week process in two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier survey. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> The lawyer was convicted after police found out against Scarborough in their investigation that he had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and there the drug with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove put under the dustbin of the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers Ewood Park. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine notifications were exchanged between the two. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> Was announced in court that Ditta was a &quot;regular customer&quot; of cocaine, after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and to his credit in tests. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, claiming that their discussion is subject to the &quot;attorney-client privilege.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1206"> During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was a hair sample taken. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> When police interrogation, he stated that he operate both under his home address as well as the workplace an office and clients would call him at home because of legal matters. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> Was announced in court that he had called major players in the drug trade, of which he had previously represented by some significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about it. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you&apos;re not breaking the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Ditta is accused of abusing its position as a trial lawyer, he has become very involved with certain clients. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The relation in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the attorney of such persons. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> He was the police investigation as far as possible meet, so that they could continue their criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> He stood too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he admitted it, that its independence has been compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> Ditta had any wrongdoing by himself, claiming: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1218"> But after the hearing, said Superintendent Lee Halstead by police in Lancashire: &quot;Mr. Ditta has the step of a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal at the moment did when he began to acquire drugs by organized criminals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1219"> His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives leading members of organized crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> Attorneys must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public trust and confidence. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> We find you and take you to court. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had explained the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Thirty-five more beteiligte&apos;Personen in drug trafficking were sentenced to cumulative sentences of 153 years for drug offenses. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> On his website Ditta published a range of questions and answers about yourself, in which he stated his dream job was to represent as an attorney client on death row in America, his ultimate dinner guest was Muhammad Ali and inequality was the motivation for his working. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> To date, the police station Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The officers were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against building facades. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The house owners realized this in time and the eggs remains the same remote, is also likely to be incurred no damage. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> Furthermore, in the urban area and some New Year&apos;s Eve firecrackers were probably fired, but again no damage has occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-way reported that his car wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel covers were stolen. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> Until the arrival of the police, the man has his wheel covers, however, all found again in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take further action. </seg>

<seg id="1244"> &quot;New sangesfreudige voices always are welcome,&quot; said Schlotmann. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Council takes trackage targeted </seg>
<seg id="1246"> If the level crossing be &quot;at the Hirschen&quot; comprehensively renovated to improve road safety? </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Yes, the councilors have decided. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> Schiltach must for take in hand 220 000 EUR. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The German railway intends next year to improve the Kinzig Valley railway line. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Particular emphasis has been improving security at railway crossings - regularly occur nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> If the communities rebuilding measures, they must participate with one third of the costs, share the rest rail and bottom hem. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Schiltach city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the special features of Bahübergangs &quot;at the Hirschen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> But then there is the city, west to build the level of the local tunnel entrance of the train tracks a bulge. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> There are also larger vehicles, for example, those long timber could carry, stand in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Grießhaber therefore suggested a retaining wall required to construct such a way that the city could widen due course the subsequent road to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> This has been hotly debated in the council, as some councils the need for road circulation in doubt attracted Thomas Kipp brought his statement the mood of the critics to the point: &quot;Do we have to take as much money because so few vehicles in the hand&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1257"> Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railroad crossing &quot;deer&quot; was being used regularly for long timber transports. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> Even wood from the &quot;Kuhbach&quot; will partially transported via this route, because up to 20 meter long vehicles could not use the track at the Haeberle bridge because they could not then turn into the main road. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In addition, the route serves as Umleitungfür those vehicles that can not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Since it was anticipated that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and restored, as is currently the case in Wolfach, could play an important traffic importance also for a longer period the railroad crossing &quot;on&quot; deer &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> The councils agreed to be examined, which costs would cause the angedachte widening of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Notwithstanding this was the reconstruction of the railway crossing majority agreed with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built so that the city&apos;s subsequent direction of &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot; could, where appropriate, expand for oncoming traffic to around 5.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The reconstruction of the railroad crossing at the tannery Trautwein could, however, draw a very different problem by itself, which affects the access to the rapidly rising &quot;Geroltzhäuser way.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The administration had let examine the reconstruction plans of the railway by the engineering firm Breinlinger because they had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path is still easily possible. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not inconceivable that the slope ratios of the road could lead to longer vehicles sit. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> The responsibility for this, in turn, carry the city as road construction wearer. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> The conversion is therefore likely to attract liability disputes by themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Since both timber removal and the turn in the current state of development worked, one should not agree to the restructuring of the railway crossing, argued Haas. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Also, at this point the risk of collision of the train with a subject on the transfer vehicle significantly lower than at the other crossings, because right next to the breakpoint center located, to which there is a good line of sight. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Even trains from Central Station forth would have to be slowed down at this point already so far that no collision threatens. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The majority of the reconstruction of this railway crossing has been denied approval, as the town of Schiltach, &quot;would have to pay for&quot; the problem with ride-on vehicles, the councils, as the train could withdraw from responsibility after completion of construction. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> As unproblematic, the Panel considers the modifications of the level crossings &quot;Before Heubach&quot; and &quot;Before Kuhbach&quot; were made for the already crossing agreements with the railway. </seg>

<seg id="1432"> He said NotW use three methods to investigative researching stories: Phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The publisher is personally involved in the third method. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Obviously he knows from the second, monitoring, otherwise it can not be. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> What about the first? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> Does he know about the phone-hacking decision? </seg>
<seg id="1437"> He argues that from, but we say. &quot;And if he knew about it&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Rumors of an affair Clarkes were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, were told as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby: &quot;Do not waste your time, it is with Charles together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A band with voice mail on your phone at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 Mulcaires apartment. </seg>

<seg id="1448"> Early puberty: Getting faster grow </seg>
<seg id="1449"> African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white peers, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Physical changes mean not just puberty </seg>
<seg id="1451"> There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Experts believe the epidemic obesity is a trigger early puberty </seg>
<seg id="1453"> The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children&apos;s health and family issues. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Should a parent be concerned when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years, breasts and pubic hair grow? </seg>
<seg id="1456"> At the annual conference of the Children&apos;s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, said the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes are relatively common among American girls and a new norm represented. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> &quot;I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents - usually this is not a sign that puberty occurs quickly now,&quot; said Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor to show up earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> Nevertheless, it is only a slight shift in the age of menarche was (onset of menstruation) in the last 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> In the United States the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> &quot;If the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to menarche,&quot; Kaplowitz said, also author of the book &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide for handling this frequent problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Time is the most accurate test, as puberty progresses. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> It is unclear in what actually constitutes the onset of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious&quot; when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> In most cases, the process is slowed or stagnated - something that can accurately monitor a pediatrician. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> For faster progress tests might be indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> There are treatments for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small stature in adults. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Kaplowitz is cautious when it comes to drugs, but he admits: &quot;. Suppressing puberty can conduct problems and alleviate the feelings of girls to be different than their peers&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1470"> The other major problem is understandable: parents just do not want their very young daughters have the period. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> &quot;They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; said a woman whose daughter has received with its ten days reminder. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> She was scared and excited by the school to go home because she was the first in her circle of friends. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> However, there are currently no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would cause. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Boys like girls come earlier puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and the onset of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white peers. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> There are different explanations for this. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Global seems to be an early puberty of all sorts of things to be affected by economic conditions over the air to the genes. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Another mystery: Although boys facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend toward a full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and young children. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> &quot;We must be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children&apos;s Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician, as they should speak with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;This may mean that you have to run earlier than expected a conversation,&quot; advised Kaplowitz. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> If you stay calm, the child usually responds well. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Girls who blossom early, need the insurance, this is the process a normal part of life, even if it is sooner than expected. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants </seg>
<seg id="1493"> With beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to cope with the round course on the hills around the lake. </seg>

<seg id="1501"> In second and third place came Anne needle from Illmensee and Leonie driver Owingen. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> A positive development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Apply not only to the performance, the whole range was represented on athletes. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> The age structure ranged from ten years in the youngest to 70 years for the oldest starters. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> In the main race even more absolute top athletes this year were at the start. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Four drivers were allowed to settle by the regional leaders. </seg>

<seg id="1519"> Israeli fighter planes had attacked Thursday night a goal in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a senior government employee against Fox News. </seg>

<seg id="1522"> Israel has at least twice been carried out air strikes on missile deliveries to Syria this year. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Before the derby against Schalke mitgereiste BVB supporters had taken care of with flares for ugly scenes at the Veltins-Arena. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced to severe consequences. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Before Friday&apos;s game in the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart Ultras responded with a silence - at first. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which the viewer to park offered shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> To hear the guests were mostly fans with their songs. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The South Stand, however, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are first presented itself exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> The pedestal of the Capo, who usually coordinates the common accentuation remained unoccupied. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> And the very front in the stands blew lonely a big flag with inscription &quot;section stadium ban&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Just as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always became the first BVB players the place, surged on short-term jubilation. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and waving scarves - but not universally. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand nothing stirred. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> The fact that the stadium announcer Norbert Dickel again the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract renewal of coach Jürgen Klopp - enumerated, did not care for celebratory mood. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> It was not until five minutes before the kickoff of crested Capo his podium - and the hitherto almost tangible with hands tension erupted into a loud cry, as Dickel as usual queried the atmosphere in the stands at the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> The last was, as always, the South Stand on the series - and was finally here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> And as with the latest kick-off of the south stand the loud call &quot;Derby winner will be on&quot; came, everything was as usual again. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> Immediately before derby against FC Schalke 04 some of the terraces BVB fans flares were fired into the stands and on the court - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The game was later kicked off because of the chaotic scenes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received in his office the tops of Dortmund Ultras then - and is believed Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable for the fan representatives appointment. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> &quot;There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra movement,&quot; the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> As an immediate measure under Watzke said the ultras a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> &quot;I have forbidden,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> The zero tolerance policy when it comes to pyrotechnics, we can not give up. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> In addition, the Ultras different ways of punishment were demonstrated - until Tuesday they have now time to choose one. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Otherwise, Watzke, BVB will determine a sanction until the end of next week. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> &quot;This is drastic,&quot; assured Watzke. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> It will be interesting how the responses to the South Stand fail then. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> What happens on the go with my e-mail? </seg>
<seg id="1551"> E-mail is, actually electronic letter. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Was similarly implemented in the design of the Internet e-mail service as in the conventional postal technically the secrecy? </seg>
<seg id="1553"> In the design of the early Internet services was at the forefront to make communication possible. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Therefore, we did not pay for the basic technical protocols on creating a stable foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> If Licensees &quot;Anna&quot; send an email to &quot;Benni&quot;, the computers of the two are then connected directly? </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends in the first step the mail to the mail server of your service provider. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> If she has, for example, a GMail account, that would be Google. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> This mail server sends the content to the provider, the Benni uses. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> On the route, the mail run on some other server on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Bennie can then call from his provider of the content. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> If conventional emails read along on their way through the net? </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Most emails are on the go read several times by software robots. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> The provider of the sender is checked in the rule, whether the mail leads a malicious program as an attachment with it. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> A virus check is also done on the receiver systems. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Also, check the provider whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least wegsortiert in a spam folder. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Did the robots still another object? </seg>
<seg id="1568"> In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needed to place contextual advertising. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their upcoming holiday travel, Google may display appropriate links to holiday offers. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Read and unknown people with e-mails? </seg>
<seg id="1571"> The likelihood that unauthorized people read along an e-mail, is extremely low. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Theoretically, this is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> In companies often administrators have the option to read along electronic mail. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> The law enforcement and intelligence agencies have legal ways to intercept e-mails or to take note of. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> There are also possible illegal Ausspäh actions. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Is it possible to protect e-mail messages against eavesdropping? </seg>
<seg id="1577"> With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail will be encrypted effectively against eavesdropping. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> With high technical complexity, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that may not even be readily recognized, who communicates with whom. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The mailboxes mainly privately used Yahoo and Google play according to a survey of Convios Consulting in August 2013 only a subordinate role. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> While the shares of Yahoo Mail were last fallen, GMail Google could increase significantly. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Germany&apos;s largest regional church has started a campaign to promote the profession of the pastor. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> Background is a potential priest shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will halve According to our current location in 2030. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> With Burfien the national church for the first time appointed a pastor on a full-time job to inspire young people to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Currently, young people choose less and less after high school to study theology. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Burfien attributes this to the process of secularisation back: &quot;God&apos;s voice is low, the world is loud.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Here, the profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> I am the master of my schedule and can there my priorities set, where it is important to me. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Pastors could be as a pastor very close to the people. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> They earned so much as a teacher and could live well. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Certainly get paid more in the private sector, but theologians have a safe employer. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> The&apos;ll meet the young people of today, where there was not only a career, but a meaning to what we work. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> According to the National Church, which comprises three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently per year are around 60 pastors to retire. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At the same time begin about 40 graduates of theological studies her Vicariate. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or Wendland future it could be hard to fill positions. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Burfien plans to organize among other study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> The study of theology offer a broad education. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> One can thus even be President. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Two charged with YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenses: hearing before the Royal Commission </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Two YMCA Leaders of New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offenses relating to children before 2011 allegations against the nannies Jonathan Lord were collected from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission learned of sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> But at the opening statement to the Commission of the YMCA had declared that they had &quot;never had to do in the organization with an incident of child sexual abuse&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of misdemeanor child pornography, and another was convicted at which a physical education instructor of Caringbah YMCA Hall in 1991 for the abuse of entrusted him children. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Hare said Gail Furness, a Commission assistive lawyer that he was aware of the first case, the second but have not known. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He conceded the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission should also have been inaccurate in the assertion that &quot;there had been external audits of the YMCA, where the YMCA was recognized as at the forefront of child safety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Evidence before the Commission to show rather that the YMCA was informed that he has received the second-lowest rating of the four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged that management had failed &quot;from me on down&quot; in the setting of Lord and failed to ensure that staff had been out of their obligations clear to violations of the Guidelines for child safety Report. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two years with the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> He was sentenced to at least six years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem, the employee had held them to report violations Lords in relation to the safety of children. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> The employees testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that the Lord was alone with children, she worked privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, to a said that he had to love it, and let children play with his cell phone . </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Danielle Ockwell whose superior lord was and had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the children&apos;s ministry director Jacqui Barnat that the supervisor was Lords in YMCA Caringbah, &quot;very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable war &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> The manager stated that he would not accept statements from employees, which they had not dared to report to their superiors message. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Instead, he said, had rather affected her friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Hare said he had the board of the YMCA NSW communicated its view that the lesson had to be learned from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; the organization, &quot;not the answer&quot; concerns by employees, and the Board have agreed to it. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Hare said the decision to urge the employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of the allegations, had been hit by the managing director of children services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He said they were designed to prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been implemented but &quot;overzealous&quot; and bad. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 there was no safe for children&apos;s organization, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> He explained that there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in hiring, review, training, training and supervision of employees. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The hearing was to 20 December was postponed. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Tourism: descent to the Romans </seg>
<seg id="1623"> At around 120 meters in length, a sewer from the Roman period has been preserved beneath Cologne. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> If you visit Cologne, can not ignore the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> Around 157 meters the two towers in the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> But few visitors who marvel at the two filigree spiers, knowing that it is also under the cathedral to discover a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Meeting point for its tours is the service center of Cologne tourism next to the cathedral. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The tour begins at the very unspectacular: &quot;We start in the garage,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore remained of the ruins of the ancient city walls, only the stand, which was not too great. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Most users of the car park therefore now rushing past also to the Roman remains and turn off only her car. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> But if you look twice, discovered a severed by metal bars archaeological site in the parking deck D2. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> On display are about five feet high ruins of palm-sized stones. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> &quot;There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ,&quot; says Schulze. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Before it goes back to light, can Schulze participants on the upper parking level another look into a dark, 15-meter shaft throw. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> This is the well of the old cathedral, which is, unfortunately, hardly noticed. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants again descend into the depths. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> We see here the official seat of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> What does CCAA would like to know a visitor. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;The acronym stands for&quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium &quot;what good German as much as&quot; city of Roman law and the city Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the imperial cult &quot;means&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> And the judgment hall is the former governor&apos;s palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire at the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance leads to the Roman sewer that is available here at around 120 meters in length. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> &quot;You can calm a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima go along if you want,&quot; Schulze cheers for the guests. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> A surprise has Schulze yet. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> After he has brought the key to the box office, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in bay. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> &quot;We are now in a mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual ablutions. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> To date, in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing level of the Rhine. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone in the town square, for which construction is scheduled to begin shortly. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Until the completion but still will take some years. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> Land Rover Rally Series angekündigt </seg>
<seg id="1652"> In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point harnesses, and a speakerphone. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with care by bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;The rally customers who come to bowlers have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1655"> They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We are pleased to open this way, in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new ways to experience the various rally events in the UK and abroad and newcomers to the rigors and reality of Rally Raid prepare. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> We really had fun working to develop the Defender Challenge cars - this is a fun championship. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Moreover, there is at the Defender Challenge a training and test day in February as well as the option to take part in desert race in North Africa and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots a choice </seg>
<seg id="1660"> A new day, a new horror story to independence. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> This provides the cue for stories about passport checks in Berwick and secured with barbed wire border along Hadrian&apos;s Wall. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> In fact it has been on the potential economic benefits noted in the Strathclyde template that would bring more freedom to travel the rest of Europe with it, but played it - as expected - in the headlines not matter. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Also no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often rightly turn their strict rules when it is convenient for them. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> So really no story. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> And one that is already so come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I used the &quot;independence means passport control&quot; Duck heard years ago at least 40. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Here an interesting point when constantly repeating this ancient history is lost. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it dances to the European pipe? </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Why swap the yoke against the London from Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1671"> These are the real European news: The big, ducted after the war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Throughout the EU, parties gain ground, which are EU-hostile or want to have the euro as their common currency overboard. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Even in Germany was the euro-skeptic party alternative for Germany - founded only this year - nearly five million votes snag in the general election in September for themselves and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Because of the restrictions imposed by Berlin and the European Central strict austerity policy in conjunction with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is constrained by adherence to the single currency, many people believe, the European project has gone too far. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Instead, the euro system has its members nailed on exchange rates, which are advantageous for German exporters - and want German politicians like to be so. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe is with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany again. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The only way is to cut wages and public spending - inspired by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> As a result of the prescribed from Brussels &apos;green&apos; energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - pay to European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we could see in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> All wage commits the world to protect the European petrochemical industry is not about to be pushed by cheap American shale gas in the corner. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> As a result, draws up a revolt, especially in France, the EU&apos;s former cheerleader. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> After the war saw the French political elite, the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and could lift Paris on par with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But Berlin Paris needs no more than the gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy is struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election and thus the ruling Socialists referenced third place. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that they can not assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> What makes Le Pen with her newly gained popularity among the white French the working class? </seg>
<seg id="1692"> You want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-single currency bloc in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> If the anti-EU parties do well in this election - and this is very possible - then could the first time such a block, the European Parliament dominate. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> This is the point at which I&apos;m getting at: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations,&quot; the General de Gaulle favored. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro firm, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> I expect that Britain distances from this project in hopes to curry favor with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> However, suggests Washington&apos;s growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Where is Scotland in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also involves Berlin and Brussels to say what they can stick it where. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a looser European alliance, if we keep our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Otherwise, we should consider to emulate Norway and retain our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made​​) won in 2011 cuts that the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib were responsible for the coalition. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> It would be ridiculous for Scotland, now to decide for independence to get forced austerity only to Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but no cell phone conversations) </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Air travelers can hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, working, games, music and use the watching movies, but not on a call with the phone now, the new Directives on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were issued in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> However, the passengers should not expect that these changes are implemented immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta told a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> The airlines need the FAA to demonstrate that airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the arrangements for the storage of the device according to the new regulations. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The FAA stated that it had already received from some airlines plans that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> &quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could expand the use of electronic devices very soon approve,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> It may not start up if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and is the captain of the green light. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Upon entering the landing, passengers must switch it off again and may not restart them before the plane landed. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Under the new guidelines could airlines whose planes were protected against electronic interference, allow their passengers to use the equipment even when off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Most new aircraft and other airmen who were converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> &quot;If the new regime is implemented safely - and we are therefore cooperating closely with the airline -, the two sides will benefit,&quot; said Glading. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> It is we honestly sorry to feel on this issue as watchdogs. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Never-theless Internet connections for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers still prohibited, explained the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> So no still &quot;Words With Friends&quot; which Scrabble similar online game, in 2011, played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone when he had publicity leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off the power while the the aircraft was parked at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, since the possibility of injury if they fly through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Cell phone conversations during the flight also remain still prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> The regulatory authority for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> FAA lifts ban possibly for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Highway Traffic Safety Administration National Transportation Safety Board, a security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered a risk. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Mobile is really a problem, not only because it could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can interfere with transmission towers,&quot; said Rosenker. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> An advisory committee of industry, which was launched to study this topic by the FAA, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on the use. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued that there was no valid security reasons for the ban. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The restrictions are also more difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> In some studies, it is mentioned that forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device up to a third of the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports of disturbance of navigation and communication devices carried by passengers FM radios had become known at that time represented the latest technology trend. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they make electronic interference nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Airlines offer passengers for a few years Wi-Fi if the altitude has been reached. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The adapted to Wi-Fi systems flyers are also less susceptible to interference. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Today&apos;s electronic devices emit radio in general much less radiation than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> E-reader, for example, emit minimal radiation when page is turned. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> But when downloading or sending of data transmission values ​​are stronger. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among the advocates of a relaxation of the limitations of the instruments use by passengers counts Amazon.com. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> 2011 invited company employees a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made ​​a test flight, to identify problems, but could not find. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in the use of equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> Douglas Kidd from the passenger National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that failure by the device was real, even if the risk is minimal. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Other committee members said there were only scattered reports of pilots who speak for a failure of aircraft systems by the device, and most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The committee recommended that the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by the passengers during instrument landing under poor visibility conditions. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> A grouping of the travel industry welcomed the changes, described it as a reasonable accommodation for travelers who would now be extensively equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>

<seg id="1765"> Most pigs are slaughtered at six months. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Television with level? </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Even details such as the pH value of the meat play a role. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The darker the meat is, the higher the pH. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;Because I&apos;m curious if you Roberto Blanco mete, what happens then,&quot; said Jumbo cynical. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> Here the level of private television will be presented in pure culture. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> But it&apos;s still worth watching. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> The viewer sees that the disassembly of the legs is still handmade. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> After all, Black Forest ham is to find traditional boned on the shelf. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The secret of the ham is the spice mix with the salt. </seg>

<seg id="1782"> With a small squad, the men had to TSV I Freudenstadt start of the Schiller-school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although the Älbler were associated with an experienced team on the other line side. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Soon, however, showed that they also age-related, could keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter not quite. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> With the hard and placed premiums on the Gönninger did extremely difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> They repeatedly missed the clean on the network center leaked by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz passes and attacks and were not in the block defense on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly from the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Faced with this overwhelming and decisive game performance then the third set was a bit lax and lethargic for 3-0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22) won. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Since the second November communicate with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail in clear Nagold, a much more powerful opponent on the field. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannick Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> They gave off a hard-fought two-hour match. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Nervousness on both sides caused primarily when receiving a pass error and points gifts, even when the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical scenes prevented the excessive zeal of the view point of potential profits. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> In terms of performance this very balanced encounter in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed but throughout the great physical effort and a welcome commitment by both teams. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Gechingen: No absolute protection possible </seg>
<seg id="1796"> &quot;We want to involve the population at an early stage in the planning,&quot; Mayor Jens Haussler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> About 80 participants came to the church hall to be explained the measures envisaged to ask questions, voice concerns and suggest ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Haussler clarified: &quot;The final decisions make the members of the council.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1799"> The floods, the Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared met, was a decisive event was, that raised the question of safeguards for the future, said Haussler. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> A river basin study had been given with the neighboring community Aidlingen in order, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> &quot;The protection of as many of developed land is the goal,&quot; said Haussler. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Is presumed to be the planning of protection against a loud German Weather Service statistically every 100 years to the expected flood. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The climate change is supported by a 15 percent surcharge invoice. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> In professional circles, this is referred to as &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> The water masses that had led to considerable damage Gechingen 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve,&quot; said Haussler. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros to be invested in Gechingen, the community can expect to land grants in the amount of about 70 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> Haussler pointed out, however, that it only give the promotion, if an overall concept would be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> For this, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> In the best case could be in 2016 started to implement. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented already in the past week in the council sees (we reported) before local action in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Following the presentation of the flood risk management strategies, the participants took the opportunity to express their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Among other things, has been questioned, why do not more dams and retention basins are planned for the protection of the place. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Gregor Kühn, planners of the engineering firm contracted forest and hills Corbe from home, who introduced the concept, emphasized that it needed the cooperation of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Moreover, it should be held to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest by forest and Corbe. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> There was resentment among local residents of Altorts who have to suffer even in normal thunderstorms repeatedly to overloading of the sewerage network. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The problem is known in the management and first steps have already been taken. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> Haussler noted, however, that the guidelines for duct systems are other than for flood protection and this should not be mixed. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The municipality has an obligation, the sewer system be designed so that two-to three-year rain events could be coped with. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The sewers to be dimensioned larger, millions would swallow. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The redesigned Opschlag shines with a new cafe. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> One that invites you to linger and return. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> One that would make the name of the program. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> As Déjà Vu is referred to according to the dictionary a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling that you have ever experienced or seen a new situation. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> In the case of the visit of the eponymous cafes on Opschlag in the county town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine-Waal University it does not stick to the pure déjà vu feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Finally, the cafe is with the beautiful name exactly the goal: to make actual stay not only mental, but always by hand repeatedly experienced. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Because it&apos;s just fun and simply beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> A look inside the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer an instant good feeling. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience, looks like a place to relax. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> Here the team spoils with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Buettner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variations. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> In addition there is delicious cake or individually occupied fresh baguettes. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The owners, both 33 years old have made ​​a name as a restaurateur before the opening of this lovely cafes on Opschlag, In Kranenburg they brought the &quot;Art Lounge&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> From moving to Kleve on the Opschlag the sympathetic café lovers hope more audience. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Not least by the university. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> &quot;Where we have no particular target group,&quot; says Daniel Buettner. </seg>

<seg id="1843"> &quot;For this, a baguette - that&apos;s my thing,&quot; she says of the NRZ. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Two events gave it even in the bright café. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> Better said one. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Because the harbor festival became incarnate rather be outdoors - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> But there was also the Ringelnatz evening. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> &quot;Beautiful, successful and funny,&quot; found the two 33-year-olds. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> But not everyone&apos;s thing. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Maybe Daniel Buettner is therefore not a huge fan of event evenings: &quot;Man&apos;s can now times not please everyone&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> And with an event I always speak to only those who are also interested in the special event. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> That&apos;s why events are more likely to be the exception for us. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> &quot;We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> In terms of the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The road, which more and more is becoming a restaurant mile. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow indicates this month. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers will be offered during long flights in economy class - not always the ones to try on most airlines, but this designated area is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing CO. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Airbus called this week an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the American archrival Boeing says it should be decided by the airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer vying even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft for sale, and in the event of 17 to 21 November record expected orders. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> As the rear part of the aircraft is designed - especially if there are a series of nine or ten seats - is crucial for the specified economic results that will supply the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; style. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Boeing claims its modernized &quot;777x&quot; summarize 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and so allow ten per row. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> Airbus stated that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per row. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Aircraft giants often share of blows on the technical details through advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Now Airbus appeals before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777x is expected to make more than 100 orders the race, directly to the public. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Recently, the company introduced a display in front of which are the beginning of a new war could display and donors showed a picture in which three people squeezed together sit in a restaurant, and to the title: &quot;Would you accept this&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;Boeing proposes long-haul flights in sitting in front of which are narrower than regional turboprops,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> In view of changed eating habits, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, the modern long-distance travel-defined, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st Century is, according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Airbus says his rival to take hold of a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly christened &quot;Jet Set&quot; was narrower. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> You have so Airbus, conducted studies showing that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the Sleep Quality Increase by 53 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus to the seat dimensions and says it is not left to the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between fares and furnishings. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The company also declared, according to studies depended on the experience in the airplane over the seat width. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> &quot;It really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need in their view, to be successful,&quot; explained the flight cabin expert Kent Craver, Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> You do not want that we dictate to them what makes them profitable. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> They know their business better than anyone. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> For passengers, it&apos;s about more elbow room, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that may affect the sales. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Behind the dispute is a race to aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a significant impact on the export performance of the U.S. or Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> As Reuters first reported in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate on the new jets. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Both Airbus and Boeing claiming 20 percent more efficient per seat in its latest twin-engine long-range designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> The statements Boeings to the results depend in part on the fact that the 777x with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 is compared. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The increased costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;That&apos;s why Boeing squeezes more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products there,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, Director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> On the other hand, analysts say, full cabin with ten seats per row indicated at existing 777s out that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which may be associated with cheaper fares. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;Eighteen inches Seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin interior, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Airbus and Boeing are no seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can select. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The globe-trotting jet-seller even wear tape measure with you to remeasure the device during the competition. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> Even if they promote the comfort, but so have all manufacturers also use jets of highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Airbus offers an A350 with ten seater ranks, but still has not sold his own words. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Until recently Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered for some Jets wide seats in the aisles. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call will fizzle out after a new industry standard probably, but might distract from the shaft of 777x sales. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Veganism is subordinated to the vegetarianism, according to dictionaries, differs from this but in a very significant way. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Because while vegetarians eating cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam allow these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to not eating meat and fish can be from the vegans from all consumption of animal products - honey is denied. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> What remains, one might ask, but upon closer inspection, the vegan diet world characterized by a considerable ingenuity from. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> &quot;Spreads are very popular,&quot; says Ute Henkel man, the owner of the local health food store that holds a variety of special products for vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Reuben Proctor also visited the store in Domgasse like. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> For 13 years, the New Zealand-born vegan, in Lampert home he finds (almost) everything on what he needs to live. &quot;In 1997, I introduced to my diet and became a vegetarian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Around the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1904"> &quot;The conviction came not only because of the food but because of the choice of shoes,&quot; says Proctor, who prefers leatherette normal leather. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> He realized that it&apos;s also in other everyday matters without animal products. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> First and foremost, be a vegan ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> &quot;I do not need that animals die for me,&quot; Proctor says of the maxim of vegans, who covers the entire consumer behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears hinterherzutrauern, the vegans have quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> &quot;It&apos;s a double bonus,&quot; Proctor says today, &quot;actually puts his vegan any waiver, no asceticism, but also it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that reducing the variety of dining options with the change in diet, Proctor rather leads back to the force of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> And these conditionings could also fail no matter how many well-intentioned attempt. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> &quot;The addiction factor is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking,&quot; says Proctor on a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> And a used: &quot;Certain tastes are not moor at the beast.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Often it&apos;s the spices or the type of preparation that make up the flavor. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> &quot;But you can produce the same effect in other ways,&quot; says the vegans. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> At a barbecue brings Proctor example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Veganwürste. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> He shall ensure a balanced and varied diet, which is quite well once should taste savory. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Of course you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> &quot;It is supposed to taste, but this is to reduce not only on animal food,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Harmful effects to eating disorders, a more widespread acceptance that he had not suffered. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> For me, the change has had a positive aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> I take no strange cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;My blood values ​​are well, I&apos;ll often check,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 warn Vegansimus many critics. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> &quot;Because animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 content is high,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For vegans, it also give you the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets to be. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> &quot;My B12 levels are fine,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> Long distances must not go Proctor for food procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Staple food, there is finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Everything I need, I find locally. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Only now and then I buy something special. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> &quot;Many people overlook that just only the finished products are expensive, but so is the case with&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products are also known to&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> In any case, the preparation vegetarian dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than generally believed. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> &quot;In the home kitchen, there is much to discover, with a few minor tweaks can be good, if not in some cases better results,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonated instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake was able to bring his parents to marvel Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Family celebrations gives the vegans a new spice. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> This has momentum when you cook together, which has a new significance. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> &quot;The situations which may thereby arise are as varied as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> Of course skepticism but it has also been met with. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> No longer tastes good my food? </seg>
<seg id="1941"> &quot;Should I now feel bad because I drink milk?&quot; - For of these questions one must act as a vegan with tact. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> &quot;I do not reject people from yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would eke no Enklavendasein. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> And a closer look at the everyday world then did not appear so veganfremd as suspected - and the vegans not as restricted as is commonly assumed in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> Fast food is also allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> Fries are everywhere! </seg>
<seg id="1946"> &quot;Many kebab shops sell falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> In a pizzeria he will fallback to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The restaurants provide so slowly respond. </seg>
<seg id="1949"> &quot;When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan, everything was much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealanders can make a development track down: &quot;You have to talk to people, make them aware of it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1950"> &quot;If enough requests come, they may be inclined to add to the menu,&quot; he hopes. </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Vegan Restaurants evolve, such as the galley in Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Proctor who desires that other restaurants have at least stand a vegan dish on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> Basically are vegan dishes for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> Everyone can eat, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> &quot;Meat dishes, however, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> &quot;If you want to avoid food scares, then veganism is a sure way to make the most part impossible from the outset,&quot; says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> However, the shopping vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Especially when you learn to understand the animal additives contained in peanuts as colorants his can, it seems to leave quickly to compliance with the ethics of so many hurdles and pitfalls of courage. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Not only, therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: &quot;Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives&quot; explains the many ingredients that are buried food but also detergents. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> &quot;Gradually, you develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to look out for&quot; It&apos;s sometimes better to do small steps than stand still or to stumble, &quot;says Proctor. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The veganism, it is an important moral clue who beats on consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Perhaps he did not make it all that it stores its habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critical. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Bavaria&apos;s basketball team optimistic despite first defeat </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Even the first defeat in the Euro League was at the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich do not detract from the huge optimism. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> &quot;No one can forbid us to believe in it to win against the best team in Europe over the last two years,&quot; reported Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> We have sent the message: In Munich there is basketball! </seg>
<seg id="1967"> In their only third appearance in Europe&apos;s premier class, the Munich-selling long very well, were in the crucial stages but just do not clarified enough. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Guests initially managed the feat of a 15-point deficit to convert 13 minutes before the end, in a lead before Piraeus gave the game again a turn. </seg>
<seg id="1969"> &quot;We fought back incredibly against two-time Euro League champion, but then again made ​​careless mistakes,&quot; said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful bowler of Munich, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish champions Zielona Góra. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking put an end </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against a lifetime of nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Before testing in humans, further experiments are needed, which may still take some years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results look good. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination once can help millions of smokers who tried to quit and have tried doing all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; says Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker experiences nicotine high. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> In experiments retained vaccinated mice which nicotine was administered at their normal level of activity. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Mice without vaccination against it would have taken a &quot;time-out&quot; the researchers a sign declared that the nicotine had reached her brain. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The vaccinations needed to maintain the antibody level are so often given that they were expensive and impractical. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> However the cost of the new vaccine are probably much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> As Professor Crystal said, could be a future human vaccine when he was quite sure children are administered before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> More likely is that smokers would use him to quit. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> &quot;You know then: When they start to smoke again, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure here, and that helps them to take the habit,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time, it is still more research is needed. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> However, Guillaume Nicloux &apos;adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinced with exceptional production facilities and contemporary details, is also heavier food than necessary. </seg>

<seg id="1992"> When they rebelled, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic matron and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> The film never slips into lasciviousness or sensationalism - and therein lies his problem. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The solemnity with which the film is told, makes him also for the audience to tormenting hair shirt. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Egypt&apos;s first president sworn in freely chosen </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Mohammed Mursi sets from the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a &quot;new Egypt,&quot; as he was sworn in as the first elected president of the country and thus the successor of Hosni Mubarak took, which had been 16 months previously expelled from office. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and Egypt&apos;s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy, about 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> He swore the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes judges of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile, and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> &quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said the 60-year-old Mursi, a trained in the U.S. engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group since its inception was usually taken 84 years ago as a proscribed organization by the government sharply targeted. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building, as Mursi shortly after eleven clock local time, arrived in a small car convoy. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential pomp of the Mubarak-time traffic was only briefly halted so that the convoy could cross the usually busy street, with the city center connects the southern suburbs. </seg>

<seg id="2012"> However, with the drop of the official oath before the Court and not as usual in front of the Parliament he obeys the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue. </seg>

<seg id="2029"> Frontier Airlines charges fees for carry-on luggage </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 dollars of passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Frontier Airlines intends to up to 100 dollars for one piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda to calculate, even if one could read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers could keep the whole tin. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> The new fee applies to carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Frontier said, compute 25 U.S. dollars if the charge is paid in advance, and $ 100 in travelers who had paid at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&apos;Malley said that the fee of U.S. $ 100 Aim, travelers to move to take care of in advance of the payment. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> &quot;We do not want to calculate this sum,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> Airlines began in 2008 in order to charge a fee for the first and second checked bag. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> Passengers who tried to circumvent these have, therefore, as much as possible crammed into hand luggage, which has the consequence that the overhead bins are often crowded on the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Fees are one way to move passengers to be less to take on board. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> O&apos;Malley said at the new fee, it had not actually about making money. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> This is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have made ​​clear that there would always be difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> Passengers who buy tickets on the airline&apos;s website, do not pay. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> This means that a passenger must be present at the boarding gate of Frontier may take one piece of luggage free, but the next person has to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> O&apos;Malley stated that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they came to the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The new baggage fee of Frontier occurs only in the summer in force an exact date, there are not. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> Passengers complain frequently about Baggage fees and other charges, but airlines like to grab it back. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> They argue that the transport of luggage and passengers should cost money to pay for this service if they wanted him. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Most have so far, however, the finger of fees for carry-on luggage. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years before the first penalty for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, also a low cost airline. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who pursues the additional fees carefully. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit transferring 50 million U.S. dollars annually. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what to expect him at the gate when passengers would be faced with the unusual hand baggage charge of the company. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> &quot;The boarding process was one of the smoothest I&apos;ve experienced in my career in aviation,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> I expected to see gnashing of teeth and palpable discussions at the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> &quot;The plane was full,&quot; he explained, &quot;and the boarding went well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2056"> Frontier Spirit also follows for the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, soda or juice. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, could keep the whole tin and coffee is refilled for free. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Water remains free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> U.S. Airways 2008 had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but this made ​​seven months later reversed after passengers complained and no other large company had followed. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Frontiers step to charge fees for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative should be directed to the customers on your own website. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> This provides all the companies an incentive to passengers to move to the direct purchase from them instead of using an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> Frontier, however, is gone furthest in this area. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> In September, the company began to forgive when booking through an online travel agency only half the number of frequent flyer miles. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> On Wednesday, the miles were further reduced to 25 percent of the route. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Booked at a third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore a still only 250 miles. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Passengers can book on the website of Frontier courts exclusively for direct purchase. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> The proceeds declined by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as we read in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Republic has been trying to get in connection with the sale of the company&apos;s finances by Frontier under control. </seg>

<seg id="2092"> The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gym in high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family&apos;s attorney said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was born on 11 January found in an upright erected mat that stood behind the bleachers in the school gym. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> The investigating officer of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this questions the family of the 17-year-olds. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;They are convinced that their son was murdered,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer from Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> You would never have thought he was died as it had concluded the sheriff. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> &quot;They are of the view that it was devoid of any logic, against the laws of physics as well as against the common sense contrary,&quot; said Crump. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Rather, they were convinced that the truth may be covered up to protect the person or persons who were responsible for the death of her son. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> &quot;My son went to study in the school and came back in the body bag,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation in death Johnson, as a number of important questions remained unsolved. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> What was the cause of death? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Is his death due to a crime? </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> I follow the facts, the direction in which they lead. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> My goal is to find out the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> &quot;I am of the opinion that a reasonable basis for a formal determination is made,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> Moore told reporters that initial autopsy value implies that Johnson had died from the effects of a &quot;position-related suffocation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> A second autopsy have, however, found a different cause of death, Moore said. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> &quot;There are a number of questions answered or need to be confirmed,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> A representative of the authority of the County Sheriff was at our request on Thursday ready to go immediately to a comment. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> A court in southern Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that have analyzed the investigators. </seg>

<seg id="2126"> John Kerry pointed with an unexpected confession softening of the defensive attitude of the United States in relation to their monitoring programs, saying that espionage was &quot;inappropriate gone too far&quot; in certain cases. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> The Foreign Minister also admitted he wore in common with Barack Obama&apos;s responsibility to ensure that you have switched on &quot;autopilot&quot;, as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA were publicly. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> With the leaked information, the U.S. government is caught in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> When a transmitted by video link address to the Open Government Conference in London Kerry said: &quot;There is no question the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have expired almost on autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was, what is still to the Second World war and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on the 11th September back. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Then he admitted to be the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spy&apos;ve crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights have been abused. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> He said: &quot;In some cases that is too far gone inappropriate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore performs a thorough investigation, so no one needs to feel, think here abuse instead. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Kerry insisted upon, that the NSA is a force for good and many lives were saved by their monitoring operations. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> He added: &quot;We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to devote themselves to blow up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2136"> There is a radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent on killing people to blow into the air and attack governments. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> What would be if you would be able to intercept that and to stop before it happened? </seg>
<seg id="2138"> We actually have plane crashes, attacks on buildings and murdering people prevented because we have learned in advance of such plans. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe in order to dispel the concerns about the alleged American spy and the Europeans to convince them of the need to continue to cooperate in anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and was worried because of their threats, no longer to participate in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the monitoring by the National Security Agency. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> &quot;It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, who first sits as a Democrat in the Senate and as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and the European Affairs is working, in an interview in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> I also go to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have relations with some U.S. allies charged, although the head of the secret service stated this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected from NATO allies and had been replaced with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Other revelations cited on endorsed by Snowden documents, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spy to his allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> In all the tumult Murphy said that his agency prepare the journey of the Congress before, to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> The names of other participating members to be published in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> He said the exact itinerary will still be worked out. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also assumed that there would be some &quot;serious words.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> He said European governments need to be honest about the kind of spying programs that they themselves inserting years their population against. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> &quot;While we can change our monitoring programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy,&quot; said Murphy. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry at the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland in order to deal there with the resentment of the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt, Iran and the U.S. surveillance activities. </seg>

<seg id="2161"> What are the requirements to participate are there? </seg>
<seg id="2162"> The desire should be to realize a building material with a maximum value of 2000 Euro and a (action) day. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> In addition, the winner itself must provide for many hard-working construction worker. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> What&apos;s up with the action and the helpers to? </seg>

<seg id="2168"> Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott have a conflict of interest regarding parental leave </seg>
<seg id="2169"> The billionaire Clive Palmer and MPs says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are pregnant and therefore could benefit from it. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> The mining magnate who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6,000,000 to CO2 tax, put forward the assertion, as if to wipe issues off the table if he were in a conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> The Palmer United Party could take up to four votes in the Senate control, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or truncated. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the Daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the law. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> &quot;He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether they receive holiday or not,&quot; Palmer said. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer with 53-vote lead after the recount officially the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Palmer called for a revision of the process of vote counting, so that, proceeds faster. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Tony Abbotts Töchter Frances und Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Should these elections be held two months after the end of voting? </seg>
<seg id="2178"> &quot;We need a better system,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Why should we not have a system in which we marched in, enters data into a computer, dialed immediately and then at 6:30 clock in the evening was the result? </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> To use it, because then you can erase the results if you do not like one? </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Nowadays tune with pencils is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> The Electoral Commission has the options for electronic voting tested and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Palmer, 59, said that for his policies belong to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take up his new duties &quot;very seriously&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> In a public office was about the service to the public. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Esa decides on major space missions: Missions for Everyone </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Distant planets, black holes or gravitational waves - experts from the European Space Agency to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years now. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> 30 proposals were available, five are still in the race. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Whether there is at least on some of them life, no one knows. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The choice is difficult: If you search for gravitational waves? </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Or rather probe the origin of the cosmos? </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life? </seg>
<seg id="2196"> The questions were just the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> For their program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance research critical. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> The budget for such an &quot;L&quot; missions is about one billion euros each. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The launch is expected in 2028 and 2034. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Early September, met in Paris the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> 30 ideas were discussed, five of which have now come into the shortlist. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Numerous committees examine the proposals, hook at the researchers after. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific program committee. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> A total of four big questions has selected the ESA, to which the missions of the program initiated in 2007 &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; to find answers. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The exact processes involved in the formation of stars of large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> And when a star has planets, under what circumstances can there life arise? </seg>
<seg id="2209"> To answer this question is to start the 2017 Space Telescope &quot;Cheops&quot;, with the 500 previously known planetary systems are examined in more detail in our vicinity. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and so search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: gases which are considered as evidence for biological activity. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> How does the solar system? </seg>
<seg id="2213"> This question will ultimately shed light on what are the requirements for the emergence of life. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In our solar system, these processes examine an example. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> With the &quot;Solar Orbiter&quot; Esa has been a mission of M-class (where the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The probe is to start in 2017 and observe surface area and activity of the sun exactly. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> For the ESA provides for the first of the three L-missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; program. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The probe &quot;Juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts her journey is expected in 2022. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Eight years later they reached Jupiter and is the planet&apos;s atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede investigate. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> What are the basic physical laws of the universe? </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate as to whether our known laws of nature are there still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Maybe you will also find deviations that could physicists point the way to a new theory that can unite under whose umbrella all known laws of nature. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> How did the universe come and what is it made? </seg>
<seg id="2227"> 13.7 billion years ago our universe was created by the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Besides we are familiar matter from which stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through whose work is accelerating the expansion of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> So far, the researchers know neither what physical laws were valid in the first fraction of a second of the Big Bang, nor from which there are dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> With &quot;Euclid&quot; the Esa has also been granted an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> With a special telescope the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Who could make the race </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection process only two. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Has the best chance of a license as L-Mission, according to many experts, &quot;E-Lisa&quot;, a challenging concept for the detection of gravitational waves. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Proved they were not until today. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> The mission provides a two or three probes detector which is stationed in space. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> He could, in contrast to plants on Earth also demonstrate gravitational waves that have arisen during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Four other proposals still compete at the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope named &quot;Athena&quot;, which will explore, among other black holes, &quot;Icy Planets&quot;, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism&quot;, a mission to measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;exoplanet Finder&quot;, which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Already excreted include suggestions for sample return transport from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools </seg>
<seg id="2243"> On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> These are the first such policy that has provided the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children increases with food allergies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent, according to the CDC between 1997 and 2007. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The guidelines provide information for schools, which are to raise awareness of food allergies in faculty and staff and as with children should be handled that show allergic reactions. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine available - Auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction may. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine simple stock. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The report also provides a list of typical symptoms is included, which are called by children having an allergic reaction. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Children may say, &quot;It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue&quot;, &quot;My tongue feels as if it is a hair&quot; or &quot;My tongue tingles&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2255"> Firemen roped off of cliff and rescued the dog from the certain death </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The fire department is to bring a pooch in safety, was stuck on a 15-meter-high ledge in a cliff succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who own the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back to reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> They had desperately searched for her missing dog and cries for help posted on social networks, as they had run away after the small traffic accident in the quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Around 14:15 clock on Wednesday saw a walker, who walked his dog, the Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high heel quarry. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and roped off to save Ruby&apos;s, which was then transported in a dog cage upward. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Andy Clayton, specialist technical rescue team, said: &quot;She was in a dangerous situation. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> She was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the bottom removed. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> She did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was like frozen stiff. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> But now she&apos;s fine. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> She has subsequently eaten a few dog biscuits. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> This was a rather unusual use. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Peter Lau, specialist technical rescue team, said: &quot;Ruby was very lucky.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2270"> There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> Ruby was brought to the vet for examination, but except exhaustion and dehydration nothing found. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;In watching the rescue was scary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2273"> I could not believe that she was really up there. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> It was wonderful to hold them back in the arms. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The vet said that if the fatigue has gotten too big and it would have collapsed, they would probably have crashed. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The firefighters have done a great job. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> It was really brave what they have done. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Scott Alderson from Keighley added: &quot;We were afraid that they would fall off, but it stayed up.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2281"> I can not believe where she was. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Discovered &quot;super tunnel&quot; for drug smuggling: U.S. border </seg>
<seg id="2283"> On the border between Mexico and the U.S. investigators have a &quot;super&quot; tunnel discovered and shut down for drug smuggling. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> As the U.S. customs authorities said that more than 500 meters long tunnel between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system was equipped. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Three suspects were arrested accordingly, seized eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The tunnel had not been reported to be taken in use. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> &quot;These cartels are stupid if they think that they could dig under the radar of time,&quot; said the Attorney General of the U.S. District Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the discovered one end of the tunnel had been. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Addressing the drug gangs assured Duffy: &quot;If you continue to build such tunnels and tries to use them, we are determined to do so at a huge waste of your dirty money&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous battle against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Since 2006, in Mexico more than 77 000 people were killed in connection with drug-related crime. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Constructed by experts </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Because of the elaborate features of the tunnel go investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year to complete. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> The track system was equipped so that there electrically powered cars could be used. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> On the Mexican side of the entrance is in a building that is 80 meters away from the border. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> According to authorities, leads a ladder 20 feet in depth to the actual tunnel entrance. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters wide. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> He would have been so well suited to promote illegal immigration towards the USA. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the seized marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> All three threatened lifetime maximum sentence imprisonment, as officials said. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Since 2006, eight such tunnels were discovered, it was said at the press conference in San Diego on. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> It was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Typically, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through the tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> This shows the &quot;desperation&quot; of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes were now cut off, Bill Sherman said of DEA DEA in San Diego. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> You would do anything to get into the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2308"> Obama&apos;s back down in health policy </seg>
<seg id="2309"> After heavy criticism President Obama made yesterday backtracked on his often repeated unambiguous promise: &quot;If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2310"> After hundreds of thousands from their insurer have received a letter of termination, the Republicans accused the President before the last few days that he had deceived the American public. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Yesterday Obama qualified his original promise. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> &quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> In response to numerous media reports on the dismissal Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices, on, look around on the open market for a new insurance policy. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Most citizens could obtain a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> &quot;You get a better deal,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The government said it is not surprising that the five percent of the population having completed an insurance policy would have to look for another deal, since its contract did not meet the new standards by the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> &quot;I want to tell these Americans very directly: You deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had gone &quot;miserable&quot; since October. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> &quot;I&apos;m as frustrated and angry as everyone else,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I am determined to regain your trust. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> This saying of an applied Sebelius to a seated behind her adviser at yesterday&apos;s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a debate with Republican Deputies Billy Long of Missouri. It was about whether they should be required to participate in Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> After more than three hours hearing Long Sebelius pressed repeatedly with the question of why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act have voluntarily waived a government-sponsored insurance to themselves enter into a collective at HealthCare.gov, which they now sell millions of Americans wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;Sex undetermined&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Germany is the first European nation where a third gender is recognized for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Newborn is assigned no longer rigid male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Under the new law parents have to explain no more sex for such children, but can &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;not set&quot; on the birth certificate specify. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> Objective of the Act is to take the pressure off parents so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding surgery for sex reassignment in the newborn, and to combat discrimination against intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> An intersex person said according to the BBC years later: &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> I remain the patchwork that was created by doctors, maimed and scarred. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> It is estimated that comes one of 2,000 children each year either as a boy or as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;sexual differentiation disorder&quot; (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> Understanding the gender identification is still not very well developed, but guess most experts in the United States, and thus you should use the best information available to gender assignment, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you look at - if at all - decide for surgery. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has focused on the problem of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Intersexed children represent an ethical dilemma </seg>
<seg id="2336"> &quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention is required, but for most children is not that,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how developing the identity. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The scientific data about how a child ever develops his gender identity are not very accurate. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> No one knows why it happens. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> It&apos;s like the secret why people are gay. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> In a report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but because of their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously defined or not clearly identified as one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> These characteristics were evident in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, which intersex and transgender people see exposed in the workplace and the extent of harassment, violence and bias crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Not with the gender image matching boys now have a special camp. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to state on official documents male, female or &quot;third gender&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world&apos;s first &quot;genderless&quot; person after a court lifelong maintenance of an &quot;unspecified&quot; had conceded gender status. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> German ID cards have next to M and W in the future a third assignment, X for intersexual, the Ministry of Interior. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In neighboring France Gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24 </seg>
<seg id="2349"> 2011 signed dozens of French MEP strict Catholic country, a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from textbooks. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds: &quot;If the world is dragged into a new state, where sex is a choice, but not sexual activity, then we rotate two other pillars of civilization. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone, they think it would be better if babies will be assigned a gender at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> &quot;The parenting is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of one&apos;s child,&quot; she told the parents website. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Children need stability and security. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Historically children who were both born with male and female sexual organs, referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Ten years ago, looked at the medical gender as something you could wipe out and then rebuild. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> But now the ethical foundations of an operation be challenged after it is now known how complex gender identity, and that physicians also may be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing with that of their assigned gender. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> &quot;Middle of the 20th Century it was called a psychiatric emergency, &apos;&quot;Drescher said. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> If such a child was born, then you did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that gender is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental stimuli - such as parents raising a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as to whether a person consider to be male or female. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> But in one, known under the title &quot;John / Joan&quot; case from 1966 his theories were controversial. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, to castrate the child completely and remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but what he was not,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> At 38, however, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of gender operations have replaced the public, &quot;not happy with the result&quot; are. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a &quot;satisfying life&quot; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> So its external organ and testes were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> At the age of 12 he received female hormones. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> &quot;I knew that I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com </seg>
<seg id="2373"> I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> At the age of 18, he should get a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> What he found was shocking. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> I was sterilized at birth - and no one has ever told me. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Bruce was born with a DSD, by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> After learning the truth, he transferred back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed himself. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> He has become infertile due to the operation. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersex individuals are perceived as normal. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;encourage stamping and stigmatize&quot; could. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> &quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child with a not fixed &apos;results,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> We fear that favors interventions. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex, and then to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> But still we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adult recognition as a third sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2388"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,&quot; she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> In German law it comes to the assignment at birth. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> This is not a battle, to which one should force young children at this time. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> When they grow, they can decide on their own body. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of other supports in a support group, says the German law &quot;authorize&quot; both parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Today Katie is 29 and married, she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in child psychiatry. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Although she is infertile, hopes, however, to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> &quot;The law gives parents room, so they have to make decisions should not be rushed,&quot; Baratz said. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> It gives them the time to do various tests and to clarify things, giving them time before they &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; writing. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> In this way everything is in order - you pull the child tall and loves it. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> And one must not rush to make an operation that can not be undone. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> &quot;That includes the children in the decision and eliminate the fear that haunts parents, because they think they would not do the right thing,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Ultimately decides the child&apos;s sex, the better suits him - and that is wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Thus children are able to make the decision themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Excellent battle mastered </seg>
<seg id="2407"> The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway&apos;s novella &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, Horst Janson is cut to the body. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Janson is himself a veteran of his craft, the art of acting. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> The old man Santiago none can be fishing kidding. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Thus, the two complement each other great. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> One seems almost to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom saith the fisher boy Manolo. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> When Santiago sits hunched tired of living on the chair, that&apos;s really at Janson. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that copes Janson excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually by his knowledge and his strength of will win the fight against the fish. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Janson is long stretches as sole performer on stage. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> He manages to focus the audience&apos;s attention on himself, so that his monologues no moment are boring. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water, are so real that the audience forget that the sea but consists only of blue illuminated water bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act before the fishing village. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> During the concert, he sets the currently active scene into the light: The cabin of Santiago, the bar is the singer Marie-Luise favor that sings about life in Cuba with her songs and her wonderful voice. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> The four musicians play Cuban rhythm to it and are also guests of the bar </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark? </seg>
<seg id="2422"> A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing in the dark ice - with the help of jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals exploited and transformed it into a brilliant treat. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the glowing protein artificially. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, whereby the pH is raised in the protein and the lights will be triggered. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Chris explains, the ice cream react to the heat and light in the mouth - so the more you lick, the brighter it gets. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Charlie, founder of the ice cream company &quot;Lick Me I&apos;m Delicious&quot;, says: &quot;The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The protein used in the ice cream responsive to the tongue at a neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> When the mouth is heated, the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful glow effect. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> It is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made​​, because of the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Each ball cost me about 140 pounds. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> But for that it tastes delicious. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Charlie&apos;s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf belong. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> But his latest creation to be even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> He says: &quot;I ​​would like to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> That in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is, but I suspect we will find a way to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The ice cream utilizes the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are manufactured by Chinese scientists artificially </seg>

<seg id="2474"> Google, Samsung, Huawei weigh Nortel patents verklagt </seg>
<seg id="2475"> The group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, struggled on Thursday to an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid on the bankruptcy auction of Nortel from him. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Rockstar consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion dollars, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies sued for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> The patents relate to technology, put the search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising in agreement, the suit so that goes to the heart of Google&apos;s search engine business. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that use Google&apos;s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In 2011, Google issued an initial bid over $ 900 million for Nortel&apos;s patents. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Google raised its offer several times and offered last 4.4 billion U.S. dollars. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> After being outbid on the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola&apos;s library of patents. </seg>

<seg id="2521"> About something thinks said &quot;throwaway society&quot; but not after, probably do not even know what this word means actually. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> If you are often on the road at night, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back seat after they partied through the night might look like: clothes, bottles and other trash piled since. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> There were a few bags but also account for more or less nothing - as opposed to the street, where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of others. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> I see already come the day on which the cities and towns, the clearing away is too stupid - and must demand the fast-food chains for their bags pledge. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> Dairy and egg alternatives at a glance </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Pureed tofu with vegetable cream, for example, a quark substitute. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Other names of the Vegetarian Union for Weltvegantag on 1 November. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> The Vegetarian Union Germany proposes occasion of Weltvegantags on 1 November, a series of vegan alternatives: </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Pure vegetable shortening is a good alternative to butter, yogurt&apos;ll replace it with soy yogurt. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> Instead of milk soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Folding plants replace conventional cream whipped cream. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Also, there are herbal alternatives to eggs. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Half a mashed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Also, 50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water suitable for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Locker be held batters with egg, for example, with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of mineral water. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silken tofu can fulfill this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> According to the Vebu to around 800 000 people currently eat vegan, so purely plant in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> A black box in the car? </seg>
<seg id="2540"> U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the crumbling highway system, and believe the solution we have found, is housed in the dashboard of each car in a little black box. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> The devices that record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities, are core point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system of financing of U.S. roads. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> This usually rather boring field of road design has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and speak out in favor of the government, the small boxes to record the number of kilometers - and possibly where they were driven - use and the information can then be used for the calculation of tax assessments. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> But while you can not agree on an approach in Congress, several states do not wait any longer. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> You currently consider how they can change to a system over the next ten years to pay for the drivers per mile driven. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> This really is a must for our country. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> &quot;There is nothing that we will only be able to use,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. Governments of planning a record of miles driven in all California motorists in the state from 2025. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The way how we pay these taxes will change. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The technology for this is there. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The move comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans at the pump is broke. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> But in America not so much fueled as before. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> Cars use less gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen in 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> Politicians dare not at high fuel prices, the tax to raise even one cent. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> &quot;The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> His state has recently 500 cars equipped with tachographs, with which a miles-based payment system to be tested. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> &quot;This is the most sensible long-term alternative,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Bureaucrats refer to it as mile-based user fee. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> It is not surprising that the idea in urban liberals will appeal, because the tax could be used for example to influence the driving behavior so that congestion and greenhouse gases are reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The California planners rely on the system in the development of strategies by which the ambitious statutory goals of the state should be reached on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the most viable see long-term alternative. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Even the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are pleased with the idea to let drivers pay by the distance traveled. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> &quot;This is not a tax, which disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at Reason. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> The people pay directly for what they get. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had asked the Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards mile based charging. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> The U.S. Senate approved last year a $ 90 million expensive pilot project, which would have covered 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> But the majority in the House prevented the advance and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or in the city in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Several states and cities do not move nevertheless on your own in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> On most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> These drivers will pay to the State soon the miles charges instead of mineral oil. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> New York City is also considering such. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Illinois testing to a limited extent with trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> And the I-95 Coalition, to which the transport ministries include 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are researching how to implement the change. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> The concept is not a universal hit. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, drivers were skeptical at the thought that the government could track their every move. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> The people did not want it. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> When the test started off, the ACLU warned of Nevada on their website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in adult monitoring devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2583"> There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> Nevada is one of a number of states that now hold out for affordable technology with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> With that said, Khan, and the public would be killed. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> The Company is not originally occur to help states in the taxation of motorists. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Rather, their goal was to break into an emerging market for car insurance foot, where drivers are supposed to pay on the basis of miles driven. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> But the devices are tested by their interest to the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes were made. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> In Oregon, the planners experiment with it, to give motorists a series of choices. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> You can opt for a unit with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Or they do not select a device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average driven by all the inhabitants of the State of miles. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> Other sites are hoping to sell the concept of a suspicious public, by equipping the device with more features than with fewer. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device on taxation, which also have to pay for parking, insurance must be paid for mileage and speed data from other vehicles in real time are collected, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> &quot;Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to participate,&quot; it says in a planning document of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Some transportation planners wonder, however, whether all the talk about the Pay per mile is not just a giant red herring. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay told officials that Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> An additional one-time fee or an annual fee could be drivers of hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use less gasoline, imposed, so that they pay a fair share. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> &quot;There is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is also sufficient,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists do worry about their privacy, and numerous other things. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> Bad Durrheim-: A dream come true for the FC </seg>
<seg id="2605"> On the importance for the city and the football club&apos;s official opening ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost despite the cold weather and the rain of anything. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> A pleasant ceremony had probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play here. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> So all those out in the cold that came without an umbrella or such a could not hold for some reason. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> That was the musicians who framed the ceremony, just as so many speakers. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Therefore wet was also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> He thanked especially Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been heavily involved for the implementation of the project, the local council, the parties and club members, who brought up. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> Here especially Lothar hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> The sprightly pensioner laid 400 square paving stones of the new routes. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> This remarkable volunteer work also paid tribute to the member of parliament Charles Rombach. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> More Greetings were for urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Frederick Knorr from the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth section of the club. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Mayor Klumpp brought to mind that recurring effects of weather in spring and autumn the original pitch so afflict that he could not be recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, as has been thought of to build a third place at the site of the football clubs or at the Realschule at Salinensee. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> Both were rejected. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> Six years ago, thoughts came to the application of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered as the ultimate solution. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Concrete plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the Schabel exchange at long lease, promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> The council decided in October 2012, the acquisition of the remaining 356 000 EUR in the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Construction of 68 times 108 meter artificial turf took place on 4 June. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> During the three-month-long construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the application of a dirt bike track. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unknown hurt by girls shot from car </seg>
<seg id="2624"> Unknown persons injured in shooting from a car, a twelve year old in Saxony-Anhalt. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The perpetrators probably had fired on Thursday night in Genthin with an air pressure gun at a group of children. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> The police said in the castle. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The girl was slightly injured on his left calf. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> Rescuers brought the girl to the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> The shot came from a small car that was driven past a group of six children and had stopped suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> A disc broke. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Then they drove away. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> The police determined, it said on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Snowden willing to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany in terms of U.S. surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service has stated that he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German Bundestag, when the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander not provide answers about their activities. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele Snowden met on Thursday in Russia, where it has received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> In a letter of Snowden, who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday from Ströbele, writes this: &quot;Even if the result of my efforts was proven to have positive, my government treats dissent continues as unfaithful and attempts to criminalize political expression with criminal threat at which no defense is possible. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2639"> But to tell the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> In the letter Snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government from drop the charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> The charges levied by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk with German officials, then we find ways to make it work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2643"> The relations between the U.S. and Germany are affected by the allegations that NSA had intercepted the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Thomas Oppermann, the deputy, who heads the responsible for the secret parliamentary committee, said that one should take the opportunity to Snowden to listen as a witness, if this was possible, &quot;without endangering him and ruining relations with the United States entirely.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Ströbele, a representative of the Green, published a picture of yourself and Snowden in his Twitter feed. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia when he was leaving the country. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> When Snowden informative in Germany, then he needed an assurance that he is &quot;safe&quot; is there, so the deputy. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself exposed to a &quot;serious and ongoing&quot; campaign of persecution have driven him from his home. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> He was, however, affected by the global response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians - even in the United States - have called the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a credit for the general public. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In his letter Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, &quot;if the difficulties were solved about the humanitarian situation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2653"> Safety concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential people </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the Statue of Samora Machel, the country&apos;s founder and first president of Mozambique to agree peace calls at a rare public demonstration. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;We want peace again, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Fearing for the future of the country they swapped their business attire against a T-shirt saying &quot;We demand security&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement initially ruled by the White Rhodesia and later apartheid government of South Africa was supported in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back again into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> For the fast growing economy, much is at stake, since the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camp in the north-west could be in the next few years investments of over 50 billion U.S. dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko bring from the U.S. into the country. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The ruling Frelimo Party, since 1975, the dominating force, Renamo and give each other the blame for the tensions. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Renamo claimed that the government had the recent clashes provoked by 17 October had its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo attacked. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamo spokesperson told the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The government gives Renamo the blame for the violence and accused the organization of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama consider oneself as a &quot;loser&quot; who &quot;wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can the government impose its decisions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying, Renamo give the peace agreement of 1992. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> Compared to the FT, he stated that he may have meant that Frelimo not respect the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> &quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and that seriously,&quot; Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions that were sparked by a series of clashes this year. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> &quot;We have two grown men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), the heads come together,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> None of them is good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections in November. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Renamo electoral successes shrink since 1992, during a recent party, which is likely to improve in the elections, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM). </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is pending when his second term ends next year - would destroy the country&apos;s democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> &quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he did not want to give up the presidency,&quot; said Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> It is unclear on what capacities Renamo has, but it has taken disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira is located in the but, the port, use the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale on the export of coal. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> In June, Rio interrupted for a month to use the railway, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good,&quot; Mazanga said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> The instability was the frustration over the government further increased, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people were worried already because of corruption, the slow progress of the development and a recent kidnapping wave. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Omar Sultan, a protester, said that people just wanted stability. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Not interested Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2708"> Chinese newspaper is after calling be &quot;reformed&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> A Chinese newspaper, which had called on the title page the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation should be reformed, said a press regulator. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for release of journalist Chen Yongzhou. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partly state-owned company. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Now become the New Express a &quot;comprehensive rectification&quot; subjected, said the regulatory authority. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The &quot;Rektifizierunganordnung&quot; was issued by the Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports of the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> &quot;The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized,&quot; admitted the regulator in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> She said it had decided &quot;to impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to deprive him of his license reporter&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> Chen had several articles for the new Express written, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment named Zoomlion. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> &quot;In this case I Zoomlion damaged as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public,&quot; he told the state news channel CCTV. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> I did it mainly because I was out of money and fame. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> I realized that I had acted wrongly. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Following Chen&apos;s apology from the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they had failed to review the reports correctly. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> Various known suspects have passed recently televised confessions. </seg>

<seg id="2879"> In &quot;Double Down&quot; is said Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; before you finally decided against such a move, after data showed that the candidacy of Clinton&apos;s &quot;chances Obama &quot;would not significantly improve. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Again, switch to the present is a rude awakening, as if one is torn from a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> In the years since I made the first time my voice has actually changed something. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> But it&apos;s just not anything I could have imagined. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has reached, by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the Army and the killing of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> I am also of the view that the party political blockade tactics have tilted too many aspirations, with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> But after the Obama administration I defended towards colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have arrived with my attempts at explanation at the end. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> I have reached a point of political desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> The Republican blockade policy can not explain why one allows listening to foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It can not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished who disclose government wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> It can not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, or why public financing and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the efforts of the White House for the immobilization of the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And jüngstens it can not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act to design a simple website. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> I do not know if it is what I should have expected. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Had I 18 should understand that the government&apos;s work would run counter to their previous political campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Obviously, the deputies Office is not a predictable rate, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre influence the public debate. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> But when I look at the examples above, then they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> And that bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, he did not seem to be able to set its direction and positions. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections would fulfill the hope of which we had heard so long. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> However, with the decline in the approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week to return to the year 2008, this book has become the harder. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> This week I read a passage in the book describes how Obama had to put in the primaries in Pennsylvania a heavy loss against Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> In a meeting with the election workers after deciding he told his employees that they have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> &quot;I want us to find our magic,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We need to remind ourselves who we are. </seg>

<seg id="2970"> In Pfullendorf the current is more expensive </seg>
<seg id="2971"> Citizens Pfullendorfs have to adjust to higher electricity costs. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne bias against the SÜDKURIER confirmed, come to 70 to 90 Euro extra costs per year to a four-member family Pfullendorfer. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> The main reason for the pending price increase is the rise of so-called EEG surcharge of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> This levy shall be fixed annually in October by the four operators of the great new power lines. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> These put them resulting from the energy transition costs, which they can raise by a levy on the electricity price. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Stadtwerke Pfullendorf are the final link in this chain. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> The Supervisory Board of the energy company was even focused in its forecasts of a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne bias reported. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Now the actual pay would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke next week could inform their customers about the exact price increase. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x,&quot; said Bias, and the number will likely be close to 2 cents. </seg>

<seg id="2985"> On the largely emptied stage - important requisite: a crumpled bed, is suggestively copulating and masturbating on the - the eight-member ensemble lurches through the text material. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> This director Fresacher seems to trust the little text. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> The 70-minute performance glossed over the template with a plethora of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Especially the actresses come off at the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transformations. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> They are grabbed me hard, dipped his head under water, stapled with their evening gowns on the wall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Wedged in cellophane or bodice, they teeter dangerously high heeled through the staging, either they monologues loudly or are completely silent on the stage floor. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The text hardly conveys to these strained, however. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> The best moments of the evening has when it is sung - the spectrum ranges from deep purple to include folk songs. </seg>
