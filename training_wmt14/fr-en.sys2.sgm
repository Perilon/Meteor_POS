<seg id="1"> The NSA case underlines the absence of debate on intelligence </seg>
<seg id="2"> How to explain the contradictory attitude of the french government, which on one hand is offended in public by summoning the Ambassador of the United States on October 21, and the other prohibits the overflight by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on Board of Edward Snowden? </seg>
<seg id="3"> In my opinion, there are two levels of response on the part of the french government. </seg>
<seg id="4"> When François Holland phone Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summoned the Ambassador of the United States, they respond to a real discovery, which is the scale of U.S. surveillance on all the papers in France. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the world a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the Quai d&apos;Orsay by the NSA listens? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Is there not as a wave hypocrisy on your part? </seg>
<seg id="7"> The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but research interest and the relevance of information that enables every citizen to form an opinion. </seg>
<seg id="8"> When WikiLeaks uncovers the analysis of politics or other American diplomacy around the world, we consider in fact that, at the sight of American power, this constitutes important insight. </seg>
<seg id="9"> When we describe U.S. interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, is certainly not for us indignant by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Has the France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed our interests? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Can we deprive American collaboration? </seg>
<seg id="12"> The establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools to intercept very powerful by the United States, but the France also, officially was justified by the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Moreover, in this area, the France and the United States in particular were set up almost daily cooperation and information exchange procedures and which are described on part and other as essential. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in Miranshah tribal areas were reported to the French through the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The France can be conducted, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the region of the Sahel to U.S. services, and in return - already quickly said-, Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So the background behind this NSA case question is not so much the ability or the right of countries to develop tools for interception, that the issue of the absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the rationale for such systems, the perimeter which must be their own, and, ultimately, the issue of the attacks on freedoms. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That could really US? a deterioration of their image? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was nice to denounce them, I do not see how they can be punished. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The risk run by Americans may be double. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the peak of their State, have been monitored. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is the case of the Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Another effect may be more economic: more and more European companies or South American Balk, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. service providers subject to U.S. law, and thus to the right-of-way of the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Last item: the extensive revelations move initiated by media around the world, helping to initiate a debate on the monitoring practices intelligence until then virtually non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers that they have given to their intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in full outbreak of violence </seg>
<seg id="25"> The American president was to receive Friday, November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Iraq has known in October its deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures published Friday, November 1st by the Iraqi authorities. </seg>
<seg id="27"> 964 people died in violence in October, 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The United Nations gives a higher with 979 deaths and 1 902 injured same balance. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Such violence are more lethal despite measures enhanced security and large-scale military operations launched by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, the Shia-dominated for months. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Two years after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, the level of violence made fear a new conflagration while the neighboring Syria is embroiled in a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The bombs struck markets, mosques, weddings and funerals. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Men are shot in the street, or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The discontent of the Sunni minority, to the power under Saddam Hussein, who complained of be marginalised politically and be the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this outbreak of violence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Friday, new violence killed four people in the North of the Iraq, in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of bombings, including the explosion of five car bombs North of Baghdad. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Much of the violence was attributed to the Iraq Islamic State and to the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Nouri Al Maliki wants a &apos;global war&apos; against Al-Qaida. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Violence is at the center of talks in the United States by the Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, who will be received Friday by president Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, December 12, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="39"> At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end the military involvement in that country, had pitched an optimistic picture of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Since arriving Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki stepped up meetings with the Executive, and the members of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Thursday, he argued that the international community leads a &quot;third world war&quot; against Al-Qaida. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The principle of increased assistance to the Iraq security is supported by influential Republican and Democrat senators. </seg>
<seg id="43"> But they have also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by its &quot;authoritarian and sectarian policy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They also demanded by Barack Obama to understand to Nouri Al Maliki that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="51"> The Vatican probe on contraception, divorce and homosexuality </seg>
<seg id="52"> The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The survey asked participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat the men and women who live together without being United by the bonds of marriage. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The survey was sent in mid-October at each national conference of the bishops, with the setpoint to get as many responses as possible. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The information will be used in a major rally on the family that Pope François provides organize next year. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The news was reported Thursday by the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="57"> A spokesman for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each Bishop would decide how to probe the parishioners. </seg>

<seg id="62"> Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court Friday. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The new nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking </seg>
<seg id="64"> Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that one takes to smoke a cigarette. </seg>
<seg id="65"> A single dose of the vaccine could protect lives of mice of the nicotine addiction. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Other tests are necessary before testing on humans, but the Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the early signs were encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="67"> &quot;We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,&quot; said Professor Cornell. </seg>
<seg id="68"> The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="69"> The virus infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies selectively. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Antibodies stalk all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have his dose of nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="71"> When tested, vaccinated mice which were given then the nicotine continued their activity normally. </seg>
<seg id="72"> But said them mice that had not been vaccinated were &quot;eased&quot;, the researchers, sign that nicotine had reached their brains. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Previous vaccines against tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Injections must be repeated if frequently for that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and few practices. </seg>
<seg id="76"> But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms into factories to antibody liver cells. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, could administer to children until they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine. </seg>
<seg id="78"> But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking. </seg>
<seg id="79"> &quot;They know that if they begin to smoke, they will take no pleasure because the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this may help them lose their bad habit,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="80"> British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Islamists Egyptians in the streets to denounce the trial of Morsi </seg>
<seg id="82"> Anger is booming in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Two days before the opening of the trial of the ousted president Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets. </seg>

<seg id="85"> This is not a trial underlines this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="86"> So far no lawyer was able to meet him and no volunteer was able to take a copy of the documents of the case. </seg>
<seg id="87"> This is not a trial, this is a farce. </seg>
<seg id="88"> The trial of the president Morsi is a mock trial railed a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the contrary. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Morsi must judge Sisi for Lili, the massacres of Nahda, massacres and the massacre of the Republican Guard. </seg>

<seg id="93"> A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d&apos;Oise </seg>
<seg id="94"> The authorities have announced October 31 that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d&apos;Oise, obviously of foreign origin so that France is free of indigenous cases since 2001. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The kitten was found October 25 to Argenteuil and died on 28 October. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute. </seg>
<seg id="97"> &quot;An epidemiological inquiry has been initiated to identify and support the people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 included,&quot; said the ministries of health and agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="98"> &quot;Five people who had been in contact with the kitten have already been identified&quot; and received preventive treatment. </seg>
<seg id="99"> &quot;In humans, the preventive treatment of rabies human, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective,&quot; said the press release. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Departments now call people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched or licked on mucous membranes or skin injured by this kitten or where the animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The France being free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother were imported from another country, not free&quot;, according to the release. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The Ministry of Agriculture said that the last identified &quot;indigenous&quot; rage case dates back to December 1998 on a Fox and that &quot;the France is declared officially free of the disease in November 2001 by the Office international des epizooties (OIE)&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="103"> A case of rabies on a dog imported illegally Gambia had been registered in 2008. </seg>

<seg id="110"> An Australian appealed against his sentence of imprisonment in Thailand </seg>
<seg id="111"> A resident of Sydney of 21 years, sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in Phuket to have wrongly claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the judgment and has been released on bail. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Stevie Rochelle Bamford first was found guilty by a court in Province of Phuket on 15 June of misrepresentations after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who mastered it, had assaulted her early Sunday, June 10. </seg>
<seg id="113"> However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to his hotel safely after had separated from her Australian boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The Phuket police interviewed Bamford two days before that she admits to having invented the story from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="115"> She was held in a cell of the local police station prior to the hearing before the tribunal. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Bamford was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a prison for women. </seg>
<seg id="117"> It is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter. </seg>

<seg id="124"> Google, Samsung and Huawei make lawsuits relating to Nortel patents </seg>
<seg id="125"> The group, which has thousands of old patents Nortel began an avalanche of lawsuits Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company that he has capped patent at the post during the auction of patents which took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for 4.5 Md$, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement the Court of Assizes of the United States in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony. </seg>
<seg id="128"> Google is accused of violating seven patents. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Patents contain technologies that allow to display advertising in connection with Internet search terms, reported the findings of the trial, which is the core business of Google. </seg>
<seg id="130"> It was not possible to contact representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC, and Rockstar. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufactured phones running the Google Android operating system, which delivers a fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In 2011, Google has made an initial offer of 900 M$ for patents from Nortel. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Google has increased its offer on several occasions, to eventually offer 4.4 Md$. </seg>
<seg id="134"> After losing patent Nortel against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility amounting to 12.5 Md$, a market in part based on the library of Motorola patents. </seg>
<seg id="135"> &quot;Although having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue in the course of the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate patents,&quot; reported the conclusions of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Rockstar claims damages more important against Google, because he claims that the Google patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid </seg>
<seg id="138"> The former New Labour Minister - Joe Tripodi South Wales will be investigated by the anti-corruption of the State regulator. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Former Minister of NSW&apos;s South Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had interests hidden in three properties in the area controlled by the Government. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation to know if Mr. Obeid had put pressure on several Ministers of State to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid have two restaurants and a café, after they expire in August 2005, though it was tender. </seg>
<seg id="141"> It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Under-Secretary-General Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="142"> During the years of discussions in 2005, the Government lobbied to make leases are subject to a call for tenders. </seg>
<seg id="143"> The tenants were against and also wanted longer terms. </seg>
<seg id="144"> In 2009, the leases on businesses from Circular Quay, which related to the Obeid approximately 2.5 M$ per year, have been renewed without that there is no bidding. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially favourable to public tenders. </seg>
<seg id="146"> But he denied having changed its policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, conceded Mr Tripodi, demanded a change in government policy on leases. </seg>
<seg id="147"> The transcript of conversations presented at ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of M Obeid at the Ministry of fisheries. </seg>
<seg id="148"> &quot;Does the subject debated during these telephone conversations was the development of the policy on commercial leases?&quot;, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &apos;No,&apos; replied Mr. Tripodi. </seg>
<seg id="150"> I don&apos;t remember what we discussed, but in any case, this was it. </seg>
<seg id="151"> In any case certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid. </seg>
<seg id="152"> FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not to make a call with their mobile phone) </seg>
<seg id="153"> Airlines passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to play, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talking on their cell phone - under the new highly anticipated guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id="154"> But passengers should not expect immediate changes. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta told a press conference. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and rules concerning storage of devices to be in compliance. </seg>
<seg id="157"> The FAA said that it had already received plans of some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies which have already submitted plans. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;According to the plan, we could approve a wider use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Currently, passengers must switch off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed. </seg>
<seg id="161"> They are not supposed to again them before the aircraft reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the Commander gives go-ahead. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Passengers are supposed to turn off their cameras during the descent of the aircraft before landing and not turn back on until the aircraft is placed. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings, and roll on the ground, said the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi - Fi to higher altitudes, should meet the criteria. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, is said to be pleased by these changes. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Once the new policy implemented safe - and we&apos;ll work closely with carriers for this - it will be beneficial to everyone&quot;, Glading said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="167"> We are frankly tired of feel us like &quot;room guards&quot; when it comes to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="168"> But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, Exchange emails and SMS messages or download data below 10,000 feet, said the Agency. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Passengers must put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So still no Words With Friends, the game online style Scrabble which played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled in large sound of a plane of American Airlines after refusing to turn off his camera while the aircraft was parked at the door. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And heavier equipment such as laptops should always be stored because they could harm someone if they flew through the cabin. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Mobile phones on Board will also continue to be prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing </seg>
<seg id="175"> Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national transport on CBS News security expert, said that the phones were always regarded as presenting a risk. </seg>
<seg id="176"> &quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly cause interference with navigational instruments, but because we know from the FCC, they could disrupt the antennas of mobile phone if they are used on board&quot;, Rosenker said. </seg>
<seg id="177"> An industry Advisory Committee established by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the Government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Pressure on the FAA is strengthened in recent years to ease restrictions on their use. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D - MO., argued that there is no reason valid security for these bans. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The restrictions are also more difficult to implement because the use of the devices became ubiquitous. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to turn off their appliances, or do so deliberately. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The FAA began restricting the use of electronics in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when the passengers were carrying radios FM, the high-tech gadget then. </seg>
<seg id="183"> New airliners depend much more than previous generations of aircraft electrical systems, but they are also designed to withstand the electronic interference and approved by the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi - Fi at altitudes of cruise for several years. </seg>
<seg id="185"> The aircraft modified to accommodate Wi - Fi systems are also resistant to interference. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The vast majority of airliners should permit a wider use of consumer electronics under the new guidelines, said Huerta. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Today&apos;s electronic devices generally emit transmissions radio power much lower than previous generations of devices. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimum transmissions when you turn a page. </seg>
<seg id="189"> But the transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Amazon.com is part of those who are pushing for a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment by passengers. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In 2011, the company commissioned an airliner&apos;s electronic book Kindle readers and did fly to see if there were problems, but there are none. </seg>
<seg id="192"> This inspired the members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA&apos;s mixed feelings as to whether if the use of the equipment is or not a risk. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought that interference from appliances were real, even if the risk was minimal. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Other members of the Committee have said that there are only anecdotal reports from drivers that indicate that devices can interfere with the aircraft systems, and most of them are very old. </seg>
<seg id="195"> However, the Committee has recommended that the FAA allows the drivers to ask passengers to turn off their appliances during instrument landings in low visibility conditions. </seg>
<seg id="196"> A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them full arrangements sense for travelers equipped with technology. </seg>
<seg id="197"> &quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security,&quot; said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association. </seg>
<seg id="198"> The rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board for the time being remain in force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="199"> Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their shelves and their smartphones during take-off and landing despite the gesture of the United States to relax regulations for electronic devices. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The Federal Aviation Administration left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that the passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during phases of flight critical provided that they are in &quot;airplane&quot; mode </seg>
<seg id="201"> Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find painful to not be able to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Australian carriers review decision which requires U.S. carriers to carry out important work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they did not intend in the immediate future to change their procedures. </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it was considering the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="204"> «CASA la has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment in aircraft &quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="205"> The issue is legislation requiring operators of aircraft to ensure the maintenance of security at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA de plans to expand the use of its entertainment system on board using Wi - Fi technology, was open to a change, but said that it would follow the regulator. </seg>
<seg id="207"> &quot;We would positively welcome a review of CASA which would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (of entertainment on board system using Wi - Fi technology) on our aircraft&quot;, said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Qantas said that it met at the moment the current rules. </seg>
<seg id="209"> &quot;In accordance with our policy current, electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we don&apos;t intend in the immediate future to change that,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="210"> The FAA decision applies to American Airlines. </seg>
<seg id="211"> However, we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA decision and the reasons for it. </seg>
<seg id="212"> For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate interference from electronic devices, radio and review manuals, training materials, transportation of carry-on baggage program and the instructions provided to passengers. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Once an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use Lightweight portable electronic devices, such as shelves, readers of electronic books and smartphones at all altitudes&quot;, said the FAA. </seg>
<seg id="215"> In the rare case of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their cameras during the landing. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The Group also recommended that heavier appliances are stowed safely under the seats or in the upper compartments during takeoff and landing. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children at schools </seg>
<seg id="218"> Wednesday, the US Centre of disease prevention and control issued a set of guidelines indicating how to manage food allergies of children at the school. </seg>
<seg id="219"> It is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. Government publishes, since the number of school age children with food allergies has strongly increased. </seg>

<seg id="228"> The Canadian Congress of palliative care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="229"> This is an opportunity for many palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement. </seg>
<seg id="230"> If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to staying at home, very few of them would put an end to their days, according to a spokesman of the Canadian palliative care Association, Maryse Bouvette. </seg>
<seg id="231"> If we put emphasis on palliative care in the Canada, the approach of euthanasia would become minimal. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The President of the network of palliative care in Quebec also rejected the Bill on medical assistance to die. </seg>

<seg id="236"> Ms. Fitzback, also Director of la maison Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, considers that the service would be useless anyway. </seg>
<seg id="237"> We are never asked: &quot;I want to die, give me an injection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The Director of the Association of palliative care of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec Bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="239"> He does not believe that Ontario follow the steps. </seg>
<seg id="240"> For its part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of end of life should be clarified before the Bill is passed. </seg>

<seg id="266"> Nothing is more representative of Halloween as the haunted houses. </seg>
<seg id="267"> They carry the best names, such as &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which is actually a real prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock. </seg>

<seg id="297"> &quot;We ended the talks, it remains more than Ugandan mediation to arrange the signing,&quot; said Roger Lumbala, Vice-Chairman of the delegation of the M23, unless this information can be confirmed immediately by the Government side. </seg>
<seg id="298"> The M23 was born of a revolt, April 2012, former rebels, mainly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id="299"> The United Nations and Kinshasa accusing regularly Uganda and Rwanda support the M23, that refute Kigali and Kampala. </seg>

<seg id="313"> For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between Government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement which was signed more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Renamo was once a rebel movement famous, supported initially by the Rhodesia ruled by white then the Government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country&apos;s independent Government. </seg>
<seg id="315"> After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it has become an opposition party. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population. </seg>
<seg id="317"> The stakes are considerable for the economy growing since the discovery of huge reserves of deposits of coal in the Northwest and offshore gas could attract more than 50 Md$ investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of the Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo will mutually reject responsibility for the tensions. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Renamo says that the Government is behind recent clashes and that it has launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on 17 October. </seg>
<seg id="320"> The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when Government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, spokesman of Renamo, according to the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="321"> The Government makes the Renamo responsible for triggering conflict and accuses him of attacking soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="322"> President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Mr Guebuza said Wednesday to AFP, the French news agency, Mr. Dhlakama himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use all the forces that he had to attempt to prove that he could impose its decisions to the Government. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Frelimo and Renamo insist that they wish to both avoid war. </seg>
<seg id="325"> But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id="326"> He told the FT he meant that the agreement was more respected by Frelimo. </seg>
<seg id="327"> &quot;We want to resume the negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Previous discussions between the parties have failed to reduce tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year. </seg>
<seg id="329"> &quot;These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop to argue,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer of the University open and specialist in Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="330"> None of them knows well negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions. </seg>
<seg id="331"> Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that she boycotterait the municipal elections to be held in November. </seg>
<seg id="332"> The presidential and legislative elections are planned next year. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a movement ill to obtain concessions and a treasure trove of war on the part of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="334"> The share of the votes collected by the Renamo keeps decreasing since 1992, while a new party, the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, should get a lot of votes in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="335"> Mr. Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - which ought to withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country. </seg>
<seg id="336"> &quot;He doesn&apos;t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn&apos;t want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the Presidency,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="337"> We know exactly what is the capacity of the Renamo, but it carried out disruptive Flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South motorway route. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port where the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, exporting coal. </seg>
<seg id="339"> In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after that Renamo has threatened to attack the railway line. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo réitèreraient this threat. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not well in Mozambique&quot;, said Mr. Mazanga. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The instability has strengthened the frustration aroused by the Government, said Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings. </seg>
<seg id="343"> &quot;People think that the future of the country are the Government and the president, and that is to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people wanted only to stability. </seg>
<seg id="345"> «Nobody cares Renamo or Frelimo, they want just to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads, he added. </seg>

<seg id="360"> Coulson has used the phone hacking to check a pipe </seg>
<seg id="361"> The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used &quot;the phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a phony pipe on a route involving the Minister of the Interior then in office, Charles Clarke. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said the Court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his &apos;pretty special adviser. </seg>
<seg id="363"> It was reported to the Court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, hack Pawlby voicemail box and &quot;plant permanently outside her door&quot;, but Coulson also called her and left him voice messages. </seg>
<seg id="364"> «The charge suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor-in-Chief of NotW, isn&apos;t the kind of man to remain in the House of the people hoping to surprise them, this is the kind of man to love to tell the story to people to see what they say», said Mr Edis. </seg>
<seg id="365"> He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: the phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="366"> The Chief Editor is personally involved in the third. </seg>
<seg id="367"> It is obvious that it is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="368"> But what is the first? </seg>
<seg id="369"> There knowledge of the phone hacking? </seg>
<seg id="370"> It says otherwise, but we say &apos;of course that if. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were taken over first by the NotW editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction towards Miss Pawlby, stated that he had been told: &quot;don&apos;t waste your time with it, it is with Charles. </seg>
<seg id="372"> A band, on which were recorded voice messages hacked on his phone on at least three occasions, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective who were Miss Pawlby and his sister arranged in a folder &quot;projects&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="374"> During the period where the detective has investigated it, Miss Pawlby grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information on it, said Mr Edis. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised monitoring of every fact and Miss Pawlby gestures. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In a voicemail that he left on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: &quot;I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="377"> Mr Edis said that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett. </seg>
<seg id="378"> The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while himself attended the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted having carried out the phone hacking. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Bailout of 325 M$ for the system of health of Tasmania </seg>
<seg id="382"> The federal Government maintains that bailout of 325 M$ for health system wobbling is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the State Government will not waste the funds. </seg>
<seg id="383"> The Federal Minister of health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island State, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The funding over 4 years, decided after consultations of the Government with the independent MP for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="385"> &quot;The Government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which we will solve the unique challenges faced by the State&quot;, said Ms. Plibersek today. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The plan of 325 M$ includes a campaign of 31 M$ for non-urgent surgical operations. </seg>
<seg id="387"> 2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Funds are also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care and the medical training, services dedicated to mental health and deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;These investments meet the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, it&apos;s the best way to treat the Tasmania health system&quot;, said Ms. Plibersek. </seg>
<seg id="390"> The Minister said that the Tasmanian Government would be faced with a strict regime for the preparation of reports and accountability. </seg>
<seg id="391"> The State shall maintain current funding levels to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends additional funds. </seg>
<seg id="392"> A commission composed of three persons will be incorporated to ensure that the State provides services more efficiently and efficiently as possible. </seg>
<seg id="393"> Mr Wilkie said today that 325 M$ will not count for much &quot;unless they are followed by a genuine reform to strengthen the public health system in Tasmania. </seg>
<seg id="394"> It nevertheless commended the Government for responding to the urgent aid application submitted to the Prime Minister early May. </seg>
<seg id="395"> &quot;I hope that federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system of Tasmania from the black list,&quot; said Mr. Wilkie. </seg>
<seg id="396"> According to the Government of the State, these additional elective procedures reverse largely the recent cuts. </seg>
<seg id="397"> But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton think that today&apos;s announcement is a &quot;a quick fix. </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;The reason we are here is that the Labour Government in the State has withdrawn 430 M$ of its health system&quot;, he said on ABC TV. </seg>
<seg id="399"> It is impossible to have a Government of the State which puller almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth which puts 300 M$, and pretend it&apos;s an auspicious day. </seg>
<seg id="400"> Mr. Dutton made visit to Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of bailout will be spent in bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="401"> He walks in the mud, the jungle and crossed rivers to provide free medical assistance </seg>
<seg id="402"> Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon </seg>
<seg id="403"> Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all of their weekends to see hundreds of patients </seg>
<seg id="404"> There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="405"> Vote here or via your mobile device </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN hero of the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="407"> You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for it &apos;Heroes CNN of the year&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="408"> This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work. </seg>
<seg id="409"> For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visiting hospitals that were not equipped for him come help. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Initially, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would bear the consequences the rest of his life. </seg>
<seg id="412"> &quot;There are no neurosurgeons in Cameroon&quot;, said Georges Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="413"> We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Instead, Dr Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father in clinics and hospitals crowded, so he gets any treatment which he could benefit. </seg>
<seg id="415"> &quot;This is not easy,&quot; adds Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="416"> You can leave the House at 5 o&apos;clock, rush you to the hospital to be the first, and you&apos;re not the first. </seg>
<seg id="417"> There are many patients. </seg>
<seg id="418"> People can die because they wait too long. </seg>
<seg id="419"> The situation has not changed since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="420"> In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization. </seg>
<seg id="421"> By comparison, the ratio in the United States is to 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="422"> And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians couldn&apos;t pay the consultation. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Two people out of five in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country&apos;s health spending are carried out in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="424"> &quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; explained Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="425"> And because of poverty, they can&apos;t enjoy life. </seg>
<seg id="426"> After seeing his father and as many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have practiced more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year. </seg>
<seg id="428"> He became doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé. </seg>
<seg id="429"> And he created a humanitarian association non-profit, ASCOVIME, who goes to rural areas during the weekends for free health care. </seg>
<seg id="430"> Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they are crammed into vans after attaching the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get in the villages who most need help. </seg>
<seg id="432"> The chance do not always follow them. </seg>
<seg id="433"> They repeatedly had to push the vehicle to cross rivers or muddy tracks. </seg>
<seg id="434"> But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: the community organizes a celebration, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available. </seg>
<seg id="435"> In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with her big smile and his energetic - is more than happy to join in the festivities. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients. </seg>
<seg id="437"> &quot;We get 500 people at each visit&quot;, said Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="438"> They live sometimes to 60 km from the village, and they come on foot. </seg>
<seg id="439"> In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate - document needed to go to school, but many poor families cannot simply cannot afford to buy it. </seg>
<seg id="442"> In the evening, the team practice simple surgical acts under local anesthesia. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Operations are generally performed in a school, a town hall or a House; After the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave his room for the next person. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Through the generator lighting, operating room and the sterilization of equipment, Dr. Bwelle and its volunteers are working until the early hours Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="445"> It is a grueling pace, but musicians from the villages help in general the team to stay motivated. </seg>
<seg id="446"> &quot;They knock on drums all night to keep awake to us so that we can continue to work&quot;, explained Mr Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="447"> On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work she has done. </seg>
<seg id="448"> The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practised 700 surgical free during last year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they are helping. </seg>
<seg id="449"> A man explained that the operation free that he had suffered to treat a hernia would allow it to work again. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;This will change my future and that of my family,&quot; said the man. </seg>
<seg id="451"> In addition to live this roving hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private around Yaoundé medical practices. </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is this second job, he explains, which funds 60% its association; the rest is covered by private donations. </seg>
<seg id="453"> &quot;I do not know when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O&apos;Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Group of Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="454"> It is still in the hospital or trying to find money for its association in order to carry out these campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="455"> This is an opportunity for medical students and nursing students as Katie O&apos;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, learning on the ground that they do not have at home. </seg>
<seg id="456"> &quot;It could participate in operations to help absorb blood or pass instruments to Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explained Miss O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you&apos;re a medical student in the second year. </seg>
<seg id="458"> Student volunteers pay in general their trip to Cameroon, and often come with collected medical equipment. </seg>
<seg id="459"> But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, their transportation and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;He is a hero, there&apos;s no doubt,&quot; said Katie O&apos;Malley. </seg>
<seg id="461"> He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly shut down. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For Dr. Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a fix. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Help others live happily taking the promise he made to his father is something that brings him an immense joy. </seg>
<seg id="464"> &quot;I am so happy when I do this work,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle. </seg>
<seg id="465"> And I think of my father. </seg>
<seg id="466"> I hope he sees what I&apos;m doing. </seg>
<seg id="467"> Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons which lead me to do this. </seg>

<seg id="470"> The Interior has bucket seats and belts 6 point harness, as well as an Intercom System. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Among the options, include improved brakes, a service giving access to the Bowler Works engineers, logistics and storage of the vehicle between two events. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Drew Bowler, Bowler Motorsport Director-general said: &quot;rally fans who join Bowler have changed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="473"> They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events. </seg>
<seg id="474"> We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallies to the United Kingdom and abroad, and to prepare the rigors and realities of rally raids. </seg>

<seg id="477"> The two France&apos;s Pierre Nora </seg>
<seg id="478"> Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Professor in the amphitheatres and classrooms? </seg>
<seg id="480"> No doubt, but pointing out his weakness for the roads, Sciences-Po, des Hautes Etudes. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Arbitrator of the works of others in his office of Gaston Gallimard Street? </seg>
<seg id="482"> Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the Publisher. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Heir of the Chair held Fontenelle to the Académie française? </seg>
<seg id="484"> Still, but knowing that a such sacred cannot replace the real holy oil, one of the thesis, which has happened. </seg>
<seg id="485"> They readily recognized in him a great awakener, host and unifier of their work, but noting that he was reluctant to produce itself. </seg>
<seg id="486"> This uncertain image the monument of &quot;Places of memory&quot;, to which he attached his name, has also contributed. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Nasty languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by a commentator intelligent, with a bright look and leste scholarship, but incurably dilettante. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The two books published by Nora here soon two years have already established that one who passed for not writing were many and well written. </seg>
<seg id="489"> The book that here should definitively justice it. </seg>
<seg id="490"> There are yet once more, the temptation to Ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation jump as at attached feet from one topic to another. </seg>
<seg id="491"> But one understands quickly of disparate objects collected in this book to the so beautiful title bringing the Junkman with a single passion: to discover the constituent node of the French identity. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Why these dramatic calls for national unity? </seg>
<seg id="493"> Identity: this is a concern of time. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Here are few, we have collectively invited to give a definition. </seg>
<seg id="495"> But in the assertive spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence. </seg>
<seg id="496"> It should deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters. </seg>
<seg id="497"> That stalking Pierre Nora is quite different. </seg>
<seg id="498"> It does not arise in an eternal Francité heir, he refuses to the definition. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Analyst worried a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at each step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented irritating questions. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Whose thereof, that arises from the enterprise itself: why, in a country if permanently installed in its borders, if formerly structured and securely masoned, meant these dramatic appeals for unity? </seg>
<seg id="501"> They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to stave off disorder born of the discord of French history. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and protestants: the forces of division, here are very old. </seg>
<seg id="503"> And the most emblematic is obviously one that splits into two national history. </seg>
<seg id="504"> From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two types of nations, monarchical and the other revolutionary. </seg>
<seg id="505"> The second wanted the death of the first, but to deny; concerned instead to find the sacredness and even more Avid unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head to that which was the obvious and powerful incarnation. </seg>
<seg id="506"> And then a nation immediately binary, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution. </seg>
<seg id="507"> To make feel this singularity of French identity, nothing beats the four not out of France, so Pierre Nora American getaway could well be the heart of his book. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Because America and the France have one and one makes a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society. </seg>
<seg id="509"> But the American cousin does that better highlight what we own. </seg>
<seg id="510"> There, men who had left their old Regime in England and had more to worry about. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Here, men crowded an Ancien Régime native and even more radical. </seg>
<seg id="512"> There a revolution consensual when here she planted the drama and confit. </seg>
<seg id="513"> There always honored founders, and here the revolutionary ancestors which we barely do models, and that the rest ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="514"> There an institutional stability, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many errors to catch up and testing to resume. </seg>
<seg id="515"> The France that goes, the France that comes </seg>
<seg id="516"> Yet there was a time where the French have believed she could sew up the dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the two sales. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This third Republic, while central and creator, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, by teaching students what in the former France preparing darkly modern France and offering them a version unified in their history. </seg>
<seg id="518"> But this peaceful identity has had a time. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Here it is again in debate, shoved by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European area. </seg>
<seg id="520"> The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of the France that goes and cautious sketch of the France coming. </seg>
<seg id="521"> With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises. </seg>
<seg id="522"> We discover that the Zain was a homebody. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Man of multiple sights revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The Prowler&apos;s edges stood in the center of downtown. </seg>
<seg id="525"> And one who had filed here over half a century, a topic on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, says, cum grano salis, that it will eventually make it. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Certainly a less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle form. </seg>
<seg id="527"> But let us not misunderstand just as binding. </seg>
<seg id="528"> Because rather than imposed figure of the University curriculum, this thesis above says the inner need of a life. </seg>
<seg id="529"> How biometrics will invade our lives </seg>
<seg id="530"> Finished passwords to type to access its smartphone or pay purchases? </seg>
<seg id="531"> American, french and Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors phones and computers. </seg>
<seg id="532"> Bernard Didier, Deputy CEO of Morpho, considers even that &quot;the century will be biometric&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe also transverse and transnational than the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but are worried. </seg>
<seg id="535"> Alone in 2011 and in France, the National Commission of computing and freedoms allowed 774 systems of recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or venous network of the hand in businesses, administrations, canteens... </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Everyone can soon be identified anywhere and anytime,&quot; has moved Justin Brookman, responsible for the privacy of consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="537"> The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, in others? </seg>
<seg id="538"> Biometrics will rely on new techniques, which will help make new services to citizens and consumers. </seg>
<seg id="539"> Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the Palm or the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="540"> But each of these techniques has its constraints. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;For example, some people who work the concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,&quot; notes Philippe Robin, technical director at Thales Communications &amp;amp; Security identity. </seg>
<seg id="542"> And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume something voluntary and specific people. </seg>
<seg id="543"> This is both a security - cannot capture these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Therefore, searches are conducted since twenty years on other approaches, such as recognition of the face or the iris (the colored eye part). </seg>
<seg id="545"> Thanks to the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and calculation capacity of computers for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The accuracy of face recognition has multiplied tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of the laboratories of R &amp; D of Accenture in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="547"> With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed with automatic border using face recognition. </seg>
<seg id="548"> It is now possible to identify a face or an iris on the move. </seg>
<seg id="549"> &quot;Today, we are conducting research on the recognition of the voice or how to walk using sound sensors, but need a quiet environment,&quot; says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of research on safety at Intel Labs. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Unique and tamperproof, the DNA marker also raises hopes and concerns. </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data&quot;, confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of studies, innovation and foresight to the CNIL. </seg>
<seg id="552"> But DNA analysis is still very long and costly. </seg>
<seg id="553"> NEC offers to the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples on the place of a crime and in an hour. </seg>
<seg id="554"> The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (make sure that the person is that she claims to be). </seg>
<seg id="555"> The identification was so far the issuance of identity papers: we must confront biometric (fingerprint, picture, iris) with the information the State has on citizens already identified. </seg>
<seg id="556"> This ensures that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else. </seg>
<seg id="557"> This principle of comparison may have other applications. </seg>
<seg id="558"> NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store. </seg>
<seg id="559"> &quot;We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to pictures of the celebrities which circulate freely on the Internet,&quot; says Dany Nassif, loaded, at NEC France, business development for biometric identification solutions. </seg>
<seg id="560"> Other use: take a photo a nobody who makes the tail in a store, follow his progress through the facial recognition and calculate waiting time. </seg>
<seg id="561"> Authentication was initially the physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening of a computer). </seg>
<seg id="562"> Are added, more recently, control of presence. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;A biometric time clock avoids the phenomenon of buddy that points to another&quot;, justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture. </seg>
<seg id="564"> But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from Internet-connected devices. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this action replaces the striking of the secret code. </seg>
<seg id="566"> A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d&apos;Ascq and in Angouleme the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and retail brands: at the time of pay in store with his credit card, the client does not tape its code, but inserts his finger into a drive that scans the veins. </seg>
<seg id="567"> The experiment is expected to last six months. </seg>
<seg id="568"> If it is successful, the biometric readers may soon arrive at french merchants. </seg>
<seg id="569"> Clues to reassure users </seg>
<seg id="570"> There are three ways to make the seductive biometrics in the eyes of the general public. </seg>
<seg id="571"> The first is to explain that it can save time. </seg>
<seg id="572"> &quot;If, thanks to biometrics, a client is thirty seconds less cash, it is significant,&quot; says the Director of a large area. </seg>
<seg id="573"> The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer custom options. </seg>
<seg id="574"> And, finally, reassure, highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases. </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;The fingerprints are stored on one server; &quot;the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which hangs when trying to move&quot;, enumerates Philippe Robin, Thales. </seg>
<seg id="576"> But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Specialists in the protection of private life, they continue to worry about. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: a blanket surveillance&quot;, predicted Andrew Patrick, Office of the Commissioner for the protection of privacy in the Canada. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Frontier Airlines plans to pay luggage handbags </seg>
<seg id="580"> Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying the carry-on baggage on its flights. </seg>
<seg id="581"> Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a bag in hand and $2 for a cup of coffee or a soda, although only in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the bobbin not open with them on the descent of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="582"> The new hand baggage charges concern bags stowed in the overhead compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will be always free. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if passengers paid only once at the boarding gate. </seg>
<seg id="584"> The Frontier spokeswoman, Kate O&apos;Malley has indicated that $100 were expected to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance. </seg>
<seg id="585"> &quot;We do want to pay this price&quot;, she explained. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Airlines have begun to charge first and second baggage in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in the hand baggage stowed in the upper compartments, so there&apos;s often more space in these compartments. </seg>
<seg id="588"> These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board. </seg>
<seg id="589"> O&apos;Malley said that these new fees would not really serve to collect money. </seg>
<seg id="590"> This is to impress upon the Frontier of most loyal customers that it becomes increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments. </seg>
<seg id="591"> Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline site will not have to pay. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Thus, a passenger queuing at a boarding gate Frontier could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail could have to pay $100 for a similar bag. </seg>
<seg id="593"> O&apos;Malley explained that the site and the procedures for registration of Frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these costs before you get to the door. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Frontier carry-on baggage fees will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other costs, but the airlines love them. </seg>
<seg id="596"> They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Good number of people on Wall Street consider the addition of charge of baggage as a sign that proved that the airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Yet many of them have not touched at the expense of luggage. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied first luggage fees to hand three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant airline followed a little later. </seg>
<seg id="600"> The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the supplement charge. </seg>
<seg id="601"> It felt, in a report by December 2011, that Spirit carry-on baggage fees were 50 M$ per year. </seg>
<seg id="602"> Sorensen, a former Executive of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate at the time where the passengers would find baggage charges unusual hand imposed by the company. </seg>
<seg id="603"> &quot;I had never seen a my entire professional career as fluid boarding procedure,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="604"> I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door. </seg>
<seg id="605"> The plane was full, he added, &quot;passengers are mounted on Board at the speed of lightning&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Frontier is also as Spirit and applies charges $ 2 for a cup of coffee, tea, a soda or fruit juice. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the bobbin not open with them, and those who take coffee can be reused free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="608"> It will distribute still water free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="609"> US Airways has briefly attempted to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed. </seg>
<seg id="610"> The decision of Frontier to pay baggage fees when passengers do not directly purchase their ticket at the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website. </seg>
<seg id="611"> Airlines pay sellers to online travel as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold. </seg>
<seg id="612"> This prompted all airlines encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of apply to an online travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, Frontier has gone further in this area. </seg>
<seg id="614"> In September, it began to offer half of miles of loyalty to customers who purchased their ticket through a travel agency online. </seg>

<seg id="621"> Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are related to his mood. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Previous studies had shown that happy dogs while more their tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs the move more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="623"> But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond. </seg>
<seg id="624"> Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;everyone knows that, in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="625"> Here, we have tried to see what was in other species. </seg>
<seg id="626"> He added that even in humans, dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and both hemispheres played a different role in the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="627"> To learn more about how the dogs respond to disordered other dogs tail movements, the researchers tracked animals watching movies that featured other dogs. </seg>
<seg id="628"> They measured heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior. </seg>
<seg id="629"> We should surely not long before that we understand why their tails sometimes goes on one side and the other sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="630"> Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;we presented to dogs of the films which included other dogs - either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor - and we were able to tamper with the movement of the tail and to present it as more left or right. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="631"> When the animals saw a dog without expression stir the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="632"> But when they have spotted a tail deflect primarily left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate accelerated, and they looked anxious. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Professor Vallortigara said that he did not believe that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements. </seg>
<seg id="634"> He thinks rather that dogs know from experience the movements that they should or should not worry. </seg>
<seg id="635"> He added: &quot;If you repeatedly meet other dogs and if you notice, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you react based on that experience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="636"> Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the school of veterinary science of the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the canine species. </seg>
<seg id="638"> Last year, a team of Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned the head to the left when they watched a dog aggressive and right when it was a happy dog. </seg>
<seg id="639"> And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in the Canada, stated: &quot;dogs were more easily to a robot dog when his cock stirred to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxiety - the reverse of what is contained in the Italian study.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="640"> He said that the differences could come that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider films animals or robots as dogs dogs. </seg>
<seg id="641"> A study on how the dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained. </seg>
<seg id="642"> &quot;Although many elements, identified in different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="643"> However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be saved, we should surely not long before that we understand why their tails move sometimes on one side and the other sometimes. </seg>

<seg id="667"> Barack Obama gave order to the National Security Agency (NSA) to terminate the listens that she practiced on the international monetary fund and the World Bank in the context of its intelligence activities, says a U.S. official Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="668"> This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to regain control in the case of eavesdropping by the NSA after the revelations made by the former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="669"> It is the first time that is referred to the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the Agency of information since the beginning of the scandal. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Questioned on the subject, an official of the US administration said: &quot;The United States lead no electronic monitoring for the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify if such monitoring had been implemented in the past. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Another official, him, indicated that Barack Obama had given orders to cease such practices in the past weeks. </seg>
<seg id="673"> This statement has been given roughly at the same time as that ending the plays of the headquarters of the United Nations in New York. </seg>

<seg id="702"> The Congolese army hunts down rebels of the M23 </seg>
<seg id="703"> The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were chasing the rebels in the M23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda. </seg>
<seg id="704"> The M23 appears about to be beaten after being driven out of the towns of the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), he controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the uprising. </seg>
<seg id="705"> &quot;We will continue the M23 and cornering it everywhere where it is hiding because it is criminals,&quot; told Reuters colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC. </seg>
<seg id="706"> We must not let them reorganize because they martyrisent the Congolese people for too long. </seg>
<seg id="707"> The time has come to bring peace. </seg>

<seg id="709"> These, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa Government and the M23. </seg>
<seg id="710"> Clashes are reported in the hills that overlook Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 has emerged in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="711"> At their peak in November, insurgents have occupied Goma, capital of Nord-Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the Government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers. </seg>
<seg id="712"> The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the most important in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and form a quick readiness brigade composed of South African soldiers, Malawian and Tanzanian. </seg>
<seg id="713"> Meanwhile, the General staff of the FARDC has been redesigned and the Army went on the offensive against the M23, which change the course of the war. </seg>
<seg id="714"> The rate of progression of government troops today is unprecedented. </seg>
<seg id="715"> &quot;The M23 seems to an end,&quot; predicted one expert from Congolese Affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa. </seg>
<seg id="716"> It would be historic - this would be the first time that the Kinshasa Government manages to beat a major insurgency. </seg>
<seg id="717"> And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the East of the DRC. </seg>
<seg id="718"> The UN experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it fiercely, to militarily support the M23, formed initially mutinous Congolese ex-servicemen. </seg>
<seg id="719"> The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited the Rwandan president Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office. </seg>

<seg id="724"> John Kerry has admitted an unprecedented, that the American espionage «had gone too far inappropriately» </seg>
<seg id="725"> John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States with regard to its assuming, monitoring programmes is unprecedented, that on several occasions, espionage &quot;had gone too far in an inappropriate way&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on &apos;automatic pilot&apos; when a series of incendiary revelations of the Edward Snowden informer about the NSA spying activities has emerged. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The leaks have developed the American Government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;it is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the Government are aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, since the second world war and until the difficult of the cold war, then of course September 11. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="729"> He then became the first senior member of the Government of the United States to admit that the American espionage had crossed the line, but insisted on the fact that each rights had not been violated. </seg>
<seg id="730"> He said: &quot;In some cases, it went too far from inappropriately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="731"> And the President is committed to trying to clarify and make it clear to people it was now engaged in a careful review of these practices so that nobody feels cheated. </seg>
<seg id="732"> I assure you that innocent people will not abuse the process. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Mr. Kerry has insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives. </seg>
<seg id="734"> He added: &quot;We live in a new world where people are willing to jump.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="735"> There is a radical extremism in the world who is determined to try to kill people, explode and addressed by Governments. </seg>
<seg id="736"> And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act? </seg>
<seg id="737"> We have indeed prevented aircraft from falling, buildings exploding and people being killed because we were able to take knowledge of the facts in advance. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to respond to concerns about alleged American espionage case and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight against terrorism with the United States, said Thursday the president of the Senate on European Affairs Subcommittee. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he spoke before members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of the anti-terrorist organizations due to the sense of frustration about the National Security Agency surveillance. </seg>
<seg id="740"> &quot;It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Senate, in an interview from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="741"> And I am going in Europe for to make them it clear that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs. </seg>
<seg id="742"> The press reports that NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some allies of the United States, however the Director of the Agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that the NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of State. </seg>
<seg id="744"> The Director of intelligence, James Clapper, a justified spying on allies indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice for both sides. </seg>
<seg id="745"> In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip for the Congress, which is expected to take place this year and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The names of other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days. </seg>
<seg id="747"> He indicated that the route remained to be defined. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, but also to show &quot;tough love&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="749"> He explained that the European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs that they apply themselves for years. </seg>
<seg id="750"> &quot;We can modify our monitoring programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to espionage,&quot; said Murphy. </seg>
<seg id="751"> In the meantime, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to handle the resentment generated by American policies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States surveillance activities. </seg>

<seg id="756"> For the CEO of Titan, &quot;the proposed purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee&quot; </seg>
<seg id="757"> After throwing the sponge with a bang in January for the partial resumption of Goodyear of Amiens-North site promised closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the U.S. negative Titan, expresses, today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 account the factory. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of productive recovery, had already announced, Monday, October 21. </seg>
<seg id="759"> After giving up the proposed purchase of the plant in January, you come back today. </seg>
<seg id="760"> You had said violent attacks and insults, in speaking of &quot;so-called workers&quot;, &quot;working three hours&quot; per day, unions &quot;crazy&quot;, for the CGT. </seg>
<seg id="761"> It does not include this about-face. </seg>
<seg id="762"> Is - to bring pleasure to Mr. Montebourg? </seg>
<seg id="763"> I try to please anyone. </seg>
<seg id="764"> Except my wife. </seg>
<seg id="765"> Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid. </seg>
<seg id="766"> If I hurt someone by my words, I am sorry. </seg>
<seg id="767"> But the France has a high tax and unemployment also. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The truth does it hurt you? </seg>
<seg id="769"> Work seven hours a day when other countries working eight hours disabled the France. </seg>
<seg id="770"> In India, in China and in full elsewhere, working 10 to 12 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But I have no prejudices on the France. </seg>
<seg id="772"> What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good facilities and is well situated and has space to grow. </seg>
<seg id="773"> Why Titan has so much need for this plant? </seg>
<seg id="774"> Titan has no need to buy this plant. </seg>
<seg id="775"> But with a fair price and skilled workers, it is worth trying. </seg>
<seg id="776"> What type of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear? </seg>
<seg id="777"> If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think that 100% of the employees have accepted it. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Now, imagine that Titan buys Goodyear closed factory. </seg>
<seg id="779"> Therefore, Titan could move the machines to the Poland or any other country of the European Union that still has its own currency. </seg>
<seg id="780"> I think Mr. Montebourg knows this. </seg>
<seg id="781"> However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paying jobs. </seg>
<seg id="782"> Titan accepts to recruit among some 1,200 current employees of Goodyear. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Also Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment of Titan before attempting to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The first step is the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Therefore, there is more employees in the factory. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Mr. Montebourg said that you were willing to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Confirm you? </seg>
<seg id="788"> The only number I have mentioned to the Minister, it is 333. </seg>
<seg id="789"> I know that he would like a four year warranty. </seg>
<seg id="790"> But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay. </seg>
<seg id="791"> If all employees accept them, the proposed purchase of the plant starts with zero employee. </seg>
<seg id="792"> How can we give guarantees of job duration when there are more people on the site? </seg>
<seg id="793"> If Mr. Montebourg what the CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buys the factory, we have well intend to stay in Amiens North more than four years. </seg>

<seg id="821"> Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf of anglo-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: &quot;you may be well-intentioned, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="822"> Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope. </seg>
<seg id="823"> Not that everything should be simplified or finish well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil. </seg>
<seg id="824"> And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than being declared. </seg>

<seg id="826"> Green light from the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merge </seg>
<seg id="827"> Publicis and Omnicom said Friday had received no objection on the part of the US authorities to their merger, approximating thus to the creation of the first global advertising agency. </seg>

<seg id="829"> &quot;Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiration of the prescribed time of consideration of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended&quot;, announce the two groups in a press release. </seg>
<seg id="830"> They indicate that they have also received the necessary permissions in the Canada, India and Turkey, after the South Africa and South Korea. </seg>
<seg id="831"> The expiry of the period of review under the HSR in the US and issued authorization decisions in other jurisdictions meet many of the conditions necessary for the realization of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="832"> &quot;The merger is also conditioned to obtaining other regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups&quot;, they added. </seg>
<seg id="833"> New class action against the Holy Cross brothers </seg>
<seg id="834"> A new application of class action filed against the brothers of Holy Cross, concerning sexual assaults which would be held this time at Saint Joseph&apos;s oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools. </seg>
<seg id="835"> The query relies on the testimony of the applicant, identified as &quot;J. J&quot;., which would have masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher submitted brother and then by her confessor, father Bernard, at the St. Joseph&apos;s oratory, where he was serving mass and where his father worked as a painter. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The first appeal did only three establishments, and when it was announced the regulation, many people told us: &apos;I was at a particular location, can I register?&apos;, says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two actions. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The lawsuit which has just been tabled is to feature to allow the addition of complainants of any establishment where abuse could be perpetrated by members of the congregation of Holy Cross. </seg>
<seg id="838"> At the present time, the appeal brings complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers. </seg>
<seg id="839"> The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since many of the institutions concerned have closed their doors in the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The use also stresses that the congregation of Holy Cross and the St. Joseph&apos;s oratory, which is a separate entity, &quot;have enabled sexual abuse are perpetrated against children&quot;, that they &quot;exercised a moral, religious and psychological victims constraint&quot;, that they &quot;were aware of sexual abuse perpetrated and them have nevertheless choked&quot;, and that they have &quot;knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="841"> These latest accusations are based inter alia on letters written by counsel for the St. Croix, Me Émile Perrin brothers, in the 1990s, but also by the research done in the archives in this regard by brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Holy Cross brother who publicly denounced the abuse. </seg>
<seg id="842"> Collective redress must first pass the stage of admissibility in the superior court. </seg>
<seg id="843"> Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, we proceeded to the second step, either the hearings on the merits. </seg>

<seg id="861"> The Court blocked a decision on policy control and excavation of the NYPD </seg>
<seg id="862"> A federal appeals court has blocked Thursday the decision of a judge requiring changes in the program control and search of the New York City police department and it has been divested of the folder. </seg>
<seg id="863"> The Court of appeal of the United States second circuit) stated that the decision of judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal by the city. </seg>
<seg id="864"> The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens. </seg>
<seg id="865"> The city has appealed its conclusions and its remedial orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The Court of appeal heard Tuesday arguments on the request for a stay. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The appellate court said that the judge had to be relinquished jurisdiction folder because it has violated the code of judicial conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticism of the Court. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The judge ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black men and Hispanic under their control and search program. </seg>
<seg id="869"> It has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including reform of policies, training and supervision, and she ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the districts where the largest number of controls take place. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In August, New York City has agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping names and addresses of persons whose case is dismissed after a police control. </seg>
<seg id="871"> The hearing of the appeal of the city should be held after March 14, 2014. </seg>
<seg id="872"> The tactical control and the search has been criticized by many civil rights advocates. </seg>
<seg id="873"> This system of control and search existed for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls increased dramatically under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that were mainly focused on black men and Hispanic. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Legal action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Proponents advocating changes in the program and control the NYPD search say they will put an end to unfair practices, will provide police forces more effective and which have trusted, and can change the way police departments make use of policy. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the broader forces of police under pressure problem after police numbers have been greatly reduced over the past decade. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The judge noted that it was not end practices control and search, that are constitutional, but it reformed the way the NYPD was implementing its controls. </seg>
<seg id="878"> The NSA revelations increase the paranoia of businesses with regard to the monitoring of State </seg>
<seg id="879"> A beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of the Germany. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Order of the federal Office for protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of information German, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost located within 5 km of the Central Bank European and the Bundesbank. </seg>
<seg id="881"> German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of antennas to listen and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="882"> James Clapper, the Director of U.S. intelligence services, insisted again in September on the fact that the United States do not use their foreign intelligence capacity to &quot;steal industrial secrets from foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. </seg>
<seg id="883"> But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who became consultant, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure trove of information on the secrets of the supervision of the United States, European Governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the Director on floor. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US providers of storage in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused the paranoia of businesses with regard to the monitoring of State. </seg>
<seg id="885"> The revelation that the phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, maybe even for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel. </seg>
<seg id="886"> If the most powerful person in Europe can be referred, then business leaders are surely also potential targets. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Snowden made transparent the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses. </seg>
<seg id="888"> I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest. </seg>
<seg id="889"> &quot;The Germany needs to wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the it sector. </seg>
<seg id="890"> The German companies think that the United States pose a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy EY. </seg>
<seg id="891"> However, in documents released by Mr. Snowden, no indication to date that the United States have passed secrets to foreign businesses to U.S. companies. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Politicians have expressed their concern to the idea that the EU lacks computer capabilities and sufficient Internet and think that it should endeavour to reduce its dependency on the United States. </seg>
<seg id="893"> Business leaders are skeptical on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="894"> A member of the German Parliament said that we should create a German Google. </seg>
<seg id="895"> I cannot close the eyes and reopen them slowly... </seg>
<seg id="896"> &quot;This is not the right way to do&quot;, said Hasso Plattner, president of the society of German enterprise software, SAP. </seg>
<seg id="897"> If we wanted a strong European industry, then we must not starve it 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Everything is subsidized in Germany, coal cars, passing by the farmers. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Everything except the it industry. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Yet, the scale and sophistication of the U.S. exposed by the revelations of Snowden spy agencies were a shock for some companies who thought until then that China represented the greatest risk in terms of monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="901"> A big change is happening in cloud computing because European leaders have become aware of the fact that the data stored in the United States are governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="902"> According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, about 10% of the non-American members gave up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cloud after the revelations about the American Prism data mining program. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Jim Snabe, Co-Director of SAP, says: &quot;our customers today ask us a question that they did not pose a year ago: where my data are kept and can you assure me they will physically remain in this Court? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="904"> Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they knew already, namely that powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs. </seg>
<seg id="905"> It is not surprising that there is economic espionage. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Is always there. </seg>
<seg id="907"> &quot;This is a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion,&quot; said Kurt Bock, Director-general of the BASF chemical company. </seg>
<seg id="908"> Americans spy us on the commercial and industrial map as we eavesdropping, as it is in the national interest to defend our businesses. </seg>
<seg id="909"> Corporate executives are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would allow the advantage to an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Large corporations hammer the message that it is for the less foolhardy to retrieve a free USB key at a tradeshow or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="911"> Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Directors of the German automobile manufacturer Audi, said the collection of mobile phones before the meetings of the Council, so that they can not be used as a remote listening devices, is a common practice for many years. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The BfV of Germany advises its officers to consider use of simple mobile phones prepaid when traveling abroad due to the risk of harm to the integrity of the smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Prepaid phones are then thrown. </seg>
<seg id="914"> However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="915"> In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="916"> &quot;SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their secrets against unauthorized access&quot;, warns the BfV in a report. </seg>
<seg id="917"> The United States alert their own companies on the economic espionage activities by other countries. </seg>
<seg id="918"> The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) realise made in February by the United States, cited France, along with Russia and Israel, guilty to second-degree have performed acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="919"> A member of the Board of Directors of a renowned German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Bernard Squarcini, former Director of french domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: &quot;the services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> A tax on real estate foreign owners to burst the bubble of London </seg>
<seg id="922"> Treasury has provisionally costed the measure of the tax on capital gains but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne that the 2012 budget, included a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than 2 M£ and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold properties in a society rather than as individuals. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The stamp duty already applicable to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea and represents 708 M£ on fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of the Ireland of the North, the country of Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and the Yorkshire region and Humber gathered. </seg>
<seg id="924"> Mr Cook said: &quot;following the increase in the stamp duty on properties of high value and the introduction of law anti-avoidance rule in the matter, it very difficult to move forward that valuable properties are sous-imposées regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="925"> &quot;But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners reluctant to the idea of selling,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="926"> The real estate - the 5 to 10% of the price the highest in the real estate market - in the prosperous area southwest of London that stretches from Fulham at Wimbledon, has increased a record percentage of 11.8% over the last year. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Prices in Central London show steady growth from year to year by 5.6% but have been overshadowed by an &apos;internal market&apos; growing southwest of the city, Northern (7.4%) and Eastern (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills studies. </seg>

<seg id="950"> Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said &quot;excited&quot; at the prospect of working with the British Government on the project. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway between London and the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="952"> Once Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> In June, the Government has revised upward the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between London and the North of England, from 32.7 Md£ to 42.6 Md£. </seg>
<seg id="954"> The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity strengthening and improvement of the length of the trips to the North of England and Scotland. </seg>
<seg id="955"> This should include the opportunity to journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh for three hours at most. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The Baroness Kramer said: &quot;our goal for HS2 door on a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="957"> We push the HS2 project because the advantages are huge. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Without him, we are facing a problem of our rail network capacity. </seg>
<seg id="959"> But it is also to develop connectivity between 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that between them are best thanks HS2. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, said: &quot;today&apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="961"> The Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support &apos;unequivocal&apos; inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Mr Brown said: &quot;high-speed rail has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to Scotland, but he also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network in Britain. </seg>
<seg id="963"> &quot;We are so excited at the idea of working in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the train network at high speed to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already being planned. </seg>
<seg id="964"> &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to read the report with British Ministers next year and we will then decide together the next steps.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="965"> The United Nations welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty </seg>
<seg id="966"> The United Nations will start now to work on a new set of targets to replace the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to fight against poverty in the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> Australian diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the &apos;sustainable development objectives&quot;to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on sustainable development that began the previous day in Rio de Janeiro. </seg>
<seg id="968"> They were included in the final draft of the document, to be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the Summit. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the Summit that it was now time to &quot;exceed national interests.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="973"> Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate sex.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="974"> The Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="975"> Sex male or female of newborns will longer assigned, rigidly at birth to them. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter a sex &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;not specified&quot; on his birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure weighing on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against the intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="978"> According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="979"> I will remain patchwork created doctors, bruised and scarred. </seg>
<seg id="980"> It is estimated that a child on 2,000 born each year, is a boy or a girl. </seg>
<seg id="981"> They are intersex, intersex forming part of the Group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosomes or atypical gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Wallis Simpson could be intersex. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and issues of sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law &quot;seems to be a good idea. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma. </seg>
<seg id="986"> &quot;Some people suffer from diseases extremely serious requiring surgery, but this is not the case for most children,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="987"> It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops. </seg>
<seg id="988"> The science that is how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise. </seg>
<seg id="989"> No one can answer the question about why this happens. </seg>
<seg id="990"> It&apos;s like the mystery surrounding homosexual persons. </seg>
<seg id="991"> A report submitted to the Commission European 2011 described transgender, and intersex people as different from transgender people since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as being one or the other. </seg>
<seg id="992"> These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones. </seg>
<seg id="993"> The report also gave an overview of the discrimination which were faced by intersex people and transgender people in employment, as well as the scale of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Young boys of non-compliant kind now have camps specially intended for them. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The Australia and the Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; on their official documents. </seg>
<seg id="996"> In June, an Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized &quot;neutral&quot; after winning his appeal hearing which allows it to keep a sex &quot;not specified&quot; to life. </seg>
<seg id="997"> German passports will contain a third designation next to M or F - X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id="998"> In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24. </seg>
<seg id="999"> In 2011, dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country have signed a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; be removed from school books. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> The American site Catholic Online also objected to the German law, writing that &quot;since the world is dragged into a new reign where the genre is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, it reverses two other pillars of civilization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1001"> In Maryland, the mother of an infant has also reported on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex is assigned to babies at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> &quot;Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child&quot;, she said the site aimed at young parents. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> Children need stability and certainty. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, named the magnificent Greek God who had a dual sex. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> And a decade ago, the medical community considered the genus as a slate, which can be clear and on which we can redraw. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> But now, many are those who call into question the ethical basis of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his gender reassignment when it will grow. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> &quot;In the middle of 20th century, called this a psychiatric emergency&quot;, reported Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> When these children were born, it was not called the psychiatrist, it phoned the surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of the Johns Hopkins University, who considered that the genre is malleable. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> He spent the term &apos;sexual identity&apos; and argued that social and environmental signals - how parents raise a child - interact with genes and hormones of a child to shape so that it be identified as male or female. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> But in a case of 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan&quot;, his theories have given rise to controversy. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> It had recommended that the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a circumcision sloppy to castrate entirely, also removing the testicles, and raise him as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> &quot;Money has presented this as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> At the age of about 15 years, he became a boy and is married to a woman. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> But at age 38, he committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Drescher said that some doctors &quot;always repeating this model. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> But in the years 1990, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say &apos;[that] they are not satisfied with the result. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a writer of 36 years of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY but ambiguous sexual organs. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or small penis and were convinced that he could never have a &apos;good life&apos; as a man. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> So shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical removal of the external body and the testicles and was raised as a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> It has been taking female hormones at the age of 12 years. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> &quot;I knew that I was not a girl&quot;, he said on ABCNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> I wasn&apos;t happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> At age 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical records. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> What he discovered horrified him. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> I have been sterilized at birth - and nobody had ever tell me. </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body to produce enough testosterone to keep his sexual organs develop. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> After learning the truth, he became a man, following treatment with testosterone and is made remove the breasts. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The surgery made him sterile. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to standardize the perception of intersex people. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, feared that the German law &quot;invites labelling and stigmatization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> &quot;Many activists worry that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an&quot;indeterminate&quot;sex&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> We are afraid that it is encouraging interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> We believe that it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> But we have not seen that the law would give, so we can only speculate. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> &quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind&quot;, she added. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The German law for the allocation of the sex at birth. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> This is not a battle that young children should lead to this age there. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> But Dr. Arlene Baratz, radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German Act &quot;empower&quot; parents and children. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Due to the failure of its androgen receptor, Katie has developed feminine characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Today 29 year old Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or of surrogate mothers. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot;The Statute leaves flexibility to parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions&quot;, said Baratz. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> This leaves them time to do some tests and to understand, and a delay before entering &apos;male&apos; or &apos;female &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> Thus, everything&apos;s okay - you can raise your child and loving it. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the fun of being a parent. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> You do not rush you to a surgery that is irreversible. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> &quot;This places children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what it takes,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> Finally, the child will decide with what sex it feels the most uncomfortable - and this is something great. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> This allows the child to make the decision for himself. </seg>

<seg id="1061"> The cry of despair of a voter for Obama </seg>
<seg id="1062"> I voted twice for president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change </seg>
<seg id="1063"> He said that Obama had made commendable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican party </seg>
<seg id="1064"> Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare, or drone attacks site </seg>
<seg id="1065"> The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year of medicine at Harvard Medical School. </seg>
<seg id="1067"> I am trying to read a terribly sad book these days. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and means me hope. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> It is called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and it&apos;s the memoirs of Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> When I finished my patients medical reports at night and I go to bed, this book next me to the time where policies inspired millions of people and where speeches could breath. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> The election ended with a landslide victory and the newspapers of news presenters have taken the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> My classmates have cried with joy and my parents have retained all the logs they found. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> During the period of transition from Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82 percent of favourable opinions. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> And then I close the book. </seg>
<seg id="1076"> Return to the present is a rude awakening, as out of a dream. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> It is hard to remember these days full of optimism, they are as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> The change really occurred in the years that followed the first time where I voted. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> It had nothing to do with what I had imagined. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> I put to the credit of Obama&apos;s great achievements, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (affordable care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of &apos;neither seen nor known&quot;and the assassination of Osama bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts aimed at advancing our nation in the area of reforms of immigration, care of public health and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> But after having repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can&apos;t any more to provide explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> I am on the edge of political despair. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> It can not explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor indicted whistleblowers who reveal the misdeeds of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> It cannot justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor escape from public funding and the overspending during the presidential campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="1087"> It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that said that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence were the &quot;most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> I do not know if it is what I expected. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> If, at age 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the political opposition party and events that occur by chance, such as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> However, all the examples I listed above appear to be largely the choice of the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> This is what bothers me the most. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> I vote again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Mitt Romney had a confused and little refined alternative that seemed not to determine its policies or its positions. </seg>
<seg id="1096"> I felt that Obama, elected for a second term in being released from the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises which they heard for so long. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Yet, then the index of favourable opinions has dipped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> It makes me wish the many promises which have soared. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> At a meeting of post-campaign, he said his team need to bounce back on track and remain loyal to their cause. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> &quot;I want that we focus on our talent&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> We have to remember who we are. </seg>

<seg id="1119"> Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its division market exchange according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of manipulation of the currency market begins to bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the regulators in the context of the investigations into the most important financial market in the world, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> Two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of enlargement of the survey, which echoed the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> The Bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed earlier this month have received requests for information from regulators. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> &quot;The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators&quot;, said a representative of the Bank two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had sent folders of emails and instant messages sent and by a former trader at the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European Manager of trading spot currencies at JPMorgan. </seg>
<seg id="1126"> Rohan Ramchandani, European Manager of the trading of foreign exchange cash at Citi, has been placed on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior trader of currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> None of these traders has been the subject of no charge. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> The record of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent and by bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, have added some sources close to the case. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> UBS said this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the Forex market in a number of Swiss banks. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the competition authority Swiss Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - examine the allegations made concerning bankers would be agreed to manipulate rates on the Forex market. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also launched investigations internal or received requests for information from regulators, said sources close to the case. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Banks skin instant messages and emails sent for years to find any cases of wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> News concerning these investigations have shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth of the units of trading of investment in recent years banks, but who gave in question this year due to the low volatility currency that limits opportunities for speculators. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but the senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> A senior trader said that despite the high daily change, fragmentation transaction volume of liquidity between management platforms exchanges and use more more frequent by the banks of their own internal platforms &apos;explains it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at cheap. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> The news came the same day where Credit Switzerland announced referred a trader working in his office at the London Stock Exchange traded funds this week after he caused a loss of 6 M$ at the end of last year. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> The Bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators. </seg>

<seg id="1140"> A Chinese newspaper which launched an appeal on the front page for the release of a journalist charged with libel will be redrafted, says the press regulator. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> The New Express based in Guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> But Mr. Chen has subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Now, the New Express will undergo a &quot;complete overhaul&quot;, said the regulator. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The order of &quot;realignment&quot; emanates from the administration of Guangdong for the press and publishing, Radio, Film and Television. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned in the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several erroneous blogs on Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1146"> &quot;The drafting of New Express was disorganized,&quot; the regulator said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> He said that he had decided &quot;to impose a penalty of an administrative nature to Chen Yongzhou pulling his press card&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1150"> After his arrest, his newspaper published two times a call on first page for his release, writing that he supported his journalism. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted having published false stories for money. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> &quot;In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public&quot;, he told the public television network CCTV. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> I did it mostly because I was running after money and fame. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> I realized my mistake. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Following the apology from Mr. Chen, New Express issued his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked articles. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> The experts say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law which was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to incriminating himself. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> Is Obama walks back on its reform of the health system </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Under a barrage of criticism, president Obama returned yesterday to clear and oft-repeated promise that &quot;If you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their service providers, Republicans criticized the president during the last days in accusing him of deceiving the American people. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Yesterday, Barack Obama has adjusted his original promise. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> &quot;The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,&quot; he said to a speech in Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Speaking of what he calls «an effervescence in the news» about terminations, president Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance on the market. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Most people will be able to obtain complete and more responsive health plans for the same price or even cheaper than expected for. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> &quot;You exit winning&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> The Administration announced that it would be surprised if the 5% of the population who get themselves their insurance were forced change of regime as their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> &quot;Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better&quot;, said Kathleen Sebelius during his testimony before the Committee on energy and commerce in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had failed &quot;miserably&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> &quot;I am also frustrated and irritated that anyone&quot;, she added. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> I look forward to regain your confidence. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who delivered this sentence, while she believed his microphone cut, in addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly of yesterday following an exchange of points of view contested with Billy Long, representing Republican Missouri, whether it should join the Obamacare. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> For more than three hours, Billy Long has ceased to ask insistently Ms. Sebelius why &quot;the architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive insurance sponsored by the Government to purchase a system via HealthCare.gov, that it now boasts millions of Americans. </seg>

<seg id="1174"> &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; of the Coen brothers, Grand Prize at the last Festival de Cannes, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and music folk who was just starting to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan. </seg>

<seg id="1181"> Homeless, he toured the sofas of friends who still want to receive it. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> An air of documentary </seg>
<seg id="1183"> &quot;His relationship with success is tortured, that is what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, which is not careerist but integrates with a self-destructive behaviour&quot;, said Ethan Coen, crowned press with his brother Joel&apos;s numerous Oscars and awards at Cannes. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> Llewyn Davis has not existed, two filmmakers folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time such as the folk musician Dave Von Ronk. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The idea was to show the time prior to the advent of Greenwich village, this area of New York called to become &quot;the epicenter of the boom of folk music which would create international stars&quot; as wrote the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> The film then takes like a documentary, dusty music label invaded 33 unsold t inhabited by an old priceless Secretary, musical choices from the studios of the time and cafes where singers occurred. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> The Coen brothers magic again by integrating a funny character who runs through the film constantly: a magnificent red cat to look cute, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis. </seg>

<seg id="1190"> For Justin Timberlake, the work is needed to &quot;be seen as good&quot;, &quot;random may also launch the careers of someone&quot;, and &quot;more and more today&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star says in a career, &quot;the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can stop us to express ourselves&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1197"> A major part of the growth in the coming years will come from its projects of LNG in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> Because the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures increased by seven billion dollars in two years and should reach 36.7 billion in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The benefits of production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream (including refining and chemical production) activities have dropped by 45% to $ 380 million. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> This decline in refining margins affects the whole of the sector. </seg>

<seg id="1211"> The NSA spying: United States &quot;gone too far&quot;, admits Kerry </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The United States sometimes gone &quot;too far&quot; espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in the first admission of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA). </seg>
<seg id="1213"> After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, it is the first time that a U.S. Government official explicitly admits practice controversial in the interception by the NSA communications and data in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> &quot;In some cases, I grant you, as did the president, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this happens more in the future&quot;, said John Kerry at a conference in London attended it from Washington Thursday 31 October by video link. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Citing the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that U.S. authorities had since foiled many projects of attacks through the interception of communications and information gathering. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> &quot;We have indeed prevented that planes fall, buildings exploding and people are murdered, because we were able to be the current upstream of these projects,&quot; argued the patron of diplomacy American. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> And, said John Kerry at the address of the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been deceived&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> But we are trying to gather information. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> &quot;And Yes, in some cases, it has gone too far from inappropriately&quot;, yet admitted the Secretary of State, who had already to express themselves on this international scandal during a tour the week last in Paris, London and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> He said Thursday night that president Obama was &quot;resolved to attempt to clarify and conducting a review of these practices so that nobody feels cheated&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> According the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> The newspaper, citing documents obtained from the consultant to the NSA Edward Snowden, said that the programme baptised &quot;MUSCULAR&quot;, and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by the giants of the internet. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Believe one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the single month of January last - metadata on emails from text elements or audio or video documents. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> These interceptions would be held outside the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> But Yahoo and Google have denied any link with these practices. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, have revealed that the NSA had intercepted massively data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> Face the wrath of States Europeans and then leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listens, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, citing national security. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, general Keith Alexander, has denied that its intelligence agency has picked up tens of millions of citizens communications. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services that is would be seized of these communications, before providing them to the NSA. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> This would involve &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would absolutely not be Europe, said general Alexander. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> And the controversy was extended Friday to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> The Indonesia summoned the Ambassador of Australia, which the mission is charged to be used by the Americans as part of an extensive network of international espionage that has also attracted the ire of China. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Precocious puberty: ageing earlier </seg>
<seg id="1236"> Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Nothing proves that the hormones or other chemical substances that are responsible for </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger of precocious puberty </seg>
<seg id="1240"> The trend toward precocious puberty is not as pronounced in boys </seg>
<seg id="1241"> The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family issues and health in children. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Should a mother worry about if breasts and pubic hair of his daughter begin to push to 7 or 8 years? </seg>
<seg id="1243"> At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which took place this week in Orlando, Fla., the Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American youth and represent a new standard. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> &quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Obvious signs of development, such as the budding of breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odor, appear earlier in girls. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> But it was only a slight advance of the age of the first rules during the last four decades. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while 12-year-old three quarters in 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> &quot;Once that chest began to grow, it must be at least two or three years until the first rules appear,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The time is the test most accurate for how will evolve puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> There is a debate regarding what constitutes the real onset of puberty, but it is considered &apos;early&apos; where the development of the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 years. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In most cases, development slows down or stops - this is something that a pediatrician can follow closely. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> A more rapid evolution can justify the tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> There are treatments to delay the onset of menarche and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can curb the growth and a small size at adulthood. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> Drug and hormone treatment recommendations are based on the age of the child, development rate, the rate of growth and emotional maturity. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Psychosocial aspects are also important. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that &quot;control puberty can alleviate some behavior problems and feel for young girls to be different from the others. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> The other big problem is understandable: parents want simply that their very young girls have their rules. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> &quot;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they are going to handle hygiene issues,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> &quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter had her menarche at age 10. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not prepared emotionally. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> She returned from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are many theories brought to the knowledge of the public about the causes of early puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible for. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> The boys as girls reach puberty earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> He participated in a study on girls between the ages of 6 to 9 years that binds the percentage of body fat to the onset of puberty. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> There are various explanations. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Globally, mechanisms of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by any economic climate conditions, passing through genes. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Another problem: Although males have hairs on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards a true precocious puberty is not as pronounced among girls. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Other doctors attending the conference of the PAA stressed the complexity of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> &quot;We must be careful as to how we identify the real onset of puberty&quot;, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinologist pedo working at the hospital for children Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> &quot;This can mean having a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; Kaplowitz said. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> If you stay calm, your child will react well in general. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured on the fact that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life. </seg>

<seg id="1298"> He told me &quot;it is released&quot;, but I am not sure, and tell me that can still be killed. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> We are very excited, but very tense. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> They lay down on the edge of a sidewalk. </seg>

<seg id="1308"> I also remember a short night to chat with Roger and Mr Marchiani. </seg>

<seg id="1316"> And lots of media. </seg>

<seg id="1334"> It is part of the process. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> I also met the intelligence services. </seg>

<seg id="1343"> I try to separate things between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap of Président de l&apos;Association &quot;Hostages of the world&quot; which lets me put the distance, and seems much more interesting to discuss. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> I wonder for example about the definition of resilience. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Above all, I fight, with others, to recognition of the legal status of the hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> I think there is a problem of semantics. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> We must qualify hostage &quot;political&quot; hostage - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Today, once more, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> But who says that the hostages might also have access to justice? </seg>
<seg id="1350"> A court in the Hague is made for that. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Why would we not say to hostage-takers &quot;you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we&apos;ll bring you to justice&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1352"> It seems to me yet based, legitimate, common sense hit. </seg>

<seg id="1381"> The rodent control company makes two crossings per year, and in addition, we operate, our support each application of the inhabitants. </seg>

<seg id="1394"> Another day, another disturbing story about independence. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> This time, it warns that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian&apos;s wall. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> While it is true that the journal of Strathclyde indicated possible spin-off economic freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not yet included in the headlines (and expected). </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Nobody also said that EU Member States spend much of their time to work around their formal rules when it suits them. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything that she wants to get Scots. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> So it&apos;s a story that is not a. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> And if history it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the canard that &quot;independence means the passport control&quot; over 40 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> However, they forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe, in fact? </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Why Exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now? </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Here&apos;s the real news about Europe: the great plan of war to unify Europe is definitely stalled. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> With the crisis of the euro, the European project is officially dead. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Across Europe, the parties opposed to the EU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative to the Germany, founded only this year and come from nowhere, brought together nearly five million votes in the federal election of September and released (equivalent to our Liberal-Democrats) liberal democratic party in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the heavy shackles on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that the European draft went too far. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> The crisis of the euro doesn&apos;t have much to do with national Governments who register excessive budgetary deficits - this was only true for the Greece. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The European system was rather weigh on its exchange rates favorable for German exporters members - that German politicians want to keep. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with a problem of intrinsic productivity against the Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> The only recourse is to make the cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Beyond the fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> Following the &apos;green&apos; energy policies imposed by Brussels - which is a reason to subsidize the French and German companies of the energy at the expense of the consumer sector - European industry pay twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> This is a prohibitive in terms of cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> All gels of salaries in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a cheap American shale gas. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Accordingly, the revolt rumbles, particularly in France, one of the major leaders of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control the Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> But Berlin has more need of Paris as passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy undermined struggling. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> Result: Marine Le Pen&apos;s far-right party, the National Front anti-European, has won a critical by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning for the labour party British, who reminds him that he cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically promote the left. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> What is Marine Le Pen with its new popularity among the white working class French? </seg>
<seg id="1426"> She wants to use the European elections of the year next to create a unique and anti-European anti-monnaie the European Parliament block. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European sentiment and single anti-monnaie in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like «Europe of Nations (sovereign)» free preferred by General de Gaulle. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> The Germany and some of its satellites economies could keep the euro, but the France and southern Europe meet their own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> I expect that the United Kingdom should take away from this project, and I hope he will sweet eyes in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> And Scotland, in all this? </seg>
<seg id="1434"> We can decide to be a region of little England (essentially). </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending walk Berlin and Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European Agreement provided that we retain our own currency. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non federal Europe of Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> Otherwise, we should imitate the Norway and maintain our economic independence. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> The SNP Scottish Government is - and it is worth noting - the movement political anti-austerite which was the most successful in Europe, since he won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer labour, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition that followed. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels. </seg>

<seg id="1507"> The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The explosion of a dwelling in Gesves, which injured two serious Friday morning, a grandmother of 52 years and his 5-year-old grandson, is due to leakage of gas from a defective water heater, said Friday night the substitute of the Procurator of the King. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> The expert dispatched on-site by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> Grandma lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Life-threatening of the two victims is still committed. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and was seriously burned. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and more slightly burned. </seg>

<seg id="1519"> Crisnée preparedness stabilised both buildings. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> A black box in your car? </seg>
<seg id="1521"> Then the planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find the money needed to repair highway infrastructure in disrepair, there are many who see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above the dashboard of your car. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Devices which record all miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of an attempted controversial in Washington and Government offices of planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing of the main U.S. routes. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> The sector generally uninteresting of the main planning suddenly caused a very lively debate and eventful alliances. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Libertarians have joined with environmental groups to exert pressure so that the Government uses small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and road on which you are possibly, and then use the information to write a tax bill. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The Tea Party is appalled. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern regarding the protection of privacy. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And while members of Congress fail to reach agreement on whether to continue, several States have not waited. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> They look how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles traveled. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> Thousands of motorists have already boarded these boxes black, sometimes equipped with a monitoring system by GPS, for an experimental excursion. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> This is really essential for our nation. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;It is not as if we had a choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State began recording the miles traveled by every California motorist by 2025. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> There will be change in the way we pay these taxes. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> The technology is there to do. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> The pressure comes as the Highway Trust Fund in the country, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Americans buy more as much gasoline as before. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Cars can travel more miles a gallon. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Tax Federal itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;The gas tax is simply tenable step&quot;, said Lee Munnich, a policy specialist from the University of Minnesota transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> His State was recently installing tracer on 500 cars to test a payment system to the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> &quot;This is be the most logical alternative to long term&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Wonks call it use to mileage charges. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> Not surprisingly, the idea to seduce the urban Liberals, since the taxes could be used to change driving habits to help reduce congestion and emissions of gas, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the ambitious laws of the State on global warming. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But Congressman Bill Shuster (R - PA.), Chairman of the House of representatives Transportation Committee, said that he considered as the most viable alternative in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Proponents of the free market of the Reason Foundation also enjoy the idea of charging drivers to the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> &quot;It is not just a tax funnels into a big black hole&quot;, said Adrian Moore, Vice President of policy at the Reason Foundation. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> People pay more directly for the benefits that have purchased them. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The movement is also supported by two former Secretaries Americans to transport which, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the route of payment at the mile. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The US Senate has approved a pilot project of 90 M$ last year which would have covered about 10,000 cars. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> But the speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to their work or in town. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Several States and cities are nonetheless making progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the most important experience of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> These motorists will soon pay the State&apos;s mileage fees instead of taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Nevada has already completed a pilot project. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> New York City is considering one. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how to implement the change. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The concept is not a universal success. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> In Nevada, where approximately 50 voluntary motorists have recently equipped their car for a device, drivers were worried that the Government could follow their smallest deeds and gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> &quot;Concerns about Big Brother and what kind of things are a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management in the Department of the transportation of Nevada. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> This is not something that people want. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> From the beginning of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged Locator devices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1564"> It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technology infrastructure which will be inevitably expanded to keep the records of the comings and goings everyday people. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Nevada is one of the few States that are now struggling to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles through a car, but without knowing the location nor the exact time. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> If we can do that, said Khan, the citizens will be more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> This technology research has led some State agencies to appeal to a small start-up from California by the name of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> Originally, the company was not training to help motorists who pay taxes to the States. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> She was looking to break into the emerging market for auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But the devices that it tests liked the main planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically uploaded by modem. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;People will be more likely to do this if you do not register their speed and do not locate them,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Big mistakes have been made in some States pilot programmes. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> There are much cheaper ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> In Oregon, planners are trying to experience by offering motorists different choices. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> They can choose a device with or without GPS. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> They can still choose to have no camera at all, preferring instead to pay a fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Other States are hoping to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxation device that would be equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance &quot;payment to the conduct&quot; and create a set of data on the speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> &quot;Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the advantages offered by the system&quot;, said a document on urban planning. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> However, some transportation planners are wondering if the entire debate on the payment to the mile is not just a huge diversion. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> In the San Francisco Bay area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say that Congress could easily manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> A single or annual tax additional could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume lots of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;It is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when you simply need aspirin&quot;, said Randy Rentschler, Director of legislation and public affairs with the commission. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> If it did that, hundreds of millions of motorists will care of the protection of their privacy and a bunch of other things. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> British police issued a warrant for extradition against Assange </seg>
<seg id="1586"> The British police today issued a warrant for extradition against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for political asylum. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Scotland Yard said that it had issued a &quot;notice of delivery&apos; against the Australian&apos;s 40 years, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible routes under the British act after the supreme Court invalidated it has appeal against his extradition earlier this month. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Fearing that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum to this South American country. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Scotland Yard has &quot;issued a notice of delivery against a 40-year-old man asking him to report to a police station, on the date and time of his choice&quot;, said a spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> It continues to breach the terms of his release on bail. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Assange fears to be extradited from the Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting the secret information. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Letta confident in the longevity of his Government </seg>
<seg id="1595"> The president of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judge that his Government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to deprive Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, said centre-left leader firmly they &quot;intend&quot; to continue to govern with its coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> The upper House of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw support for the Government if the Senate, where there are more opponents than supporters, his dismissal. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> But part of his camp, grouped around the national Secretary of the people of freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the Government, as demonstrated by October 2 his refusal to yield to the demands of Berlusconi who wanted already dropping the firm. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For more than a year, everywhere, I can see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people that I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, fees to no end. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In short, slurping without limit of our pockets. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> All money removed by force to taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, it will interfere with not about lavish expenses and maintenance of lame ducks: deficit cultural centre, strong grant to the city of energy, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> If these facilities are not profitable, that we sell them to private enterprise or we demolish them. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> It is sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that never came. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso in a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers? </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Isn&apos;t tiered public to invest in such companies, but rather to the private sector based on the request of the consumer. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Citizens were pleased to learn that the Lakes to fishing and batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Following the departure of all industries (water-intensive) and at the grand decline in population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Without wanting to say to the waste, the city will never starve for water and the severe regulations on its use could be greatly softened. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> In summary, it is easy to do great things with the money of others. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> I would be ashamed to defend such a record. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> With a gross debt of more than 200 million $, this city is not even able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing Bylaw. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> We are managed for more than 40 years of fashion with beautiful diplomas for most and I do not think that a sheep farmer is worse. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> A worker dies buried under concrete blocks </seg>
<seg id="1617"> A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning, in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> The tragedy occurred around 11: 00, on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street in the Borough of Rosemont - La Petite-Patrie. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> In all likelihood, work on the foundations took place at this location for some time. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> A common foundation wall had been erected during the last days. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The accident occurred at the point where the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> I was browsing car and I saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the site. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> I am landed and I went to remove the large bricks that covered it. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> We saw only a part of his back, this is so unfortunate. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> According to the authorities, the victim was an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a company of formwork. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Resuscitation manoeuvres have been attempted by the services of emergency, but without success. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Man has not survived with serious injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> A Commission of health and work safety inspector was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> The NSA involves an &quot;internal error&quot; and hackers for the failure of its site </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The National Security Agency working in the shade said Friday that it was a bug which caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; said spy agency in a statement by email. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> The problem will be solved tonight. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Earlier this evening, servers online trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still not be able to access the site. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the Agency&apos;s sensitive internal network was &quot;not at all&quot; compromised. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> No classified information is in danger, said the spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> At least a group of hacktivists online stated be responsible for the failure of the NSA by DSD attack site. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> DSD attacks aim to flood a target site until the servers are overloaded and that site collapses. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated, and attacks are not intended to penetrate into the internal network of the target system. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Formerly ultra secret NSA, dubbed time &quot;No Such Agency&quot;, is found under the fire of projectors and sharply criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive monitoring programmes presentations nationally and internationally - that are part of the secret files of the stolen from the Agency and disclosed by former NSA disillusioned NSA consultantEdward Snowden. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> This growing controversy around the Agency has caused much speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted operation cyber. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Downtown Delta now closed </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The hotel Delta Centre-Ville has closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> Investment Fund who owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Of these, 200 have not found new employment. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Delta promises not to drop its employees. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Employers have come to meet with employees directly on-site, we met individually employees to assess their needs. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;This support there will continue for the next six months,&quot; said the regional director of the labour relations of Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The closure of Delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> The investment fund who was the owner of this building there were choices to make. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> Either he réinvestissaient in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions so the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have emerged in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> &quot;Or is he was selling it to someone else and that is what has happened&quot;, says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in tourism at the school of sciences of management of UQAM. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Other hotels in Montréal will be also converted in the coming months, as the Crown Plaza, which became a residence for the elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will emerge within two years. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Do you want a neon ice? </seg>
<seg id="1657"> A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world made from jellyfish. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate the brilliant protein chemically. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Chris explains that, since the cream begins to glow when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, more it licks, more it becomes bright. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Charlie, the founder of the society of ice «Lick Me I m Delicious», said: &quot;this is something incredible but we are still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The protein we use in ice reacts with the language at neutral pH. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> So when your mouth warms up the protein, increases the pH level and the ice starts to shine. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> We have tested it in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a special glossy effect. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> It&apos;s probably ice the most expensive that I created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four times more expensive than gold. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Each ball costs me so about £140. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> But it tastes rather good! </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The company to approach experimental Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfumes such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> But his next creation looks even more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> He added: &quot;I would really like to develop an invisible ice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1672"> It is intrinsically impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I&apos;ll find a way to get there. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the Medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> One serious injury in an accident with a ghost on the Brussels ring driver </seg>
<seg id="1675"> A road accident has been one serious injury Friday morning around 5:30 on the inner ring road of Brussels at height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> A driver&apos;s car was struck by a phantom driver, which is free. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00, at the scene of the accident, the time that the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> However, this situation has hardly caused traffic jams because the accident took place in the Hoeilaart exit height. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Therefore, traffic could be diverted by this input/output of the ring. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> A seriously injured child in an attraction in Disneyland Paris </seg>
<seg id="1681"> A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His prognosis is more engaged, but he is still hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> It has been closed until further notice. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Snowden is ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany on the issue of American surveillance </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Edward Snowden, the informant of the US intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Thursday with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> In a letter that the Member has presented to media in Berlin Friday, Mr Snowden said: &quot;Although the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> However, say the truth is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. Government to drop criminal charges against him. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of justice, he was accused of espionage and theft of property of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, said at the Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will be sure to make this possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Relations between the United States and the Germany were strained following complaints that the NSA had bugged the phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign intelligence services, said that had he had a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness &quot;not put in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States&quot;, should enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> M. Ströbele, German Green Member of Parliament, has published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Mr. Ströbele said that, according to counsel for the former consultant of the NSA, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, should give the assurance that it would be &quot;safe&quot; there, said member of Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had a campaign of persecution &quot;serious and sustained&quot; which had forced him to leave his country. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to &apos;my Act of expression policy &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Citizens around the world as well as senior officials - including the United States - have found the revelation of an inexplicable permanent monitoring system utilities. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The letter advance offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of Dolphin to bump off the coast of the northern coasts of the Australia. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible of scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and study of animal and marine environments (OCEAMM) returned to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin you surprised it? </seg>
<seg id="1706"> This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> If in the past, the species have been described and identified based on morphological, anatomical and geographical, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of the classification of the species. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology undermines the classification or the membership of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> At the beginning of the 19th century, the morphologists have classified animals, based on morphological differences between species. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Today, some of these rankings are questioned because of advances in genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> In the same way, morphologically very close species were distinguished through genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> This is the case of the new species that comes to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Ten years ago, the scientific community had recognized two species of this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The recent analysis identified four species. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Why is it a discovery of importance as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society? </seg>
<seg id="1716"> From a conservation perspective, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they knew not that it was part of a new species, this only at this location. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Therefore, if a mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or incidental catch problem occurs in the region, we could deal with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extirpation of a population of a more widespread species on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> A species is considered threatened or endangered on the basis of the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the ability to recover from the neighbouring stocks. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> With regard to the Sousa chinensis species, with the population of the new discovered species originated, its stock automatically became lower, making it more vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> Why is it rare to discover new species of mammals? </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between individuals and populations. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> This mixing of genes limit the creation of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Conversely, firmer ecosystems promote reproductive isolation, which can lead to term the creation of new species. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> You should know that the marine environment is the less well known medium. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, only 11 km from the surface of the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> We spend more money in the search for life on other planets and in marine research and it is high time that this changes. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Clive Palmer argues that the MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> The tycoon of mining, who contests a carbon fee of 6 million $, submitted this argument to try to dismiss questions about a possible conflict. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding if carbon and mining taxes must be removed. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But Mr. Palmer claimed that only Ministers might have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott girls were ready to personally benefit from these policies. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> &quot;It will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to pay parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact whether or not it gets leave,&quot; said Mr. Palmer. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax with 53 votes, after recount. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a reworking of the system of votes remains to accelerate the process. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished? </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We need a better system&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning? </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to paper to mark the ballots. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Is - to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees? </seg>
<seg id="1744"> Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> The Electoral Commission has studied the options in relation to e-voting and recently released a discussion paper with the New Zealand. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Palmer, age 59, has said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that it would take his new role &quot;very seriously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> &quot;We seek no reward, except the reward of history because we serve the community at a critical moment&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> When many equestrian events experts gathered in Cardiff to compete to win the horse of the year trophy, they knew that the competition would be tough. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> But no one expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Not yet in school and only a few months after his debut, the toddler and her pony Shetland Toffee have trotted for three rounds with great ease, and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other adult competitors. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> The two inseparable - that are the same size - have been hailed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank, Rudry equestrian center near Cardiff. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> Posing against men and women in hats elegant melons, he wore his flat Cap slightly on the side of casual way to scroll through his old Toffee pony of 2 years around the track. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural qualities of dressage, unusual for a child of his age. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> And Toffee has received very good grades for his presentation and his personality. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Fenton took Toffee gift for her 3rd birthday in March and trained since with its Shetland pony every day. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> His mother Donna, 30 years, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1758"> They presented themselves and against all, but both won the Gold Cup and rosette. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> It was only the second time that he competed with Toffee and we were overjoyed that he won. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> On the track, people who didn&apos;t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who participate in equestrian contests for more than 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Ms. Howells said: &quot;there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged him and applauded him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> He traveled the length of the track power and even though it seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he dealt with. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> How it started, it will surely participate soon in the manifestation of the horse of the year – and I am sure he will do a great performance. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: &quot;Fenton was only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1767"> They form a good team. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> Judges have noticed that Fenton and Toffee showed well and the way in which they marched on the track. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> They are looking for an effective teamwork between the Pony and the trainer - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> I&apos;m sure that his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, there really look great. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all the soldiers before their return to civilian life. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> Attacked by Liberals and the new Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson has ensured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a plan of transition in collaboration with their superiors. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> All the wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before you are ready, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Critics accuse the Government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured - which do not meet the &quot;universality of service&quot; rule requiring army personnel is able to perform a series of tasks - to reach the qualifying period of 10 years required for retirement benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> They particularly cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay one year more in order to receive a fully indexed pension. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> His case has occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary Committee, last month, that he was pushed towards the exit before being ready because it did not meet the universality of service rule. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Mr. Hawkins said that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but this was totally different as the fact you want to leave the ranks. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> &quot;I told them that I was not ready&quot;, he said in an interview with the Canadian Press Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> I asked for months if there was a way so that I could stay, and they said no. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, army punishment to determine what latitude it can give to the wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks, but who are not combat-capable. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Under current rules, the seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Data presented last year to the Parliament indicate that among the 1218 released for medical reasons, 199 soldiers had not reached the length of service required for retirement benefits. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The liberal critic for Veterans Affairs, Jim Karygiannis, on Wednesday called the reinstatement of corporal Hawkins, while new Democrat Jack Harris called for immediate end to &quot;this shameful practice&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Air raid against military facilities in Syria </seg>
<seg id="1787"> According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered airspace Lebanese Wednesday in early afternoon, but the strikes were held in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> A cargo of short range SA-8 surface-to-air missiles have been targeted and destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> This new raid of aviation of the IDF in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) has been confirmed either by Israel or by the Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The raid happened in circumstances almost identical to that which had taken place on 5 July: at the time, it is also an anonymous US official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aiming this time missiles ground - sea Yakhont, delivered by the Russia in Damascus. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing president Assad to respond. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Life imprisonment for a former Chinese Deputy Governor </seg>
<seg id="1793"> A former Vice-Governor of Jilin province, northeastern China, was sentenced Friday to prison for life for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was alleged to have hit more than 19 million yuan of bribes, reported the official Chinese media. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, has helped companies and responsible for contracts, loans or promotions in Exchange for money or gifts, said the first intermediate court in Beijing on his microblog. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> If the head of State promised that justice would be as uncompromising with the powerful &quot;Tigers&quot; that with the &quot;flies&quot; - officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having referred the highest office within the State. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> But the Government has no intention of reforming the system of combating corruption for example by creating an independent body of the party. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> The benefit of Bombardier on the decline, while shipments and orders for aircraft are receding </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Bombardier Inc., aerospace and rail constructor Canadian, has reported a 15% fall in profit net Thursday, under pressure of a decrease in orders and deliveries of airplanes in the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Bombardier, based in Montreal, nor did flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or any information to determine if the aircraft will meet its ambitious timetable for business commissioning before next September. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> After the maiden flight of the test about a month ago and a half aircraft, he stole only three times, and the question then arose whether the testing phase was on the right track. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Results have not been up to the forecasts and the share price fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered Thursday its rating from &quot;outperformance&quot; to &quot;performance of sector&quot; due to the low potential for increase in the stock market during the next quarter or the next two quarters. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> &quot;Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely party early, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the transportation division&quot;, Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft that the flight test programme progresses. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> However, if no new command is announced in the coming months, we expect that the market will become more skeptical about the program. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family can the Catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> But the number of firm orders for the CSeries is modest so far at height of 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the claims of society concerning energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new airliner. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> At the present time, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Pierre Beaudoin, president and Chief Executive, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before starting commercial operation of the first aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Leaders have also reassured analysts and media Thursday indicating that the programme progressed according to schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> &quot;The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected&quot;, said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that tests on the ground and the software updates were provided during the downtime of the aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Each manufacturer plans differently. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> We decided to proceed with a first flight and a period of update, and this is what we did. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> It happen throughout the flight programme. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, said the company. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first client can do steal a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Bombardier indicated that it was currently assessing the timing of entry into service and provide new information in the coming months. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> &quot;This slow pace of flight tests - although it is apparently consistent with the internal calendar of Bombardier - strengthens our opinion that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015&quot;, said Mr. Doerksen. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&apos;s net income fell to 147 M$, or 8 cents per share, compared to 172 M$, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Revenues declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 Md$. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> Analysts had expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world said that it had delivered 45 planes during the quarter, against 57 a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> NET bookings have fallen to 26 planes, against 83 previously. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The delay in the Aeronautics division accounted for 32.9 Md$ September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;In aviation, results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the General conditions of the market have been disappointing&quot;, said Mr. Beaudoin. </seg>

<seg id="1934"> There is no recipe, instruction to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own. </seg>

<seg id="1940"> This is at least what I thought the day where I found his empty body, tense on this bed of hospital in the wrinkled sheets. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Similarly, his funeral were an icy farewell focused around the meager glow of candles that framed his coffin. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> I thought that it was a party. </seg>

<seg id="1981"> The values that she taught me are still present, although I happen to think how it would I be at any given time. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> It goes same for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and righteousness of mind that was a devout believer. </seg>

<seg id="1985"> My mother passed away nineteen years ago now. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> Dead after talking me on the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that fire alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Then, time has soothed the penalty. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Remained that the lack, this vacuum without response, the need for it, assign me to reassure me in the hollow of its sweetness. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Yet, it is there, silent presence, it is there and looks at me. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Every morning, I see her worried eyes land on me, I see the rings that weigh down his eyes, wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, folds that mark the front day of concern. </seg>

<seg id="1998"> We feel doors and protected in difficult times, the passing of time makes us realize how much she was Chief conductor and we try to stay in the lane that she had charted. </seg>

<seg id="2104"> The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the news de Tahiti newspaper containing information of Radio Australia. </seg>

<seg id="2110"> A Deputy Mayor of the island went to London ask Britain to validate this request. </seg>

<seg id="2125"> Kendrick Johnson, Valdosta in Georgia, was found Jan. 11 stuck in a carpet supported standing behind the bleachers of the gym at his high school. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Lowndes County Sheriff investigators have concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> &quot;They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> They have never thought that he was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the Sheriff. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> &quot;They think that this defies all logic, the laws of physics and common sense,&quot; said Crump. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> They believe that these conclusions were delivered solely to cover the persons responsible for the death of their son. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> &quot;They sent their son to school with a satchel and it rendered it them in a body bag,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> The Attorney of the United States Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Johnson, stressing that several important questions remain unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> What is the cause of death? </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Is his death the result of a criminal act? </seg>
<seg id="2135"> Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> I&apos;ll follow up the facts, wherever they lead. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> My goal is to uncover the truth. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> &quot;I consider that there is a sufficient basis&quot; to open a formal investigation, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from &quot;positional asphyxia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> &quot;Several questions still deserve a response or confirmation&quot;, he said. </seg>

<seg id="2147"> Muller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever found its trace, in fact was buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial to the German resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> Müller did not survive at the end of the war. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> &quot;His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte&quot;, assured the circulation daily in relying on archival documents. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> This revelation, 68 years after the end of the nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would meet one of the greatest enigmas of the post-war period. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> The German secret service, the BND, provided as well as during the summer 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> The secret services were totally mistaken. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> &quot;From August 1945, Müller body was found in a provisional grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a commando&quot;, according to Mr. Tuchel. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> He was wearing &quot;a uniform of general&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> &quot;In the left inside pocket were including its service with a photo States&quot;, he continues. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> Bild also published a document from the Town Hall of the Borough of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> The president of the central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, has expressed shocked at this revelation. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormity of bad taste. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> &quot;It crowd roughly of the foot the memory of the victims&quot;, is out in the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Heinrich Müller is part of important personalities of the Third Reich who were never caught. </seg>

<seg id="2162"> The Egypt asked the first freely elected president to take an oath </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he took the oath of investiture to the Presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Mubarak, who was driven out of power 16 months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> At his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first Islamist president freely elected of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> He lent oath before 18 judges in black dress of the Court building located on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> &quot;We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second Republic&quot;, said president Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> &quot;Today, the Egyptian people has asked the foundations of a new life - the absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability&quot;, explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive Governments. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the Court to cheer the new president, and departing presidential splendour of years Mubarak, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the busy streets connecting downtown to the southern suburbs. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Considered to be the &quot;spare wheel&quot; little charismatic Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech Friday in which he tried to present themselves as the candidate not only Islamists but to all those who want to finish the work begun during the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian president Moubarak. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;The Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,&quot; said Mohamed Morsi, costumed blue and Red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with woodwork where it has lent oath. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his inauguration speech. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> He was officially welcomed by a military band that played the national anthem while he was standing at attention. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> The Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Upon his arrival, he was greeted by singing &quot;the people and the army, hand in hand...&quot;. &quot;intoned by thousands of people gathered in the Auditorium of the University. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of the Islamist student groups in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath Friday in Tahrir square, where the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and has vowed to reclaim the presidential powers of the military Council, which has replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him is gone. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> But in agreeing to officially take an oath before the Court, rather than the Parliament as is customary, he bowed to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The speech of Mr. Morsi on Tahrir square is accompanied by spectacular populist gestures. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> Aircraft manufacturers argue about the width of the seats while big orders are at stake </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The dispute rages between the large aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the class tourist on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow which takes place of months above. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> The conflict focuses on the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights in economy class passengers - who are not always the most courted by the airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiencies in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> This week, Airbus called the aviation industry to put in place a standard requiring a seat with at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) height in the economic classes, but his great American rival Boeing said that it should be for the airlines to decide. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> The dispute broke out as manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul planes, possibly hoping a record of commands at the event which will take place from 17 to 21 November. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The manner in which the seats will be arranged in the back of the plane - in particular, will there be 9 or 10 seats front - is essential for the economic performance of the segment of the «mini-jumbo. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Boeing said that its &apos;777 X&apos; redeveloped to accommodate economy class 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Airbus says that, economy class, the concurrent version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches wide seats configured in rows of 9. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Aeronautics Giants often exchanged blows on technical issues by advertising in the trade press. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Today, Airbus appeal directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777 X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 commands. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Could realize recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against the other at the restaurant, entitled &quot;do you accept it? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2192"> &quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights in closer seats in regional turboprop aircraft&quot;, said John Leahy, Airbus commercial Director. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in the aircraft have not radically changed. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo has defined the modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average U.S. 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of health. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Waist of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Airbus said that its rival clings to a seat concept, which dates from the 1950s, when the circumference of the unit freshly christened &apos;jet set&apos; was closer. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Airbus says it has commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch to the width of the seats level would improve the quality of the sleep of 53%. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus in relation to the width of the seats and asserts that it is not manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the ticket prices and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> He also said that the study shows that cabin experience depends not only on the width seats. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> &quot;This is really to bring flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think should be to carry out their activities&quot;, said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> They do not want to be told what will allow them to be profitable. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> They know their business better than anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> For passengers, it&apos;s more to have some freedom of movement, but for providers, it is more a question that could affect their results. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Behind the dispute lies a race at the controls of planes for a estimated at least 700 Md$ priced at the market in the decades to come, enough to tip the balance of exports American and European. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> As Reuters has indicated for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Airbus and Boeing claim both a yield per seat in their latest models of long-haul twin-engine 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> The performance announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777 X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 of origin scheme set up in rows of 9. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The gain in terms of unit cost is low compared to the appliance configured with 10 seats per row currently in service. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> &quot;Boeing made it to cram more seats and make its more competitive aircraft by reports in our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, Director of passenger comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing 777 suggest that many passengers are pronounced for a denser configuration, which can go with cheaper rates. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;A 18 inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from the commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,&quot; said the expert in interior cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-Chief of Runway Girl Network. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Airbus and Boeing are not seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Aircraft sellers who are around the world take even with them a meter to check competing configurations. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> While is claiming to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircraft configurations with high density to companies low-cost airlines and regional travel. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Until recently, Airbus underlined the need for greater customization of booths offering wider seats aisle on some of its aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Without the support of the only other large manufacturer of large modern equipment, experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the industry to put in place a standard size for seats will succeed, but that he could forget the wave of sales of 777 X. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot&apos;s novel adaptation boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a careful reconstruction of time, but it is also more laborious as it should be. </seg>

<seg id="2221"> The film never poured into the lubricity or sensationalism, and it is the problem. </seg>

<seg id="2226"> It is a revolution: the musical French asserts itself as a successful genre. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> Long, Notre Dame de Paris to Mozart opera rock, most of the attempts are entangled in ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> And successes such as Cabaret and Les Misérables wore the Halo of mystery. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage­ ­Entertainment at Mogador has changed the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> Today, these two scenes handle titles such as tubes to success. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The first resumes, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announcement for the following the world premiere of &quot;An American in Paris&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> At Mogador, &quot;La Belle et la bête&quot; could well be one of the hits of the season. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> On other stages, the music shows like &quot;1789&quot;, &apos;lovers of the Bastille&apos; and small musicals such as &quot;Disco&quot; or &quot;Life and Times&quot; are the diapason of success and quality. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book &apos;Stories of musicals&apos; and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> How do evolve French musicals? </seg>
<seg id="2236"> The offer is threader. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> There&apos;s first &quot;musical performances&quot; evolving at the discretion of producers... </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Some use of ­belles projections of images and a ­veritable story as in 1789, the Bastille lovers. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Others make a leap of fifteen back on the pretext that can serve about ­n&apos; anything when you have Matt ­Pokora headlining. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Afterwards, there are musicals with the sumptuous du Châtelet ­productions that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the world of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living ­compositeur. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Internship ­Entertainment popularized Anglo-Saxon variety musicals adapting them in french. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The independent french ­producteurs try a ­percee. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> But ongoing projects such as &quot;Rent,&quot; &quot;The kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; or &quot;The awakening of the ­printemps&quot; are struggling to be funded. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Do we have enough artists capable as at Broadway singer, play and dance? </seg>
<seg id="2245"> In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it&apos;s a great year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> We have 200 talented artists who are turning projects into projects. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The United States, birthplace of the musical, it is very different. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Jobs are plentiful between regional, touring theatres, Broadway and off-Broadway... </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Talent is also so that the number of positions to be filled. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Why the tours in the province have as successful? </seg>
<seg id="2252"> With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relation of culture in France. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Little plays toured and is often the Théâtre de boulevard intended for adults and not young adults. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Musical performances fill this ­manque. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> These same young who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars are... </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Offer beautiful young (often talented) men headlining a musical, it is the assurance of a craze of these girls and their whole family often. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> These shows Facebook pages are carefully ­tenues by professionals who answer questions. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith of province. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> Mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and tasted by the provincials. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The show is designed to enter all the halls of France in the same form as in Paris. </seg>

<seg id="2266"> Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker </seg>
<seg id="2267"> You could say that New York City is the place where was born the stand-up in America: nearly 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly before the public, in the tone of the conversation. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The innovation of Fay is perpetuated over the years, to be taken up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of stand-up Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and the major theaters. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> &quot;Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were a great success, until they became too famous for playing in a club,&quot; said Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> We have created this festival to be able to continue to work with them. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> This year&apos;s event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of &quot;Stand Up for Heroes&quot;, an evening of comedy and music for the benefit of veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby. </seg>

<seg id="2276"> Jenny Slate participated in the show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and was part of the cast of the series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, but it is however best known for his series of videos viral &apos;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors to the singular voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate for racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products the world decentralized American comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> One of the main factors of attraction of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Steinberg started as a stand up comedian, but he became a film director and Director of accomplished television, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> The venue takes place at City Hall, in downtown Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> &quot;The city is definitely in comic DNA of all the work of Larry,&quot; said Steinberg. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He told me that when he was here, sometimes it down an alley between two buildings and said well, if I lose all my money, maybe I will come live here. </seg>

<seg id="2286"> U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the secret passages the most sophisticated that they had never seen. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> The tunnel, zigzagging on a length equivalent to nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which allows to easily conceal drug loaded trucks. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The tunnel has been closed before the drugs not to be emerged passing unnoticed, said the authorities. </seg>

<seg id="2298"> The Syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with poisonous gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring body Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the North of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> The announcement of the Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day in advance on the date limit of </seg>
<seg id="2301"> 1 November set by the organization based in the Hague ordering damask &quot;make unusable&quot; or destroy all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing the toxic gas and fill the ammunition. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> The completion of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable aimed at destroying chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, the Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of weapons and the existing reserves. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of products and chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the agent nerve agent sarin. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> The announcement was made while the fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, who, according to experts, is home to a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory of the rights of man based in Britain. </seg>

<seg id="2311"> On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> It has not updated that number since. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Some 2 million people were forced to flee the country because of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The troops of Al-Assad are fighting against the rebels, many of whom are linked to the Al-Qaida network groups, Safira for weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The fighting have stressed the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors while they must complete their mission, which is to rid the Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues under tight deadlines. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> A statement by the OPCW, which works in close collaboration with the United Nations, indicated that his team was &quot;now satisfied of having checked - and saw destroyed - all critical production declared and machines for the mixing and filling. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> It added that &quot;no other activity inspection was planned at the moment.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2321"> Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to the Syria, &quot;abandoned and... elements of the chemical weapon programme contained therein had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> It was difficult to know at first glance if the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> The Syria submitted a total destruction of its chemical weapons plan which approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> &quot;I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; said the Director general of the Organization Ahmet Üzümcü, in a commentary published by the OPCW. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposed the Sunni Muslim rebels at the Al-Assad Government and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the sect of Alawites, a branch of Shiite islam. </seg>

<seg id="2328"> Two employees of the YMCA accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Two employees of the YMCA of new - South Wales have been accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on sexual abuse of children. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> But in his statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that he &quot;never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> The Director general Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee has been charged with offences relating to child pornography and a physical education YMCA Caringbah Hall monitor has been recognized guilty of sexual assaults on children in the centre where he worked in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that it had been aware of the first case but that it was not aware of the second. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> He also admitted that the opening of the YMCA statement was inaccurate highlighting, external controls of the YMCA conducted and indicated that the safety of the children was a priority for the organization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It has been shown before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed he had received second worst assessments of four schools during an audit of the Department of Education and quality made Communities in August of this year. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21 years, admitted that the personnel management has been a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to check that employees knew that they were required to report any violation of child safety policy. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys for two years where he worked at the YMCA. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> He was sentenced to a 6-year minimum prison sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> But Mr. Hare has rejected the idea that the YMCA would be a cultural problem preventing staff pointed out the failings of Lord towards the safety of the children. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, them was sitting on his knees, told them that he loved and left to play with his cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Danielle Ockwell, which was framed by Lord and who had requested training for the protection of children because it was worried about his behavior, said she found the head of services to the childhood of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who oversaw Lord &quot;very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2341"> The Director general said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report those breaches to their superior hierarchical. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Instead, he said that friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, which is that they have not reported his actions. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views to the Board of the YMCA of new - South Wales saying that, for the Organization, the lesson learned from the &quot;incident&quot; Jonathan Lord should not be &quot;reporting&quot; by staff, and the Board had agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Mr. Hare has said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by Executive Director of the YMCA responsible for services to children, Liam Whitley. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> He said that this decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but that it was an &quot;excess of zeal&quot; and that it had been poorly implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> The YMCA of South new Wales was not a safe Organization for children at the time where Jonathan Lord there was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone at Griffith University told the Committee. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> He said that there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The hearing was adjourned until December 20th. </seg>

<seg id="2350"> The crematorium in Père Lachaise organizes, at 1100 hours, a secular ceremony, in memory of all deceased crematises in his establishment, during the year. </seg>

<seg id="2352"> To follow the ceremony, click above. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> For their own funeral, more and more French choose cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study on 6 and 7 September with 1009 individuals, instead of 47%. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> For the funeral of a loved one, it is the reverse: the French prefer interment (53% versus 47%). </seg>
<seg id="2355"> If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are just 15% to choose cremation. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> In his book death in ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and Vice-Chairman of the national Committee of ethics of the funeral, insists on &quot;violence&quot; that constitutes the cremation, for survivors. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> There, with the cremation, &quot;a violence made to the beloved body&quot;, which will be &quot;reduced to a pile of ashes&quot; in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which &quot;would accompany the phases of mourning&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> There&apos;s also a &quot;symbolic violence&quot;, which takes the &quot;erasing the uniqueness and distinctive signs&quot; reduced to the &quot;anonymity&quot; of ash. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Why is is accepted without penalty in some Nordic and Protestant countries, it still lived in France? </seg>
<seg id="2360"> &quot;Because cremation is new&quot;, answers Marie-Frédérique Babu, President of the society of thanatology and author of the book Taming death. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> It is tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Tame the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director-general of the funeral Services of the city of Paris, for the deceased a ceremony worthy than that to which he would be entitled with a burial. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> The annual Ipsos survey shows a commitment very strong to the Organization of the ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> 77 percent of the French want a, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%). </seg>
<seg id="2365"> Now, 73% of people who have chosen cremation wants the Organization of a ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> 66% of atheists or non believers desire also. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Crematoriums have adapted to the evolution of society. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> &quot;For a decade, they strive to avoid family violence of a waiting, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the surrender of the ashes&quot;, notes Mr Michaud-Nerard. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> 70% of establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, carry out the following ritual: host the Assembly, appoint the deceased, connect it to the other, raise it, give meaning to his death, organize a farewell. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> This is the case at the crematorium in Père Lachaise, since 1998. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> The masters of ceremonies often are people who themselves are converted. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> There are also old Catholic priests. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> It is in this framework that the crematorium in Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invited the families of people who were crematisees in the year. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is rebroadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip. </seg>

<seg id="2394"> Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, which presents two new choreographies of group to dance dance: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second blown through the famous Gymnopédies of Satie piano solos. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> An evening that allows to see the Prism Chouinard, art, ICT and the black ink to white. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> A white screen serves as a wall. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> On the carpet, also white, in the immense space is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, forward, end as a line and dressed in black, a body profile. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Henri Michaux ink is projected on the screen. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The body, simple terms, takes its form. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> And this form will be that of the entire piece: a series of physical imitations of drawings. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, waiting on each side of the playground, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, emerge power. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> This game black and white&apos;s Henri Michaux is done in relays of solos, group in unison (a mass that makes solo), large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> We think &quot;Morning glory&quot;, where, solo, Chouinard was conducting a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, in line at the forefront. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> It is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The energy is high, always fast. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> There will be breakage when Carol Prieur réfugiera under the rug of dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, sobriety without restraint, a part of the poem of Michaux, monotone and monotone in the auction, and continue dancing. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> And music again, and the sequence of resume. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> This discharge sound and energetic, long, if possible, eventually faint and numb. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> As does also the regularity of Visual rhythm. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> There are some beautiful Flash - creating images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hair that will include ruffling or these black fabrics that prolong the lines. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> But choreographic approach lacks composition. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, imposed, with his tics. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Result: the body appear flat front designs. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Michaux inks, as forms of Gestalt, open a wider and is imaginary dance, more porous. </seg>

<seg id="2418"> The Gymnopédies, after intermission, is richer. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> The scene is partly draped gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> At the piano, dancers take turns to play the partitions. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Their blunders in music, touching, give a real fragility. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> On stage, pass the couples in love, very sensual, even erotic duets. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Group work, small solos of transitions, sets that are moving, backing vocals, writing is less binary. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> Clowns appear, also familiar with Chavez, sporting the red nose, in parades love men and women very polarized. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> The loves are carnivorous, leaking or players. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The gestures, the laughter and the squeaks transpose beautifully archaic, grace and the ridiculousness of the body in coitus, beings who are based. </seg>

<seg id="2428"> A clown is in scene when the public leaves. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> There, everything is permitted: the fourth wall falls, explored worlds overlap, the dancers cabotinent, descend among the spectators, pontificate, smoke, short, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder which remains sensual. </seg>

<seg id="2439"> Report: The Obama campaign considered as dropping Biden to Hillary Clinton </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The closest advisors of president Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, according to the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> This revelation is the most significant event which appears in the long-awaited book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann 2012 campaign, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and told Thursday night that the close associates of the president led «extensive into groups and polls work» end of 2011 to see if the eviction of Biden could help Obama for re-election while his hopes were being reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> According to the correspondent political Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary general of the White House Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice President by the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> The possibility of an Exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within Chicago and inside the Oval Office campaign HQ. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Only half a dozen close advisers of president - including Daley, the former head of campaign Obama Jim Messina and the former advisers to the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was under consideration. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> &quot;Double Down&quot; indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal ties&quot;, before finally to decide against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot;did not improve significantly the chances of success for Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually contemplated to replace Biden by Clinton. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> &quot;I said that I had considered a range of issues, and it was one of them,&quot; Daley told the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> Remember that at this time, the president was not in form, and so is saying, &apos; Lord, what can we do? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2450"> While Daley qualified examination of &quot;concerted&quot;, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that re-election campaign had invested heavily to discover if the change would be beneficial in the poll. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;Campaigns spend not much money to polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering to take measures&quot;, said Martin on AC360. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was considering replacement. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss then was aware of the possible reshuffle. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> Although Daley had said that he did not believe that the president &quot;was aware&quot; of possible change, the former Secretary general admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; did not definitively the question about if political polls had arrived on the desk of Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden in the presidential list was examined. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> &quot;Maybe,&quot; said Martin. </seg>

<seg id="2460"> From The Next Day, published in January, he has concocted a Deluxe reissue scheduled for 4 November, with several previously unreleased. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Four have already emerged on the canvas. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone breathless. </seg>

<seg id="2465"> A treat for his fans </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day. </seg>

<seg id="2474"> Are new recordings already in listening </seg>
<seg id="2475"> But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> The information, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the Web. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The Informer is double-sided: an ominous intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows to allow room for a pop ballad. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie wanted to make a small reference to the Rocket Man Elton John, or even to Gravity? </seg>
<seg id="2479"> With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in its element when it has more feet on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Space Oddity, at hand, was much more serious. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> On Born In A UFO, David Bowie is once again refers to its strangeness: would it come from another planet? </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Enchanting guitar riffs make you want to leave the land. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these titles: in turn informant, man on a rocket, potential Martian... </seg>
<seg id="2484"> He conceals and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane characters. </seg>

<seg id="2489"> It pushed the water rail in a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month until he is back on feet by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue of Alloa centre. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> The Director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: &quot;this water rail was probably a wintering migratory who came from Northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of the North Sea winds.» </seg>
<seg id="2491"> It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to seek refuge on the oil rig. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> He added: &quot;he was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2493"> The water rail was in good health when he was released. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV </seg>
<seg id="2495"> Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the service of Netflix video-on-demand via their television in the future which seems not-so-distant. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> The subsidiary of Cogeco indicated Thursday that it currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> &quot;This will help to highlight the most user friendly interfaces as well as more options,&quot; said president and Chief Executive Officer of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Cogeco Cable followed thus to competitors, like Bell, even though the subsidiary of Cogeco does not yet date defines in respect of this new platform. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> &quot;We must adapt and change or resist change and fail,&quot; said Mr. Audet. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The ultimate aim remains to offer tools that our customers do not have access currently. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable companies so that its service is available via their distribution platforms. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> The President and CEO. of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government in its speech from the throne, October 16. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> Ottawa wants to force TV cable and satellite providers to offer customers the possibility to pay for services à la carte. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> &quot;It is about two and half years we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important packages of channels, it does not work&quot;, stated Mr. Audet. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> However, he hoped that consultations conducted by the Council of broadcasting and telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> &apos;&apos; It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy in respect of television, &apos;&apos; said the CEO. Cogeco. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> The CRTC consults with the public since last week and they should continue with the industry next spring. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated recorded a profit net of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is a decrease compared to net earnings of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ per share, for the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> The Montreal-based company says this decline by costs of depreciation related to new acquisitions. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> Cogeco acquired in 2012 the cable company Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, to 1.36 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in the Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $ 526 million. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Regarding Cogeco revenues, they have grown by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> They are $ 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 ¢ per share, for the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Cogeco Cable revenues have however increased 45% to $ 470.4 million. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> The company has lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of clients of Cogeco Cable is growing 5546. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Mr. Audet is not concerned to see the number of clients fluctuate so. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he noted. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> It varies from one quarter to one with a very strong competition. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Alexei Miller of Gazprom said that gas pipeline Bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The beginning of the construction of the gas pipeline South Stream in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest projects energy to Europe, said the head of Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> &quot;A historical event took place today: construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, large-scale project the largest in Europe&quot;, said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> South Stream is expected to diversify routes of export from Russia to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukraine counterpart, countries through which passes the majority of Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk relative to the conventional ways, adds the Director. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Miller added that the direct junction towards Bulgaria, Member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> The Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project will be implemented in 2015. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries located downstream from here the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Unknown persons shoot at a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo </seg>
<seg id="2535"> Unknown hooded assailants opened fire Friday on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt no casualties, consequence of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, the police general Abdel Latif. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> This attack comes while the Egypt receives almost no more tourists since the army deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi early July and repressed in blood the manifestations of his supporters. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar </seg>
<seg id="2539"> In English literature courses, students will be studying at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> The review will also present &quot;new texts&quot; to encourage a more diversified reading. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> A course combining English literature and language will be deleted. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> From 2015, students must pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a qualification in English literature. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The Ministry of Education is required to publish tomorrow its new programs of English and maths - materials to undergo a radical overhaul. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> There will be changes in other core subjects next year. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Furthermore, Ofqual, the exams regulator Office, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and less of course. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Minister, said that there was a &quot;broad consensus on the need to reform our system of examinations to restore the confidence of the public&quot;, emphasizing the fact that the GCSE would be &quot;more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Studies show that English schools spend less time in math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> By comparison, Australian schools offer averaged 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make approximately 138 hours. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Well that there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of use of math time, close to the coalition Government sources reported that the GCSE maths comprehensive - as well as the greater importance attached to the substances listed in the international rankings - would encourage likely schools to ensure more classroom hours. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> The programme will place more emphasis on &quot;real-world problems&quot;, including financial mathematics. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The European elite is ready to do business with Britain? </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The Business campaign for Britain was launched in April with the promise to bring together firms and to define what the wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> To do this, we ordered the widest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Great Britain, companies and the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 heads of business, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Britain. </seg>
<seg id="2555"> The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> We discovered that the vast majority of companies seek now to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and grow while the States of the EU have stalled. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> They want to see the Government give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as China, the India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the process long and arduous reform of European institutional arcana. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> When asked their views on specific political issues - ranging from regulating monopolies to the laws on products - the majority of business leaders think that control of these key competencies should return to the hands of Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European - 40% of large firms trade area, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agree. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Finally, and what is more telling still, our business leaders survey revealed that a large majority would see Britain continue initiatives for a change of the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and politics. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a &apos;significant change&apos; which gives the power to the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The stakes are high - achieving change in the Treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would see a failover of 16% of the votes for the retention of the country in the EU in a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The Prime Minister should not doubt a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of the accession of Britain to the EU. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power back in the hands of the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the eurozone is committed towards an economic and fiscal union more close. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> The priority must be the jobs and growth in Britain and, as shown by the findings of our investigation, for businesses this means again to focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Beijing questioned a Turkmen Islamic movement </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;The support behind the scenes to the attack came East Turkestan Islamic movement based in Central and West Asia&quot;, said the boss of Chinese security organs to a television channel in Hong Kong, according to a video released Thursday night on an internet site. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), was speaking at Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> It is the first time that a Chinese official means a particular organization after the Monday attack. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> According to Chinese police, three Uighur family of the region in predominantly Muslim Xinjiang, border of several countries of Central Asia, precipitated their car to gas cans against the entrance to the forbidden city in Beijing, in a suicide attack which was two dead and 40 wounded. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> The driver of the car, his wife and her mother perished in the fire at the car. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> The Etim, claiming to fight for the independence of East Turkistan, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, has been classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> This movement is often referred to by the Chinese as being responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but his real influence is questioned by several experts. </seg>

<seg id="2586"> She was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the Summit and 15 m from the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> It is absolutely not moved during the rescue - she was frozen. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> But she is fine now. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> She ate biscuits after. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> It was a highly unusual appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> It&apos;s amazing that someone has noticed the dog. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby had much chance to escape unscathed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2593"> She could have been seriously injured or worse. </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Ruby was taken to the vet for a control; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> Miss Hall, Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: &quot;I was terrified watching relief.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I did not thought that she was up there. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It was surprising to have it again in arms. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and it was faded, it would be probably fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Firefighters have been amazing. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> What they did was really brave. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> We are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely terrific. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, said: &quot;there was fear that she falls but it has not moved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2603"> Firefighters have been great. </seg>

<seg id="2606"> Standard &amp; Poors rating agency lowered Friday the solvency of the Ukraine, putting in doubt the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The public debt of the country note passes to &quot;B-&quot;, sinking into the speculative investment category. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> It comes with a negative Outlook, S &amp;amp; P seeing at least one chance in three that she is again lowered within a year. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;It is increasingly unlikely that the Government&apos;s strategy would guarantee sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,&quot; said the U.S. Agency. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The Agency notes that the exchange reserves of the Ukraine fell by 26% between September 2012 to September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> These reservations, to which the authorities have massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the Agency deemed more likely a devaluation, which would inflate its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> Kiev needs further cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not having paid an invoice for $ 882 million. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of tension with its neighbour Russian, furious at the will of Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU late November. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> It was made public in the aftermath of the publication of official statistics showing that the country&apos;s economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter on contraction. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Its relatively modest debt exploded these last years and S &amp;amp; P considers to 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009. </seg>

<seg id="2626"> Singapore moneylenders are taking advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts </seg>
<seg id="2627"> At a pawnbroker from the commercial centre of Bendemeer to Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga filed a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay tuition for his daughters. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> &quot;My husband and I just bought a House so all my money is gone in,&quot; said Ms. Amirthalinga. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Although she won $3,000 of Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> In fact, demand is such in some parts of South-East Asia - where the indebtedness of households increases - ValueMax, where she completed her transaction, this week became the third company of loans on gage to be introduced on the stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> Pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money liquid - $1,300 Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it&apos;s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> In general, the Pawnbrokers of Singapore take an annual rate of interest effective from 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, the Pawnbrokers have the advantage of not to seek verification of solvency or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to the Pawnbrokers while families are feeling the pressure exerted by the increase in the cost of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> After five years of solid growth since the financial crisis world, and cheap credit fueled by a too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low and middle income families are turning to the Pawnbrokers to make up the difference while their economies are experiencing a slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> This week, the Standard &amp; Poors rating agency cited debt growing households, resulting primarily from the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks. </seg>

<seg id="2638"> The Malaysia arrived in top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Economists also fear the high level of indebtedness of consumers in Thailand, which came out narrowly this week of a technical recession. </seg>

<seg id="2642"> Historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made that people rushed to pledge their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewellery. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> In Singapore, about 70% of the articles pawned in the 200 shops of loan on pledge of the City-State are gold. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> People say, &apos;the price of gold is high, put in pledge the grandmother gold chain and we return the search next month. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> In Thailand, the largest operator of loan on pledge, EasyMoney, shops recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past months. </seg>

<seg id="2647"> The company will finance them using 60% of the 66 M$ of Singapore that it raised this week during its introduction on the stock exchange of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> While some lenders at reduced rates were subjected to criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they charge, Miss Yeah indicates that pledging offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but that in addition it does not increase directly the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> &quot;Clients mortgage assets that they already have, and the fact to monetize their personal property does not increase the indebtedness of households,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Pledging is better in better socially accepted as way to get guaranteed short-term funding. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> People who visit the Pawnbrokers are not not only those who have financial problems. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> Wealthy people of Singapore will also in the shops of loan on pledge ValueMax for pledge of gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in cash. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> We see clients from all walks of life. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> This can be of the affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for business activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to pass a hard cap&quot;, adds Ms Yeah. </seg>

<seg id="2664"> Investigations revealed that Ditta was a &apos;regular consumer&apos; of class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, it has sought to get in illegal way of information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police as part of a major investigation into trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for 1.5 million lbs, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Ditta, 42 years, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is revealed in broad daylight. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> Today in the Court of Assizes of Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, fell from grace after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three week trial. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> Counsel fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had regularly been in telephone contact with ALTID in February 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Two investigators followed the suspect and it were spotted arriving at the home of ALTID and placing drug, pure at 60%, under the bins of the lawyer in a black golf glove. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Shortly after the filing, Scarborough has been regularly in telephone contact with ALTID who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant Blackburn Rovers Club. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The lawyer returned home, discovered the drugs and they are called nine times. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The tribunal heard that Ditta was a &apos;regular consumer&apos; of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Ditta was later arrested but denied consume cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot;legal privilege&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they have all been seized and a hair sample was selected. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> During interrogation, he said that he had an office at his home, as well as to his place of work and it happened that clients call it home for legal matters. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> But the tribunal heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, including some that he had represented, after arrests key to tell them what investigators were aware. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Attorney Anne Whyte said: &quot;If someone needs to know that it should not violate the law, it is a lawyer. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer, and has be too involved with individual customers. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug providing the drug to his own lawyer dealer. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Some of its communications will undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was his lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> But this went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> It has hindered the police investigation as much as he was able to continue his criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Mr. Ditta did not honour to her profession, but has dishonored it. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> He too approached some clients, especially Scarborough, and it has left compromising its independence. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> ALTID denied any illegal action and said: &quot;if I was a lawyer corrupted, I&apos;m not, and I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have expected 15 hours, I would have immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2689"> But after the hearing, the Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr. Ditta moved from criminal lawyer criminal himself whenever he began to procure drugs from criminal organizations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2690"> His addiction to cocaine has forever compromised it and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organized criminal groups which instructed it to obtain valuable information about police investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and create a climate of confidence among the public. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Serious and organised by the Lancashire crime unit led the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who has been convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice now, testifying its commitment to prosecute criminals to justice. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Let this case serve as warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> We will find and you will translate in the courts. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> A difficult year for pharmacists </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The departure of more than 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) of Laval caused quite a stir at the direction of the Hospital of the health city, during the year 2012-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Because multiple retirements, maternity / short departures from, the Department of Pharmacy found highly deficient staff. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Missing nearly 30 per cent of the staffing requirements, making it this year &apos;very difficult&apos; financial, according to the head of the Department, Gillian Beaudet. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> However, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent labour, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a pharmacist engaged full time. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> It was not used to troubleshooting, explained Ms. Beaudet. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Have been streamlined or reduced some of our activities within the facility level, the time that things will relocate. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> It sure it worked hard to engage our young people [residents in pharmacy] so they come and stay here. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> There is a combination of circumstances that we were in a bad situation last year. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> Situation improved </seg>
<seg id="2728"> After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks much more easy for the pharmaceutical Department of the CSSS. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists were hired in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> In addition, the efforts made by the Department to retain have borne fruit, because four students currently in residence at Laval have also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Now, it&apos;s going much better, said the pharmacist. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> This will thus fill our departures from the past year. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Ever-increasing needs </seg>
<seg id="2735"> However, the situation remains delicate. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012. difficult to predict. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and employs many young women, so with pregnancies, almost always driving to three maternity leave when things go well, she added. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The past year was much more and there is no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult. </seg>

<seg id="2751"> Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run by being one of the most wanted men to Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to a sentence of 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosive devices used in the attacks. </seg>

<seg id="2756"> Prosecutors requested a sentence of life imprisonment, yet they could ask that the man, described as &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for its reputation as an expert in bomb-making, is sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two twin daughters of 39 years, Jane and Jenny in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators almost 10 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> On the edge of tears, she said that Patek ought to be sentenced to death. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> I really think that he should have to follow the same path as other men. </seg>

<seg id="2765"> Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who have been executed 4 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In reality, this man should be sentenced to death before the others. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others, is not much. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Patek is the last of the bombers of Bali to be brought to justice. </seg>
