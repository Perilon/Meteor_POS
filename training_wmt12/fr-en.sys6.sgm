<seg id="22"> When it comes therefore seek the winners in Libya, the West is not part </seg>

<seg id="77"> The power of an obese child: no breakfast does not and takes of the deli for dinner </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As current research obese children are from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> This shows again how is important the environment in which operates the human and the models that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children there for example the deli 50% more often than in normal weight children families. </seg>
<seg id="82"> 19% of the obese had fries dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of small large sport is also not a habit, as now is the case of most of the school children of today - only 15% responded that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Investigation of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey took place during the last school year and participated 900 pupils of primary schools in Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot;, action supported by general health insurance and the Unilever company. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since the beginning it more than 12000 students in sixth to the third who are registered in this project. </seg>
<seg id="88"> One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or obese children, is the absence of a correct diet and not enough exercise. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the surveyed children indicates for example eat 5 times a day small breakfast in case - breakfast - lunch - dinner, which is the a basic principles of good nutrition&quot;, is one of the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and Deli dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts draw attention to the fact that having a healthy development to some details database as a breakfast with the family at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat in the my same hour. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most of the families each take only breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst were noted is that one-tenth of the population takes any breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The questionnaire showed that obese children families consumed most unhealthy French fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks every day sweet drinks (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> More than 40% of surveyed children to the sport regularly but for parents it&apos;s half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Prepared your food </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the investigation has allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own food from possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are to a healthy eating plan, of the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meat and sweets. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The most alarming is such a great preference for sugary soft drinks&quot;, is indicated in the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch it is pasta that took place just before the white meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Children did not at all want to starch and the preference for fish and vegetables meals was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Cape health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The investigation has also shown that children are ready to change their habits from the time where they receive ad hoc information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the course of a control of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the awareness session&quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot;, on a attending a well determined intent to move towards healthy eating&quot;, indicate the results of the investigation. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The most memorable was for example the sweet lemonade because children have begun to give preference to drinking water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children were most often marked on the questionnaire the white meat and fish as a main course and would reduce the flat sweet and &quot;knedliky&quot; (Czech specialty of pellets of flour bread or potatoes). </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In an article in presentation on how to learn for stylists, I began a little bit angry because there were many from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I was not thinking about what would happen later. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is going on. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> More we are approaching final examinations and we are waiting for practical exercises and information. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it is really &quot;pissed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we have with the Director Alenka (during the there is no boy) treated in the way to dress up the woman is not standard measurements. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And women of this type is the majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> One has one small neck, the other a boy body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer must optically how ammenuiser of the large arms, extend a neck or adding necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We are thus arrived to beautifully highlight the character and also do not dress way too conspicuous types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hip and a fine size. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If there is such a difference between waist and hips in a way that skirts or trousers are not at all, it worth to be customized. </seg>
<seg id="124"> And you will not regret it for clothing falling impeccably is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt on as you will feel much better than slides permanently, is wrapped and does not take the belt and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or well embroidery. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are of course many examples d &apos; various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received. </seg>
<seg id="128"> But I also am afraid that on what I do at home he would too. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each trainee received a celebrity getting dressed for the day and the evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the current appearance, the type of mode of personality and appearance. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will have to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know of the Victoria&apos;s Secret campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> At the bottom of me, this makes me happy, because it is better that to dress up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, which took almost one hundred kilos lately (don&apos;t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or even the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must cut and sewing from magazines or search on internet, print and graphic design work. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, as told to the final result, expresses our style and our relationship with the graphic creation. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Reflect also on the graphic part of the styling is also important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Designer dresses not only the physical but for example creates productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends in handbags, coats, etc...). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Mario Kamenik, fashion designer and graphic designer, spoke of this. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But this... until Sunday </seg>
<seg id="139"> The designer must have a general vision </seg>
<seg id="140"> Three guests of specialty gave a look diversified at the Saturday meeting filled with information about the different types of characters. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and Ben Renc, fashion photographer. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a talented stylist known to work with a single clothing in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Variability is for this important example. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As for example the trench coats which should be conventionally with jeans and a t-shirt as a coat light but also it can also dress the naked body, with some shoes and make a photo as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or even just back the sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play with it&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I especially appreciated the following advice: &quot;To work you will need to know the rules perfectly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;You can then begin to breach,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I understand why it strives to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines you see sometimes something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> No statement on fashion shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> I know again, with photographer Ben mode as the fashion designer must have many more variants of clothing than those that are photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> That is to say that for fashion story which will have ten pages (so 10 models) I must be ready in &quot;retailer&quot; at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> We count with this in a creation of a model. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that the image and style are sometimes half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look Madonna is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made it a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains cautious. </seg>
<seg id="159"> And the known faces sometimes regard them as unnecessary (it is enough that I know something but what I look goes second). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone is making a styling on our part, we must then rely on the fact that he dictate us with a high probability a (smaller) completely different size than it was in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It remains then to browse google and ensure if boulevard info are State of the celebrity in question, if it is lost or enlarged etc... </seg>
<seg id="162"> Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart qu &apos; it is not enough to the fashion designer fashion orientation and whether assemble models. </seg>
<seg id="163"> It must communicate with people he gets dressed and it is thus important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Namely, guess people, not to flatter, keep his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manager asks you to sort his Cabinet and the complete new you can not just throw and tell him, my God what horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You will find a few cases you will find nice and him you acquaintance with what to wear,&quot; said Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It showed us concretely what must all contain what is called the &quot;placovka&quot; or the fashion designer bag. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is that you hang around the waist and you have on itself to everything you need. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Addition things clearly defined as scissors, roller for removal or yet to nurse pins, there are also of nylon yarn (that the designer uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the PIN or other type of clasp is not well-tested as they may damage the garment) or even a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For we are not only of people who listen to but who tried something how practical they taught us how ressemeller correctly of the shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And in session photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damage, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And thus we have pasted and glued. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We didn&apos;t have the right touch scissors to not inadvertently injure. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Therefore real skills. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The jurisdiction which I State is not for my girlfriend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small summary of what we&apos;ve learned over the second weekend of course </seg>
<seg id="178"> I began more and more to understand what to do the styling profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that each say what he wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> The need for speed the Run dispute throughout America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a race without problem turns because of a set of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do in a routine morning shift at work. </seg>
<seg id="182"> This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each but it does no good if no one has wanted to do something more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new Subtitled The Run part has produced great expectations before its release. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed already old and out a kind of game from the playable parts that count not only with points. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were so curious how will be the added passages in which the main hero out of his car and made what it feels like. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what is atttendait. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Are potentially of Arcade Racing Games but all is coming down because of some unnecessary errors that exist already for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> It is not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure starts very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are caught in the adventure the main hero Jack has emotional problems and to address these issues is to participate in illegal races across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is to reach the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea was interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten steps, in addition to 50 racing then. </seg>
<seg id="194"> The result is that each race is on another route and the steps in different environments which differ quite well with each other and are interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> The player does not have the feeling a moment that the game offers something similar. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are in addition quite pretty even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Finally this is not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But driving across the desert, in landscapes of fall or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The tests are more from time to time with of a non-standard element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sand storm which reduces significantly the visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Then in the mountains you must pay attention to what an avalanche is not upon you. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Next to this the different races are well arranged one behind the other. </seg>
<seg id="203"> It is only that a small number but this is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> There are the moments you strive you exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the clock) and then still awaits an another duel with an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> From time to time you also have police in the game and trying to get the difficult situation. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Novelty are the passages out of vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It&apos;s rather una animation interactive when most of the time Jack fled to someone and you must help him by typing the right button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> What is surprising it is that there are fewer moments of this type than what you expect (to be practical in there that three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> The result was like this because this element will not interfere with and moves, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of conduct is in the tradition of the previous games. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot not be negative. </seg>
<seg id="213"> With respect to the realistic simulation you go elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But although one can find better in the conccurrence model of conduct goes very well with the type of racing design. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Therefore everything is ok. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The problems start to appear after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> At the 2(ü) of the model of driving, the collision is not yet to the point. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We expect this game not complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how to behave your self, it is therefore not completely good. </seg>
<seg id="219"> In tight overruns you touch sometimes each other slightly but otherwise your auto part in crazy acrobatics. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or it is in crumbs. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Rebooting is so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the game setting back at the last point in the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But you have not only to 5 restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When you have used 5 reboots you resume the game from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is therefore more a tool, for the case where something happens not properly, that something you can truly count on. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes reboots do not help and the solution must be found to be memory remémorrant the piece of route in question. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The great problem of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For example there are some turns that must be addressed in a certain way otherwise it does not. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Otherwise you have on a given location &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles always in the same configuration that you come first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late. </seg>
<seg id="230"> What angry are situations when you see pass easily the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, need you either to set aside and the conturner either curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is if you go out to him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; in such a way that for the given situation it is always close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents still have other benefits. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During all the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you still have the same player above you in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This annoys the most end-game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent must at all costs before you. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it passes before you cache you the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and a good number of times you enter in collision. </seg>
<seg id="237"> One can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you you bored quickly. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it&apos;s a shame because through a model of conduct simple the game is interesting and places with so many action that you do not have the time to follow all what is happening. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And it is equal if it is because the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance to be bored or even something else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> The original idea is the change of car in the races. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must pay attention to gas on routes pump because you can change car however most of the time that you just. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Sports cars are ideal for the cities, the large American displacements for straight highways, and super sports cars to exotic trappings on highly technical lines for example on Switchback roads in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> And the mode of challenges, which are racing in particular places you know of the adventure, goes very well with the main plan of the history. </seg>

<seg id="252"> The technical part of the game is not extra, but the Visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super. </seg>
<seg id="253"> What bothers it is that in more extreme situations, Imaging does not level and in some tragic cases. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This concerns especially accidents with a large number of participants when fluid Imaging you is no more. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The sound is good and the track is the choice. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In order to appeal to the largest number and particularly the most to the young public a new soundtrack was created in style &quot;I mix everything&quot;, but can be expected to that person will buy the game for music. </seg>

<seg id="282"> Madam Vicenova rendered tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;From the beginning sounded the criticism that it is bland, it&apos;s a rond-de-cuir, that he cannot rempplir no mission and I must say that it has cut the breath to everybody because his role to perfection&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="285"> She explained the new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and defence in an answer to the question: &quot;Who is who in the European Union?&quot; &quot;At what phone number should I call?&quot;, so as an important step to the uniqueness and a greater legibility of the States the Union policy, as is China or the India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants prohibit us our (cooked paste cheese which smells very strong) syrecky </seg>

<seg id="295"> Madam Ambassador recalled the slogans with which she arrived in Brussels &quot;to a understandable Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;I really don&apos;t like the abbreviations, foreign words, the jargon that no one understands.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;As must understand the citizen that it is true that in Brussels no one pickles round or twisted, bananas differently large either that person do we prohibited to the syrecky&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="299"> A multispeed Europe is waiting for US </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and people who see things in their negative aspect more than positively. </seg>

<seg id="312"> History of a mark: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The IBM innovator starts the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone were to search for the word that expresses to the closer the strategy IBM, nearest would be &quot;the long run&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt to be very current and however since its creation it has been 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the Thomas j. Watson Sr visionary. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little people to be willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its slogan &quot;think &apos;!&quot;became the imprint which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the magazine internal IBM began to edit in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was the basis of the culture of the soignement company developed by Watson. </seg>
<seg id="320"> We IBM means thinking long term continuous movements directed towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived a hundred years with the fact that she remained always faithful to its core values and however did not fear to change all the others around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us in our first century of technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more &quot;a DIAND for the the current Director of the firm of Samuel j. Palmisano anniversary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="324"> A well prepared system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, in the years thirty, began to take care of its employees as Bata in Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees have paid vacation, insurance paid by the employer more uniform of elegant employee and a well developed system of rewards to inventors and the commmerciaux. </seg>
<seg id="326"> IBM has a well developed customer relations system in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was initially great in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have a choice. </seg>
<seg id="328"> The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman-Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM. </seg>
<seg id="329"> It works at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of head of sales, Marketing and strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM over the past years is the so-called of jamy, of brain-storming online from what are from much of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that there a lot of ideas - in the firm there are about 500000 people working. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> It is the image internal and external company providing him a safe position in the areas of business. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since IBM had a concept instead of institution to a technology firm&quot;, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the school of Economics of Harvard and author of the book on IBM. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technlogique firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the world of business by using its technology,&quot; added Geogre Colony of Forrester Research Consulting firm. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and create the market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - well or the &quot;Grande Bleue&quot;, as it is called colloquially in the United States in its slogan-in hundred years it grew to become one of the largest global firms. </seg>
<seg id="338"> This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, accommodation, services of Council at the level of the server up to nanotechnology products. </seg>
<seg id="339"> She has many patents for all American technology companies and five of its employees were awarded a Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his discoveries to range for example distributor of tickets, payment card, financial swap, the bar code or even the floppy disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM ended the year with $ 220 billion the second most large technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Overview in advance </seg>
<seg id="343"> They are not all innovations and fabrications which have had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example did not betting on a clean operating system OS/2, the Prodigy online service or to the IBM PCjr computer: </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;From the moment when your business is built on the movement in advance you can not emotionally remain hanging on the past,&quot;said Samuel j. Palmisano.&quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="345"> Why IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike for example the conccurent Microsoft which at the base stands and remains under the operational system Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> A technology perspective </seg>
<seg id="348"> In revenues IBM services, who are trained to a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However even in 1990 it was with more than the half of the strongest participation representative of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000 IBM sold assets to low performance for $ 15 billion, in secure period $ 58 billion it invested in the purchase of Outlook technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> She continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first Commander Thomas j. Watson, which during the great economic crisis has also increased its investment volume. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It appears now that IBM is the current crisis without be concerned? </seg>
<seg id="354"> The IBM share price progessé 2008 rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The logo of the firm IBM is to change all but not its values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Can be expected to do that this giant flexible control of other crises. </seg>
<seg id="357"> History of IBM: A partir slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="358"> IBM (International Business Machines) society was born in New York City a hundred years ago; It was originally the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>

<seg id="368"> Watson was the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership it is his son who served in the Director Chair, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his direction IBM began development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s people and computers from IBM help NASA a guide flights in the cosmos - on mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classic PC that determined the standard of computer of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later IBM sells its computers to the Chinese company Lenovo factory, but bought PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting company and began to deal with Council and services with a high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy successful IBM last three years - is the Smarter Planet &quot;a smarter planet&quot; concept. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its goal is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited as for example transport and management of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> IBM has developed for what is in the field of trade there is little time a &quot;Smarter trade&quot; platform that helps the business to manager the commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a strong history also on our territory. </seg>

<seg id="404"> The worst defects of women: this also concerns you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men to determine defects typical of women, all, each like the others, are capable of out &quot;of their sleeve&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="406"> My dear ladies, you know in the following lines of the female defects arriving in pumping blood from the veins of the men. </seg>
<seg id="407"> Purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Your half made you remarks that you are dependent on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Do you purchase you at least one garment per week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> You are happy to buy and packet time balances? </seg>
<seg id="411"> In your case is purchasing as a defect. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for shopping. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But you say, which withstand shopping for clothing stores, look for yourself pretty clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> And although most women buy a hobby, this can become a real hell for man. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Remember just how many times did you say to your spouse that he wait at the entrance... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too big&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;I need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should begin to make sport?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;I you like?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> These sentences do remind you they not something? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> You are therefore part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance. </seg>
<seg id="423"> Is not the question that you should stop you take care of yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always starting to complain of its appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Strong sex does not hesitate to say that more the frequency of these complaints and more women become springs. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and tidiness to first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It&apos;s like an infinite merry-go-round. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Washing Windows, vacuuming, cleaning soil, make the dust, stripping the bathroom - and this twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> You comments to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, to the children that they have soiled the sink, clogged the living room window, and it gives you lot of work? </seg>
<seg id="429"> In case you are precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that should nothing exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This benign desire of cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even the family peace. </seg>
<seg id="431"> The work of undermining </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;Met this tracksuit worn in the trash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You accounts put these old socks again tomorrow?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="435"> If you are on your partner work undermined in this way several times a day, you really the break down. </seg>
<seg id="436"> It is clear that you don&apos;t think about evil you want everything to be perfect. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps that if men knew, women would not do for both undermine working... </seg>
<seg id="438"> Defamation, the persiflage </seg>
<seg id="439"> Defamation, the persiflage but also insults against someone are also characteristic of some women. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are particularly brought to the relations and thus are pleased to treat topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Perhaps each of us allowed to escape a small harmless persiflage here and there. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The hand on the heart but this is a feature of women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But the worst are those that advise, persiflent, even despise others and are for others - particularly the work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation to the victory of Philadelphia </seg>
<seg id="445"> Forward hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory of Philadelphia during the Monday match NHL Carolina ice and is again at the head of Czech productive for the competition players. </seg>
<seg id="446"> From the point of view of 39 star Claude Giroux, who still made a pass over and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr also recorded two goals in the game. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr after the game told journalists from us that he warned Giroux that this would be a great evening. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;I felt it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes this feeling fall you on it&quot; said Jagr after Giroux action marked the first launch of the Flyers goal. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A moment later there was a second assault of the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the goals of Hurricanes for the puck and presented to Maxime Talbot striker. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically to Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jagr it marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love playing with him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I do not mean that it is the best player of the League but it really is part of the top three,&quot; said Jagr about its centre. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I had never thought that I play later in a career with a hokeyjiste like him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am really happy with this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play him&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="475"> &quot;But there is nothing to do, it&apos;s like that&quot;, said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Replacement on replacement there is no just and we could not resist&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had just to simplify the game, push the puck out of our area&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="481"> How the price of travel since 1989 have evolved </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there was in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel of State agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> At that time travel agencies proposed travel mainly in the countries of the Socialist bloc, because travel to the West were very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists were traveling for the holidays in Germany of the East, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was authorized to travel in Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an inclination to the West and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the Socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the Socialist block (also for the Czechoslovak) to travel individually even in the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Where the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation if individual travel was not authorized. </seg>
<seg id="488"> At that time travel agencies also offered trips to the West however should be queuing overnight with a sleeping bag or even have an &quot;understanding&quot; in the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> And even after that it was not yet won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The agreement for currency that was the condition for travel to the West was denied the &quot;politically incorrect&quot; people who could not travel. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was not however exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many houses of campaign and cottages that the Czechs are purchased, and habit lasts up to now. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Czechs travel have been known since 1989 a great revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Although until 1989 holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria were the most, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The great paradox which we are not aware today that is the most popular country Croatia where it was not possible to go freely to 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The removal of the visa in the 1990s of the last century in Western neighbors caused a huge wave of short term especially in Austria visits in Vienna and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechoslovak could not long travel by air to the West that everyone wanted to see at least a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example in Paris travel organizations were the Czechs to sleep in tents in parks because our income we could not pay the hotel or pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> The typical feature of a trip of Czechs was to carry its own food cans, sausage, etc... to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another instant large was also the interchangeability of the Czech Crown which enabled our tourists finally after decades of able to freely buy Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living as the average salary increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With a growing demand for travel travel agencies began since 1997 to prepare towers with links by air charters which through contracts have wonderfully reduced costs to what there was before. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 1990s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most of the developed countries around the world other than the EU that later facilitated our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting in the history of post-revolution tourism, when was prepared the first air charter to exotic country, the Thailand, from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since this year, as each year of the charters Air direct take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; This winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> It is more than 100000 Czechs visiting exotic countries each year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Still a time interesting in this period which symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17, 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to pull completely in the Group of developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time still in the history spent more than 15 000 crowns per person for a holiday abroad including annexes loads. Crowns per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly must find its President but may end in a situation with no solution &quot;a pat&quot; </seg>
<seg id="511"> Near 5mois already Czech football is without President and risk that Ivan Hasek&apos;s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after even a General Assembly which will take place Thursday at Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> However there is still no agreement according to which regulation of voting should be. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without this agreement it is not possible to start to vote for one of the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek resigned in June and in the course of his called colleagues a unite and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to differences between the Chambers of the Association who are unable to agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This has fully shown on 16 September when he had to choose a new President. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague as the negotiation is still blocked and it has not even been question to deal with how to elect. </seg>
<seg id="519"> He did not agree on the fact of knowing who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, apparently, statutory representatives or officials well also invested with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single item there was a partial agreement since this moment with the help also of the Bureau for the State and the law, according to which the representation on the basis of the full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Differences still continue on the regulation for the election. </seg>
<seg id="522"> It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary, bargaining has brought nothing to the situation </seg>
<seg id="523"> Opinions on the possibilitě to vote have changed several times but the neuralgic point remains always the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how third round to do not fall into the pat. </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The bone of contention is the following: either proceed according to the bylaws or even find another model&quot;, was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Association of the Czech Republic football Dusan Svoboda that represents professional football association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the rules of the planned model WINS in the third round of the candidates who received the most votes in percentage in the House for which he is a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw for that is the candidate who received the largest percentage of votes of both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech part studies the condition that the winner should be two-thirds less than the percentages of votes. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Only this would then lose the idea of two previous tours and would completely deny the bicameral concept&quot;, admits Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian part and that the best would not change the regulations and vote according to the statutes in force. </seg>
<seg id="530"> It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even if he considers that the regulation of elections according to the bylaws benefit the most Pelta among all candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I wish that you vote up according to the bylaws of the association&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So there is not yet ludicrous ideas designed by a representative as in past General meetings&quot;, said the owner of Victoria Plzen which is candidate for the first time and that in its submissions is set primarily against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> There will be a new President he at Nymburk and believes that applicants shall cooperate in the future together and constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification today in European Championship should calm down everyone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will be back on a wave of happiness and it y aure more lively for cooperation&quot; adds officer Jablonec who among the three has the largest experience in direction of both professional and at the regional level football. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more pessimistic. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to change regulations to drawing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may cause a deadlock again to the General Assembly&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope all well as the healthy reason will win,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> There is not much time for a common to the parties agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some réuunions should be made directly to Montenegro but who say if any branch of football will be full for the game. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The specially chartered flight which had to travel up to Podgorice among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, departed for technical reasons and sought a variation to take part of the Executive Committee in the field of retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be decisive. </seg>
<seg id="546"> The Minister of education of the youth and sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the parts torn in the highest sports association of the country and bring them to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game there are many: a State staffing, the credibility of the football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of February. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclik goes to the fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of Plzen Tomas Paclik footballers had seen before the General Assembly which the profile would have answered everything he asks for a new President of the Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) football it would not put in campaign for this high office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If a candidate I support, I fight for him and I am not running for the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation it was not possible to find a candidate,&quot; said Paclik in the Czech press agency (TKC). </seg>
<seg id="552"> The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl just attempt to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which priori would be given favorite for this election. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclik also noted that it win the elections it would hold the position of President only until 2013 year for a General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> He would see in the function a manager experienced and high level but which is not linked with the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have discussed with people who have the profile&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me this has been terrible when some told me that they do not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change this image&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="558"> This man, said, interfere with most Paclik, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the regional of Plzen Roman Berbr football Union, the contreversée reputation known behind the scenes as a lobbyist can influence the voting delegates of the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he earned the State would remain and there is nothing new in football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;And with the support of Berbr, who is a trader of high flight, it would still less favourable football&quot;, proclaimed Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="562"> What shocks still is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced it there a few years in tapping an investigation on a case of corruption, for which Pelta has emerged without any penalty. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what Pelta prestige would bring to football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we considered in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA&quot; said Paclik, who said some time &quot;If Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen&quot; ago. </seg>
<seg id="565"> If the Paclik win the vote on Thursday, should show that it would cooperate with Felta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September which ended by a fiasco, think the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first I would go with that&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;There, big on capability&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;He would be able to stand for example as head of representation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But as manager of the Association would not capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I do not the nose in that I do not know&quot;, said Paclik in September attracted great attention when it ruled to the annulment of the Board of arbitrators with Ludek Macela replaced Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclik says that it would be at the level to lead the Association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and he led since last year the Plzen club which celebrated his triumph in the first division with its support last May. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the force to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;I freinerais the influence of certain interested groups for example tend to affect the disciplinary Commission and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste,&quot; said Paclik who does chache not his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with high level policy would provide for more money tax on games sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key points that the new President should deal with.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If it comes to the tax on gambling as the State political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Paclik does not support binding current with the Plzen club as something negative even if itself says that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above the parties&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not the ideal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;I see no reason to pass my actions of the club of Plzen to someone if I return a year and a half after&quot;, said Paclik. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statute for the AFRT which should put an end to situations of pat. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidate to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if elected, will the AFRT have new statute which should end in the future in the battles on the regulation for the elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Jablonec official is before the meeting of Thursday at Nymburk very optimistic and think the success today of the representation of football should calm this squabbles before the vote. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta before the election in September has not carried out promised precisely to focus on national representation and to obtain financial means if he is elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed and the delay of two months might enable him to defend his vision of the direction of the football and present it in a broad context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people at all levels are the football for a long time and expect that Thursday there is a President&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that it is the best time to have someone take the direction of the Association,&quot; he adds, but it is all connected with the club of Jablonec, worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="590"> This is also why it has enough experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria in era of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;&quot; Unfortunately l&quot;General Assembly of June of the statutes were approved were not perfect as all seen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already been a President since September&quot;, said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> This is the review of the most important document of the civic association which took the attention of the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in cases where it does not work&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a principle without which we cannot exist,&quot; added Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Then he strives, told not to confront his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He said previously that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes in its training in law and that he knows full well that its candidate opponent would be his first Vice President. </seg>
<seg id="599"> He did not attack since long Tonas Paclik which on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It evolves in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were however not the most honourable and surprised many people in the campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;This is also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; said Pelta to address his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations made in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level to national advocacy competitions. </seg>
<seg id="604"> It should be a vitirne of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I am also incidental to complete all cases that begin with that of Bohémians either the corruption scandal following.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;I immediately entrerais in negotiations with the public sector and private so that we can get enough money for any football&quot;, told the Czech CTK News Agency the 46th candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He also added that his appointment at the head of the football would bring no change in people. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I should meet with all staff&quot;, he said to Strahov Monastery where reigns an understandable nervousness since he did no management. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Although there are catastrophic scenarios provided with the General Assembly, he believes, that delegates won&apos;t go in Nymburk for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Third Tower we come to a single point. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and he does get it when there is a new leader in his head&quot;, as States Pelta optimistic way two days before the likely decisive day for his official career. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> &quot;If the Vice President current Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Association of the Czech Republic l football&quot; General Assembly would Thursday it not please many people, it seems. </seg>
<seg id="614"> However, Rajchl promises that in the event that he is elected will begin to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants systemic change and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the different areas of football. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He has also promised to resolve the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, make football more than money and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President I want to take care of the football as a whole&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;Of international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, of a powerful youth football and professional football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But I do not say that I will do this alone&quot; said Rajchl in an interview for TKC. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and want to distribute powers in the Executive Committee so that each Member is responsible for a particular domain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I distributing difficult missions face football for a major step forward&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;Many people will be unhappy because it will be to start working hard rather than criticize others&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> He did state, said that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;About me, it knows that I work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;but I need to know if this is worth and if I will have people behind me who I will always sticks in the wheels and issue doubts on each of my actions&quot;, explaining why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people even told me that I must not give up because they also surrendered&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;Cest a confidence that I cannot betray&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates said, is also to continue work started with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;For the last two years there has been a great work and I do not want down.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that have been initiated which will have consequences in a few years and I do not wish that someone the stops.&apos;, said with the fear that the situation within the Union in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta return as it was before Hasek.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in a systematic work and this is something that Mirek Pelta fails to&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him are people who fairaient of football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been chosen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;Can I blame a certain number of things but surely not support somebody &apos; a &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I strive to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to make the football for all because everyone will be pleased not only those who have been chosen&quot; </seg>
<seg id="636"> And it confirms again that it would be only a President of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;And if there are that say otherwise, I am ready to make the maximum of Moravia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is the time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts a Czech and one Moravian which winners would be placed in the first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;There is no situation as currently with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is now to find young players.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="640"> As Tomas Paclik, President of the Club of Plzen, is entered in the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess its own chances of winning. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I sense permanent support of the Czech House elected me its Vice - President and knows that with me it will be a success&quot;, said Rajchl plans among its future success to save tens of millions of Crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of contracts with television and the Act on games. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association is not United is a fault common to all. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he said about Pelta &quot;that he is disqualified because with the Czech footblal would lose its credibility&quot;, he believes that the second player Paclik is a strong candidate who has what offer to football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can doubt to Plzen this year he did a superb job&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If he was elected he would surely continue in which was started by Hasek and would not significant change among those in the committees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;He wouldn&apos;t be wasting its success,&quot; said Rajchl who has assessed his rivals. </seg>

<seg id="651"> A book shows in what swimming pool can experience the more well-being. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder went to travel of research during the past 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit. </seg>

<seg id="663"> A dive in a swimming pool and sauna oil volatile - factor of well-being in swimming halls are enormous because all the senses are aroused by Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builders would be given a bit more punishment, the rooms to swim could be a true delight for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor on a water surface in swimming halls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;It is a transparent, but reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the entire building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All surfaces are optically in a double way: high arches, multicoloured tiles, springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The volume of small format picture &quot;Badefreuden&quot; reports of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of the historical welfare - it certainly want to make a jump in the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The collector Meder found remarkable copies during his research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Next to the splendid well-being baths as bath Széchenyi age of 100 years in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave in Miskolc-Tapolca bath) and a spa bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and in a building in the shape of bottle. </seg>
<seg id="670"> However, the pools heated in the open air of the Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a roof of the bath of Zürich was all over the city in his eyes, you can admire the Arlberg snow from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: the Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which to observe the animation on the ski trail. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design expected swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles a UFO just land on the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> In the winter, steam rises three trays open, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal toward the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> the smell of bleach is not all pools of the Meder collection. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths come from the smell of sulphur, the Árpád-Spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, it is difficult to believe, to find in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt glue you the skin as soon as you let you drag in the pool - a special spa experience. </seg>
<seg id="677"> During his quest for the beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: when she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricaded field. </seg>
<seg id="678"> Bath designed by the architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed down. </seg>
<seg id="679"> By throwing a glance through the window of the building-Art new red-white-yellow, she observed the development of weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> It observed the opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palace of baths of Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This building has already survived three phases; can discover not only néo-romains elements leaving since its conception in 1844 but still a style that was added in 1900 Alhambra Moorish room. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since its careful modernisation of 1995, the thermal Palace remains favourite bath of the expert pool, Iris Meder - and not only because she is originally from Schwarzwald. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;This is already a beautiful performance that of melt if different styles of construction in a so great unit&quot;, said Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a Palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agricultural speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> The German bank examines in detail the speculation on the first matter </seg>
<seg id="687"> Of Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> The German bank abandons - it&apos;s speculation on raw materials? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to consider the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg- </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that banks speculate on materials such as corn and wheat. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two-thirds of those surveyed even require that the German Bank and other credit institutes discontinuent this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> It is the result of a Forsa survey of consumers Foodwatch organization agenda. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Author Harald Schumann said in this article that awards on global commodity speculation, pushing prices upwards and that banks share complicity of world hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> Consumer protection campaign aligns specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley Act the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But the majority of experts meanwhile share the opinion that the betting public detached offers and requests - and benefit at the expense of very poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann was responding to criticism of U.S. competitors differently: he promised to investigate the allegations and said, &quot;no case is worth to play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="701"> Based on information from SPIEGEL ONLINE international working group is currently examining accusations of Foodwatch-Report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank must be submitted - with recommendation, usually. </seg>
<seg id="703"> End of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn. </seg>
<seg id="704"> This could result in a reduction of the raw material market either even a complete abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann built its Image </seg>
<seg id="706"> The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has welcomed the new, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of financial sector: &quot;speculation on food prices rising shows a particularly drastic manner, how the banks of today affect the general interest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank must remove all its portfolio investments, for which money has been invested on food speculation&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It matters little, for Mr Ackermann, if it comes to the starving people or if Deutsche Bank reputation is at stake.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> Awareness of Ackermann may seem at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the Group wishes to present a picture perfect, a few months before leaving office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change nothing to what is provided on the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="712"> LL could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And potential losses, it did little to to worry about - his successor is in looming. </seg>
<seg id="714"> One in two would terminate on commodity investments. </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far more than 30 000 Internet users already participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted surveys of 1001 people. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the price of food products are made. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many customers of the Bank would also the personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two, following the survey, would terminate all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on raw materials. </seg>
<seg id="720"> &quot;43 percent déconseilleraient of such a databank to their surroundings, 49% responded that they consider the termination of their account to change d&quot; Bank. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21st House in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion who moved </seg>
<seg id="723"> Of Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with UPS, downs and a Happy End: Pavilion Austrian world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won the award, was a Museum in Vienna, has remained empty and fell in ruins. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it is again open and takes place exhibition house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If it is for a modern war, for its clear forms architecture, its hangars glass, its bright, bold patterns and its new building materials that are typical of the belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Pavilion of Schwanzer once received the &quot;Grand Prize for Architecture&quot; for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is considered until today as a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He made so famous architects, that he also built for the following Austrian Expo Pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary home to BMW four-cylinder and its adjacent construction in the shape of Bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at international level in 1973. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its flag as a temporary construction project had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the garden Switzerland Station South of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a Museum of the 20th century opened. </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was physically or technically adapted for a museum - step of walls for hanging works of art, so not a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> However it was also long used, until &quot;that contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and it is more and more dilapidated. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, now bears the name of &quot;House of the 21st century&quot;, and will be used in the future as Museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday night the Belvedere Museum opened, to which house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck to any point of view. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The new start has been completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new Director in 2007 the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, has promoted a historian of art to a career significant among other things in his youth of figure skater, later at Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Museum of modern of Salzburg art director, she has carried out particularly the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, she received public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for contemporary art, works by the sculptor Fritz Wotruba Foundation bearing the same name have been exposed, a café and a library there, and an Office shall be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict monitoring, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For implementing Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity Joseph Olbracht secession and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was &quot;an extremely important place&quot; place where he had seen &quot;virtually every weekend&quot; exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project, and he was aware of the problems of the building, who lost in generosity and light following his move to Vienna and its change of use. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current changes, there were big problems: l &quot;building was&quot;a Gulf energy&quot;, said Krischanitz.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="745"> Profiles of Windows of glass facades were changed, reinforced insulation glass fibre glass was installed and the roof replaced with a special safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and filled with coatings of asbestos were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements have been the place for the new operation, a light panel screened between home and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entry - it is almost new construction, but still the light Pavilion Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The exterior doors of origins remained, the House is painted in a shade of red-brown rust protection. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the movie theatre is even exactly the same as what it was once. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this under close supervision by the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often good and inexpensive materials were to be found, and which also appeal to the monuments protection agency&quot;, said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a gross floor basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, l &quot;building has remained flexible and light.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="753"> It would have been difficult with the flag, &quot;from Brussels&quot;, said Krischanitz recently, a typical history of &quot;Drop-in-the-City&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such an architecture is still &quot;in the wrong place&quot; and wants to still &quot;awaken the conscience&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: Garden Switzerland autour stands precisely the &quot;District of the central station&quot; all newly provided, with offices and apartments. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And an another stroke of luck will perhaps happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of an another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as he says, it is already negotiating with the city for a site in the vicinity of the Switzerland garden. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Bahn is planning a million winter crisis package. </seg>
<seg id="758"> The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid accidents of train in the winter. </seg>

<seg id="765"> The goal is to rid docks snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of necessary service track equipment within a period of four to five hours. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Two months ago the head of station Rüdiger Grube warned the Government and industry at a Conference at the top of the accidents of trains occurred also this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> &quot;Last winter the railway company had lot of problems for transport d&quot; users, because it lacks among other reserves weather conditions difficult. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Therefore, many new regional trains waiting for years an authorization on the part of the Ministry of railways. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The railway company has for years what to do, because she must check the axles of the ICE trains significantly more often in the workshop, after failure of axles has occurred on an ICE Cologne central station. </seg>
<seg id="771"> The German &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; bank pays millions of penalties in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="772"> After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is new in the USA: the German bank &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; must pay a fine of s &quot;amount to millions.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="776"> These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led banks down. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased to be able to find a solution to this issue, that the parties begin a procedure to the tribunal&quot;, said an interlocutor of the Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank has recognized in comparison no fault. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This is valid also for Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of an amount of $ 20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The President of NCUA Debbie Matz was allowed concessions from the two banks. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the US and it is involved in bankruptcy, to protect customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred billions of dollars. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Agreements comparisons now are the first in their genre. </seg>
<seg id="784"> The regulator also took other big banks in part and in the summer he assigned before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> With regard to the issue of mortgage documents he is &quot;Mortgage-backed Securities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Credit houses are in the base. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal to a large number of bank companies. </seg>
<seg id="788"> In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Lehman Brothers Investment Bank collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Even if the events are already a few years old, at the present time it blows on us banks a storm wind. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and supervisory authorities commenced numerous action for compensation or to punish breaches. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints. </seg>
<seg id="792"> She criticized 18 large international banks, to the two real estate financial d &quot;American State Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s&quot; be benefited in kind in cases of mortgage of about $ 200 billion. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Deutsche Bank also must file an appeal with the FHFA, he is several operations a total of 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Surveillance authorities require that the Frankfurter responds &quot;substantial losses&quot; but however without quote a sum said. </seg>

<seg id="800"> He however read the reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He already had the understanding much earlier that IBM offers most of the services and computer systems for other companies it sectors. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment by Warren Buffett is considered an attack of Knight in the world of finance. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Therefore the activity it IBM grants the right to now call &quot;Mr IBM&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="804"> Because Buffett revealed today at l &quot;economic programme CNBC, that he purchased since March of the IBM with a value of $ 10.7 billion shares.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="808"> &quot;You have done a super job,&quot; said Buffett strategically. </seg>
<seg id="809"> &quot;IBM developed for some time on the lucrative it services as qu&quot; operating accounting centres. </seg>

<seg id="817"> This is why it is a figure of worship for many investors around the world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Its almost unerring sense direction to earn money earned him the nickname of &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the announcement of Buffett investment IBM shares rose one percent on the stock exchange. </seg>

<seg id="821"> At Microsoft, said Buffett, he would not participate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is palpable </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &quot;Zwickauer cell&quot; Turkish media are doubtful about the State of German law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper spoke of &quot;bloody ideology&quot;, that rally now. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context. </seg>
<seg id="827"> Following this news, the Turkey and the German population reacts with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for a lot of germano-turcs spectrum believed dead for a long time again appeared: since the attacks incendiary of Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there was more violence comparable with this extremist context of right against the Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> There is in Germany a xenophobia, he yet never was question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The extremist right-wing network that was detected however shows proportions which the dimension is far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;Is this a return to the bloody ideology&quot;, &quot;Such was the title of the publication on the internet of the Turkish&quot;Haberturk&quot;daily.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; stressed however that one of the authors was a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the quagmire of the far-right. </seg>
<seg id="833"> It is reasoned manner that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence to the Brandenburg Gate. </seg>
<seg id="834"> It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and Turkish and German politicians had thought about a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement. </seg>
<seg id="835"> It is with cheerful colors that cohabitation was put in scene, symbolizing a success story. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Some Turkish media reports are the effect of a slap in the face: &quot;the gift of the Germany for the fiftieth anniversary&quot; is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - &quot;Haber X&quot;, which refers to the context of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the German release of &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not deprive of unambiguous conditions. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;it&apos;s starting to puer&quot;, is the title of the Chronicle of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He pointed out that people were murdered, would have paid taxes and would have made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of the Germany by their work. </seg>
<seg id="840"> The action of the police was seen very critically on the criminal forums and they were subsequently discussed the success of their research. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why he did not already came much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to search in some circles suspect of the far right, the authors are surprised. </seg>
<seg id="842"> More than one is ready at least rhetorical means or even drastic: &quot;If the case continues to be botched, it remain to migrants nothing other than self-defence and arms&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;it will be much the better self-defense&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;Inner peace in Germany depends strongly quality information and the relevance of the punishment of the network&quot;, written &quot;Help-wanted&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What it means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s were well explained. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is firmly anchored in German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event has shown more clearly the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, what the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks have however honed sense of we in the Turkish community. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Never repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> Once it is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how much taxes produced the local Turkish population. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current Turkish media report shows once more how the mistrust of many Germano-turcs is deep to l &quot;State of local law since that date.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and reassessment of the far-right in Germany terrorism, a clear message is this above necessary time. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal of the Lake of Zürich </seg>
<seg id="856"> Europe&apos;s most adventurous Bank is not in Italy or in France, but Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS went bankrupt almost in the financial crisis and patina Meanwhile of a crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It is a German to lead now. </seg>
<seg id="859"> This is certainly not what Axel s Weber &quot;was imagined.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank. There was knowledge in July, that it would be in 2013 almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Bank UBS - a key step toward an unexpected and lucrative career. </seg>

<seg id="862"> &quot;UBS has managed the Turnaround&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I welcome the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> And yet, as of September it was clear that everything had changed. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A merchant of securities of UBS in London had diverted all the Bank&apos;s security systems and had singed approximately 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well known not only in Switzerland, banker had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS is regarded since as suffering - and all ask: when Axel Weber is finally? </seg>
<seg id="868"> We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the Bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will resume the Chair of Directors already in may - not not in 2013, as provided it the Bank Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber it becomes difficult. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not banker, much more Professor d &quot;economy and President of the Bank, and he certainly needed a period of adaptation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Suddenly he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a Bank, just to prove once again that it has long deserved the title of &quot;largest bank scandal in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Indeed, UBS is a huge side - until recently, it was the largest manager of assets in the world, and on the other, it patina over the years of one scandal to another. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, but saves the so proud Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> This began during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss assets, silent and strong, but also shrewd handler, it had combined it with ambitious targets: She also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Therefore UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $ 1.6 billion more money from one wealthy clientele that any other Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, it had advanced as the investment bank with the largest banks of the World League. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Done printing. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of Bank for many years in Zurich says: &quot;I have always taken as a model of good Bank UBS to my students.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;In the current context, we wonder: how I could have simply it is safe at this point?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He is profoundly wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something turning wrong at UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of President Peter Wuffli withdrew in surprising ways, which was previously considered a high intellectual and a great banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later approached on why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The division of the Bank had singed with sub-prime documents and has of making a cross on billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it. </seg>
<seg id="889"> To do this she actually found investors, but that, shortly before, would frown eyebrows: a background of about Asian State from Singapore and a background of Arab State, which was ignored, to the point that one has never learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This n &quot;was yet as the first shot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 that it is worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The Bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second Board of Directors the better paid Switzerland, withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank bought at UBS of tens of billions of problematic titles, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which she could become a co-owner of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The Switzerland was rocked - because she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country to shelter if large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the total of the balance sheet of UBS 2007 s &quot;raised more than five times the economic performance of the Switzerland (see chart).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We could not save UBS once again&quot;, says investigator of banks, Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> After the first disaster he followed the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already a few months before, UBS had surrendered because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish data from the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the tax authorities may with the help of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she accepted a payment of $ 780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with a plus fine. </seg>
<seg id="901"> So UBS issued more or less that it had assisted tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time it has lost something which has always been its capital in competition with rich clients: the prestige of the discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal secret Swiss Bank was more the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of clients &apos; money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> The Bank had lost in a few months his credibility in the two main areas of case: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management through support to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, as there were somewhat a return to calm, and as it was thought that UBS recovered, he followed in this unhappy history of merchants of title: a single merchant title flaming EUR 1.7 billion, before the Bank not to knowledge that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And we publish: with investment bank risk management it seems still not work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli, could see that risk too little control changed&quot;, said Martin Janssen, Economist and Professor of finance at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> As the Financial Director of a major German bank is sure: &quot;the problem of UBS is that it is not the control of risk in hand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> However this was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss Bankers had long since taken their function, that of becoming guardian of the large fortune of the world: not too big risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the alpine Republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability as Sprüngli and Lindt are for a particularly noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Central to UBS in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid snapshot of the private Swiss Bank - it is only a little greater. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich central station, which leads directly from the central station to the Lake of Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings are here prestigious, rents of shops are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers like Tiffany&apos;s, found here between stores like Swiss traditions of Sprüngli confectionery. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries the Swiss Bankers have resided here: National Bank through the Palace of the Switzerland credit to elite private banks like Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> You arrive in the lobby of UBS by a heavy door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are coated with marble, to lie with thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the Bank, a large label for &quot;safe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the client search here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss Bank one day or the other removed from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and the credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, eventually as all Swiss Bankers it does business also with the two large banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS would have become far too large, find - you-especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-saxons would also spread. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss there would be nothing to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And even so, they are are long adapted to the ways of the Anglo-saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank UBS has changed, it has made high profits and then the collapse: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of the sub-prime as the great Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;On Wednesday the Government coalition of the small countries to the seven million people began the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation&quot;, wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;UBS crash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> With up to 68 billion francs about, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the great Bank bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If we speak with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 two of three major Swiss banks have concluded together a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank was created, which was already too large for the small Switzerland - and constantly registered an increase. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What has helped, it is that the two different prédécesseuses banks of UBS were completed: a Bank, but in lethargy with as fort in Zurich asset management and a poorer, but certainly more highly internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, international investment banks have favorably had access to lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 head of the group, UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel was a dream team,&quot; said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the modest great intellectual, which means very well in models and statistical, and Ospel, the intuitive, which made their way to the top with the learning of the Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel would be on until &quot;at the end to Wuffli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="941"> And wuffli would have probably committed a decisive error at the end: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;It is a tragic fall.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> UBS staff remembers clearly meetings of leaders in which the Wuffli Chief always pronounced the same watchword: dethrone Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The US Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It commissioned the &quot;League Tables&quot; rankings, which documented the success of banks at the time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> After all UBS wanted to move all in. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps have already succeeded him. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In case of currency and securities transactions it played a very important role. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Business advisors, which took responsibility, however pointed out a weakness: in the international operations of interest, the Bank &quot;Fixed Income&quot; jargon, there is a huge difference from the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS would have gaps in the level of mortgage American products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this gap, UBS launched on an adventure, which almost cost her life. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Thirsty growth, it is both the Bank itself that a management background created before it in the American sub-prime investments that invested. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It was transformed into a massive machine that packaged and pass the documents of value based on us mortgages - but also retained risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks sought for a long time down. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, UBS bought there&quot;, says Geiger, the banking expert. </seg>
<seg id="958"> More euphoria is more the fall is brutal. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager after another had to leave, when put an end to the attempts proved more difficult once thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions in UBS became ejection and are bancaux far. </seg>
<seg id="961"> One who leads the Bank has an almost impossible task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a Bank, to which all business models suggested disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The Bank researcher, Geiger has an idea: put an end to the Investment Bank, concentration in the management of property, return to Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> But the Bank is not (yet) go this far. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the Investment Bank must atrophy vigorously, as this is clear until &quot;now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday the Bank Chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The Swiss of 51-year-old Italian was only assumed to be on a transitional basis when the Bank is separated with surprise of his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime, it is imposed: it must conduct sustainable business of UBS, reported Tuesday the Bank of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to bring back the Investment Bank to the status of the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It cancels 3500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS is in need of a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What does make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> &quot;These are issues as&quot; Axel Weber is certainly already asked. </seg>
<seg id="976"> He publicly said so far only that he would seek an apartment in Zurich with his wife. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The next year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> The fear of recession in Europe weighed on the American Stock Exchange </seg>
<seg id="979"> The threat of a recession in Europe at the weekend discouraged American investors. </seg>

<seg id="993"> American investors are expressed in a skeptical way: &quot;We are not an island, by however dependent,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman management. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe will not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, did confirm this caution: &quot;is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis&quot;, at - he said in an interview with CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in bonds from the States and European banks. </seg>

<seg id="1012"> Smart crows spread in cities </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places, and rooks are considered as &quot;problem of birds °&quot; but experts say that these highly intelligent animals leave more hunt cities for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Some like, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents multiply dirt and noise of animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> An antidote against the ° problem of birds is not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> At the first symposium on crows ostfriesische, experts have said that it is no longer possible to hunt the rooks of the cities. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The Germany experts deliberated on possible solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They seek alternatives in the cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Protectors of nature based the problems of the cities on the exodus of the especially protected rooks: the use of chemicals in agriculture to destroy more traditional vital spaces. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Typical hunting, development and the felling of trees of brooding made life difficult for birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows are under the protection of the nature. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of brooding in the westfälischen Soest, in the Northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In 2005, a controversial project had earned negative advertisements because of the killing of crows in this region. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal clubs. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;The normal expulsion, the bumping, useless&quot;, found the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The destruction of nests using water pressure or well cut trees, often produces adverse consequences, told the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser of Lahr Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;The animals away, large colonies are divided and they disperse in other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> L &quot;bumping is conceivable in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We find ourselves forced to live with them, we cannot exterminate them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> The problem does not leave to resolve in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, from the opinion of the Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to include packaging and eye-catching offers, enabling them to relocate elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Psychologist and Ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens material &quot;in place of chain saws info panels&quot; completely different relationship with the: &quot;Finally we can better withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-path-educational of the Schleswig-Holstein baskets, signs informing on the lives of these very intelligent rooks. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This project was in the meantime adopted by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Jürgen gave his opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: &quot;This is a large number of communication, these birds that have much to say&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the rooks do not use only instruments of work to a treat but they manufacture themselves their tools as instruments of work. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Ethologists of Cambridge University tested four rooks recently, how is the intelligence of birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In an experiment, birds learned quickly that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to achieve as a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without much training, they acknowledged déterminément that a stone should have some size and shape to collapse the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second test, the crafty crows were then a stockier problem. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a vertically placed cylinder, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> The birds could not reach their loot with their beak. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, researchers had developed pieces of wire available to them. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they were fishing small bucket of the small pipe. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four rooks we succeed even from the beginning. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The new book from Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Title &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War&quot; (the beauty and the sorrow: a history intimate of the first world war), it begins with a long list of characters which greenhouse you the heart. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> A Board to begin: tear this page carefully and make your mark-page. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You will learn about these people in detail. In this fictional account of Peter Englund, the list of characters will be your GPS, a tag in the course of these few moments where, as one of its men and women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> He is also the new permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He wrote here a book out of the ordinary that he described accurately, as &quot;a work of anti-histoire.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It has a few known names, major treaties or the famous battles. There is almost &apos; no Ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is not so much a book about what happened, he explained, as a &quot;book describing what this could look like&quot;. There are &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and the sorrow&quot; summarizes experiences in wartime of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists of Bedouins, passing by physicians, paramedics and vendors. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become crazy, or lose life. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives reeling here as the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, were again new. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book of Peter Englund departs from the traditional history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> He brings a denial to the idea that the first world war is just by the terrible war of the trenches on the Western front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and the sorrow&quot; describes skilfully other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The troops in this book are found in hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are a defiant problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This book is moving as soon as the first page. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war invaded the lives of these people such a natural disaster, such a Hurricane Katrina which stinks cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When gun shots echoed in the distance, and you are a mother in the home, you stay or flee you? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Which will come from anyway? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> According to Peter Englund, &quot;lack of facts has been further developed by assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and the sorrow&quot; following individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a nurse English in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other documents already published. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Versions of their lives can be frightening or exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small times and isolated details. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Most address the deprivation and the ability to get out. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: &quot;Ersatz, ersatz everywhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Replacement coffee, forged aluminum, rubber imitation, bandages, paper, buttons wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He continued on the Germany replacement food. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes of the &quot;meat made of crushed cooked rice in the fat of sheep (and finished with a false bone wood);&quot; tobacco manufactured with dry roots and dried skin of potato; &quot;of the wooden shoe soles.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> He says that &quot;837 meat of substitution allowed are recorded in the production of sausages.&quot; &quot;There also 511 coffee substitution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some of the stories address the honour and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes its own pulse to savagery and said about the war: &quot;you feel that after all, is what the men were intended, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead claim that the varnish is synonymous with civilization&quot;, and that there is no barbarian behind your shirt burdened by strongly held and cloutée. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier is likely to die, and that person does the notice or not to pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When one is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public&quot; he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to &quot;a condemned man strangled in secret&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition&quot; wrote Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It captures the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass well articulated and satisfied ideologically, well pruned clothing, running his beef while being seated behind a counter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People Act unexpectedly; There are so many basic behaviors of heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Peter Englund spoke of soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;&quot; Found the phrase the more grotesque in trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers purchase and s&quot;spread on the genitals in the hope of end to the hospital&quot;, he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;The more desperate to it apply on the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to its task of humanity. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes, it captures the way in which the war has &quot;triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are starting to ask why their leaders make them a war. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books on the first world war are often indirect, as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (the great war and modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or &quot;West nothing new&quot;, Erich Maria remark, rather than complete. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The work of Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictionnelle work. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I do the révélerai. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had arisen from his book, your hands before this page that shows the list of persons and burned with a match. </seg>

<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came in the Park during the day, as migrants. An hour in the morning was a suitable schedule. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate when the Park had the least amount of people&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Vehicles of emergency services with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin d. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> Messages recorded resounding from speakers and lights appeared to intimidate demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their blue Windbreakers clear, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> No tent no hit before 1: 45 has said the Police, leaving time for occupants to gather their business. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists present in the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul j. Browne, the Police Department&apos;s chief spokesman, said that the measure had been taken only by security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But from many journalists, Police them would have to observe the intervention within the Park&apos;s roughly selected by the officers. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that the trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the West side of the Park, were able to capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> While the Police moved westward through the thick tangle of cases of demonstrators, including baggage, grass in plastic and leaf bags filled with clothing, the Department of sanitation teams followed, cleaning all the occupants left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> A few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images have been disseminated on the Internet shortly after. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of camp, not far from the centre of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp clung together. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Finally, two people are are chained to trees, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Emergency services were called to cut the lock. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrest occurred in the park before 3: 30 said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> According to Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> According Mr. Browne, 142 people were arrested in the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> most for &quot;disorder to order public and rebellion&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Joseph j. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the officer more senior s &quot;be found on the scene.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil t. Pulaski, the head of the Department of the detectives, was also present. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, although present, &quot;was not the operations&quot; said Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of police patientaient along the side East of the Park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, for necessary intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the Park, as well as Pine Street, to the South. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even seen to push people away. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> About 28 people were on the north side. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the warmest of the night took place in the South of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> To 5: 00, South of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the top of a Police car. Others have been seen puncture the tires of a Police truck. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point, a piece of plywood arose by stealing from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The Union of school aid continues the city for layoffs </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The Union representing hundreds of school aid having lost their jobs last month plans to bring Wednesday a trial to the city for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools disadvantaged schoolchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the Union, the 37th District Council, in an effort to cancel the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred and seventy-two school aid, coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the city the less well paid, lost their jobs on October 7. Union leaders have compared these dismissals to retaliation policy for not letting the city access to a Fund for health care led by groups of workers, and to close the gap of budget last spring. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council last month, the Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Board responded, mentioning that the dismissals of the aid school n &quot;were not specified in the budget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The officers of the 37th District Council reported that they serve a notice of claim, warning the Department of education that he would be prosecuted. a press conference will be organized on Wednesday to formally announce lawsuit to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of l &quot;education of the city will be the defendant.&quot; The complainants will be represented by eight workers laid off, all black and Latin American origin, as most of the school aid who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the municipality could not yet see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> For after a draft complaints obtained by the New York Times, the Union would leverage the number of redundancies in the schools in the most disadvantaged areas of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying schools poor lose more aid because a regular underfunding. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> While there are no termination on Staten Island, and a few in the settlements of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid have lost their job in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern districts of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employees at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of students live in poverty, the prosecution say that &quot;this is not a neighbourhood of affluent parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> L budget &quot;public school 36 was reduced from 3,26% this year.&quot; Funds have also been lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each entry d &quot;student.&quot; disadvantaged </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The Union also says that the directors of schools could be misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo employed the term &quot;overflow&quot; to describe the action, even if &quot;overflow&quot; more generally describes the action to move a teacher of a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> With after the project of complaints, &quot;sixty-six coordinators of parents have been laid off&quot;, and &quot;not only for cause of overflow&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission completed: the Congress is an agreement on the question of the Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems finally that the Republicans and Democrats have found an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> It took a successful uprising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long date Muammar Gaddafi and US involvement. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The Senate Foreign relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, supported by the Chairman John Kerry (Democrat — Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph i. Lieberman (independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said John Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is a bipartisan support democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language is perhaps harmless but the debate on the Libya has never been simple so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, lawmakers of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the mission of NATO in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the use of U.S. military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The Bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never the subject of a vote in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day of the failure of the Bill, the Chamber of deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of us operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The United States mission therefore remained a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough for to cut the grass under the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The indecision of the Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate can now act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee of foreign relations &quot;congratulates the Libyan people for extraordinary courage and determination for freedom&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the armed forces American and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their great courage and professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also said &quot;the national interests of the United States to reach a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measure will she win the support of the Commission of Foreign Affairs of the Senate or be it divided legislators as in June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The Senator and President of the Board Richard d. Lugar (independent) objected to the latest version. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> His spokesman said Monday that Richard d. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> In the Capitol, the House must vote this week a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congressional Republicans, and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte, Virginia, will be the first on the budget, or any other issue constitutional amendment, to obtain a vote of floor in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments but it is not without trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlatte amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been presented to Congress, on a wide range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are recurring - the same proposed legislation both in the House and in the Senate--and others are slight variations of a precedent. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and an another handle that &quot;control federal spending&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who wish to gild their CV - the chance to boast to be &quot;author&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Act on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August requested the vote of the House and the Senate on the balanced budget amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 Senators it voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can be used, while José e. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to raise the limit of two terms for Presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Jesse l. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as the amendment banning the desecration of the flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal law if two thirds of the States are opposed. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Hungry that were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed amendments 77, and introduced the 110e 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace slows down by report early 1990, when members generally more than 150 proposed amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But these amendments did not have much more success than they have today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Massacrée but not beaten,&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords during her first interview television since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman shot him on it at point-blank in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared Monday in a broadcast television, sang &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; of Broadway and said before to want everything to recover rather that return to the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In his appearance in the journal television &quot;&quot; 20/20 on the ABC channel, to the side of Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> L &quot;program has addressed his difficult return from the ball that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of representatives to vote the text relating to the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In her first interview television since the shooting in January, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and Sung - and described his recovery of &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, responded &quot;rather well&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special one-hour Edition of &quot;20/20&quot;, broadcast on the eve of the release of the new book entitled couple &quot;Gabby: a story of courage and hope&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> L &quot;special traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, we see him on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on the front. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She is to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors to learn how to perform simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A sign of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A movement of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And finally, his first word: &quot;What&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&quot;Toast&quot;) asking to change the menu of breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords recovery: we can see the representative singing with physicians air of Cyndi Lauper &quot;Girls Wanna Have Fun&quot;and Tom Petty &quot;Free Fallin&quot;?&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, happening every day two hours with doctors, said did not remember the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> According to her husband, he was to read an article on the shooting on 12 March when it was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously Treaty pending the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;There were many dead&quot; Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said &quot;I have been beaten.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;&quot; So I would say, &quot;Gabby, you have not been beaten&quot;, said Mark Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just been massacred. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you&apos;re going to you out, restore you and return even more strong than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> More mercy than of respect for troops </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event: a gala to Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for Veterans homeless in the city of New York. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad on the powerlessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The suit and tie crowd is being standing at his feet to acclaim him. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The military men and women, are regarded as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, organizing the fundraising of the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A top-ranking officer present military at the gala, which was also Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief &quot;of the armed forces of the United States staff, saw the role of troops in a different way.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They have been presented as a kind of orphan&quot;, the top-ranking member wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it &quot;was not respected.&quot; Just of pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that are installed between the military and an American public passionate but often remote. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Praise are provided to the troops for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But they have a certain price, say a few soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is more and more as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all the victims&quot; said brigadier general Sean b. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for the Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it would seem that the only way to support us is to trap us in the role of unlucky spirits.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> It is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not seem not grateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also realize that the wrath of the revenantes troops of the Viet Nam war was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Thus, most conversations in pity take place in confidence among veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, colonel retired Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some looked with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and have traveled to far away. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would ask is if &quot;a veteran in anger and violent is hiding under the surface&quot; says Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some individuals who him pass the interviews requested subtly if he would be able to take the move under the stress of a job requiring to Washington immediately after his return from combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you are the subject of the service, you encounter negative impressions&quot;, said colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference toward the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Victories are rarely welcomed by a country as unfamiliar with the army it has little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation, we do value more the heroism of the same way that for the second world war&quot; said the retired General lieutenant David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of the suffering of a member. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops are known for the number of periods of services endured, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army growing pressure to crack down against rapists </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a capital hearing will decide if 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for an inaction assumed concerning rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare for the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier of 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks at night where she says she was raped by a soldier. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> C &quot;was in October 2008.&quot; It returned to its barracks at Miramar Air Station, North of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her if he could join her in her room to have a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;&quot; C&quot;was a wake-up call,&quot; said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the well has set aside its concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, 19 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is Texas,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I have to follow my intuition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after being entered in the House of Elizabeth Lyman, the man grabbed him by behind, thrown on the ground and raped, she argues. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, will be November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other members, some still in service and others not, waiting with anxiety the decision of justice at a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and that will decide if a trial brought against former defence Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The latter are accused of would not have stopped the generalization of rape in the military, contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial involved initially 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 months - 3 men and 25 women, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also argue that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided justice adapted after the alleged attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Susan Burke said taking on the military galonnées, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a vertical structure,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the individuals in position d&quot; eradicate the culture of retaliation? &quot;Leaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Counsel also States that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most could be part of future legal proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Strategy: instead of all the complainants in this case — thus putting all its eggs in one basket - it will demonstrate several trials, if necessary, to keep up the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by American counsel Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Court documents obtained by Newsweek, detail of the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to a decision in 1950 of the Supreme Court, known as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The wrong alleged is inherent in military service of the complainants&quot; indicate the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense has refused to make any comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women have not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is registered only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play a role more important, to come into contact with local women. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Result: two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two-thirds in combat. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the army to modernize said Susan Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in fighting this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to its own. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> A l &quot;Yale Law School, the Veterans legal services centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for supposedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, non profit Viet Nam Veterans of America Foundation is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on diagnostics of &quot;personality disorders&quot;, attributed to the rape victims to give them leave - a fact relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of Service Women&apos;s Action Network (network of military women), a group for human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group has sued in December to the Administration of veterans, by accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to handle requests for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine independent bills each other were presented to the Congress by a bipartisan mix of Senators and representatives, offering various solutions. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded from the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, from the own estimate of the Pentagon, this ce chiffre figure represents approximately 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents this year there. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report published in March also studied the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases in the army were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The complainants in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the fact. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she said, he was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to different police, physicians and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She suffered a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a rape kit), and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge at a trial in which are the questions on his sexual relations with her boyfriend more early the day of the assault. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, which eventually be acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was returned&quot; said Elizabeth Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to begin to have contractions.&quot; &quot;I began yelling at the Court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I have been placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I am out, I remember saying to my commanding officer&quot;Was not his trial but my&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, it was returned under terms less than honourable, preventing them from receiving any advantage. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> What is the case of Lyman and other complainants will advance or not, it is a long history, said John Turley, Professor of law at the Faculty of law of the University of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, he points out, &quot;in my opinion, they should be able to move forward&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Only the doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have always criticized the Feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it has not the same benefits and deterrent posed by the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try to,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things only change when the Bills have the will to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the trial is not running in their favour, Susan Burke, counsel for the complainants, will bring together hundreds of other complainants to other trial. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there will be no reform&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Where until &quot;what we were, one or the other of the two options.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy showing his anti-immigration online opinions. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Monday, Breivik, who admitted to have been taken of a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik has acted alone, it would be on Cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on its computer, to talk to some of the millions of nationalists who support groups of the far right on the social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to learn more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy... Connect to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;&quot; We realized that it n &quot;was not so difficult as it find them&quot;, said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the reflection group of DEMOS on digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find people that they were searching with scientific precision - the way in which marketers have for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> L &quot;team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half a million members are fans of the groups of the extreme right in Europe.&quot; It has targeted with advertisements, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product ads invite users to respond to a survey. Questions related to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> By entering in contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were questioning 10,000 supporters of 14 Parties of the far right in 11 European countries - without leaving the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a new way of doing research,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not at all surprising: supporters of the right-wing groups online are rather young men and against immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But surprisingly, &quot;those that combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> L &quot;study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Focus groups, medical researchers and scientists use the site to study all subjects affecting health issues as social trends, the &quot;I like&quot;, publications on the walls and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, &quot;supernova of data&quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research with the site name appears in the title of almost 800% over the past five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you could not approach the streets. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you tried to conduct investigations on persons of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You had to go to the party, but they would have never allowed you to enter,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and address the health and social problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> According to a recent study by the d. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploits while intoxicated had lot more likely to be alcoholic as discrete students in this regard. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Megan Moreno suggested that colleagues of the students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and would intervene to help any student whose status speak too often alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You cannot treat a problem if you do not diagnose&quot;, Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and Director of the Center for health, behavior and development of children at the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and that would be in another not recognized.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> L &quot;team of the site dealing with the data studied statistics the love situation and the day of Valentine&apos;s day, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to the only available information - champions digital freedom have long argued that the site could make his Treasury of data available to others for research purposes).&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that site occur, only that they like or non - Exchange to play Scrabble with a friend which is thousands of kilometres, the site is authorized to access your information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when users of Facebook are part of an investigation which they have even not heard? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have much guidance defined on how to gather the information otherwise via the Internet, it is anything else online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can examine their profile&quot; says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the laboratory of knowledge in London, according to a 2006 study that he conducted by observing the students Facebook walls. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they know, exchanges have were seen by their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then comes the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do in the real world are two completely different things,&quot; says Neil Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite her experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn think that a Notepad and a pen are the best tools to use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with people,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social studies are intended to address the social aspect - and social, it is not a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted having organized the two attacks which left 77 dead in Norway this summer, described himself as a veteran &quot;of the resistance&quot; during his first appearance at the trial which takes place in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance and the Templars of Norway movement,&quot; he said before a packed courtroom of 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;With respect to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, I objects, because you keep your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I recognize the facts but I plead not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> J. Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he &quot;did not want to give the opportunity to use this trial to express their opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talking to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> J. Nesheim also asked Police to keep Breivik detained twelve weeks more, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and he was warned that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended the hearing to see the end of the trial. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought it was cold and inhuman&quot; said a survivor of Utoya to Norwegian television NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;&quot; I n &quot;was not comfortable, but I personally a little advanced after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik has remained calm and professional during the entire trial. He looked the journalists and the survivors in the eyes in incoming and outgoing of the tribunal. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of &quot;resistance&quot;, the judge determined that he was not mad. He also stated that there is no evidence that there is with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may bring some. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by any nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I will have preferred that he looks like a monster, but this is not the case,&quot; said a relative of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would have been much easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons from the interview, Steve Jobs, lost at the cinema this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by technical and inventor of modern computer engineering. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs was found recently and which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the major markets, is how this creative spirit understood the process and workflow products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. It identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, and a breeding organization charts - a man who believed that many leaders of businesses suffered from a &quot;disease of suggesting them that a great idea done 90% of the work...&quot; &quot;[but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea of a product of exception.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; television series. The series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer business NeXT to people&apos;s adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, it said that main copies have been lost in transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the Director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This video, slightly bulging, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs appears here surprisingly enthusiastic to expose technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly attentive. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> On four different points during the interview responses come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs clear thoughts, to provide a precise answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Found also moments where the perfectionism of Steve Jobs re-emerges, where he seems eager to hear Cringely, issues him kicking elbow to accelerate and pass questions or topics of utmost importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before &quot;era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, is a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview.&quot; Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and expressed its own vision on the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something crude and inspiring on the man that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of the magnitude. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision on how things can be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> He explained and then dishes on implementation. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On the way he learned to conduct of business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;&quot; During all these years, I have always asked: &apos; why do you do things? &quot;and the answers are always the same: &apos; oh, simply because to be.&apos;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why, nobody does reflects deep things in a business. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> This is what I discovered. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Steve Jobs continues giving details on its efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Puzzled as to how the costs were recorded - it starts often with a &quot;standard cost&quot; rated view of nose, and then adjusted with a &quot;variation&quot; - he has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of the business costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the opportunity to play a round with the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;box blue&quot; he created with Steve Wozniak - a device which was used to hack telephone networks and make free long-distance. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The aircraft has been the object of numerous writings in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the blue box as an act of appropriation is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He described how he and Wozniak have tested the box using a public telephone, passing a call and then connecting a network AT &amp;amp;amp;amp; T in an another whole, bypassing as many satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We enveloppions the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you hurliez in the public phone and it came you a minute later to the public phone next,&quot; laughs Jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and thanks to this blue box, we learned that we could ourselves create something able to control billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We know very little both, but we have been able to invent something small, capable of controlling great things. It was an amazing lesson, and I do not think that Apple would have existed without this someday. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak were developed: he called the Vatican with the blue box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in mad laugh just prior to the Pope himself is awakened. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On her love with the technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> A l &quot;age of 12, hunting parts spare for a frequency counter, he seeks the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and passes a call.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets part-time summer Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;This has had a remarkable influence on me.&quot; C &quot;was the only company that I had seen at this age and this formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of employees HP to visit the laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the &quot;first computer ever Office.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big a suitcase, owned a small cathode ray tube. I to am fell in love. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> The young person than j &quot;was returned at HP and began writing programs for this machine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvisation of innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, while he moved to sell a few circuit boards, a client asked to assemble a complete computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to deal with the Assembly as well as the delivery of finished products. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties to develop computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember large disputes... on screaming me on it by claiming that I would have five years [to make a mouse which would cost $300].&quot; &quot;I have had enough, I went out and went to see a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could manufacture for $15 and that was incredibly reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies that faltering: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Well before that it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and lose control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Admit that you were working in IBM or Xerox, you a best copier or a better printer, and after?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market, so the company meeting not more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing can make evolve, so [what are these types of people] that ultimately lead businesses and product staff are being l &quot;gap of decisions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine design a good product from a bad product - required manual work. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This is what occurred at Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could hold any of the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It might have done ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have torn off the defeat to victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea of an extraordinary product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn heavily on its subtleties. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are trade-offs to make... Some things you can not do, the electrons are glass, robots, factories as well. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) assembling the each other. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. He is trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We still have shame of stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> It is in part what makes exceptional Macintosh. Those who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, which merely proved the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If this is for computer science, they have done extraordinary things in another area. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the right to health while the Court meets </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day where the Supreme Court meets in camera to examine the issue of political discord, that is if the opposition to President Obama of the Health Act will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, was noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm who will defend the case in the High Court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a Conference to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question concerned a lawsuit filed by 26 States challenging the reform of ambitious healthcare passed by Congress last year, an act which was a rallying point for conservative activists across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The justices agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental from 5: 30 is expected next March, and the result will probably be to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at the time where the decision of the Court will be rendered. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Counsel to be held before the Court, argued on the rejection of the Act, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George w. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was part of two dozens of firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society (Federalist Society), a group of long time dedicated to defend the conservative principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of independent businesses (National Federation of Independent Business). </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another proponent was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held in a Washington Hotel a few hours after the Conference of the tribunal on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican top and opponent said of the Health Act. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Featured dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, judges are exempted from code of conduct which governs the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they argumenteraient by the code of Canon 4 c, which States: &quot;A judge may attend fundraising of the law-related organizations and other property that the judge cannot be a player, a guest of honour, or on the programme of this event&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms of the case, as well as a company with a solid financial interest, was enough to alarm the Government Ethics activists. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other judges Federal&quot;, said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were drinking and were having dinner and a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the Court&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and their participation in the event fundraising dismounts any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism saying that they too easily mix business of the Court with the agenda of groups such as the federalist society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, the Conservatives argue that it is justice Elena Kagan that has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was Solicitor General of the administration of Obama when the first objections to the Act were brought to the level of the Court of first instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Critics have lobbied that Kagan rejects to hear the case, saying that she has was too involved in the defence of the Act to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan gave no indication that it would. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing records record order from 18 billion dollars to airliners </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The airline Emirates order 50 Boeing 777 aircraft line bi-couloirs, with the option to buy 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than$ 1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives a command looking at 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> On the other hand is a case where the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reached the record sum of $ 18 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> All incredible is that Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2 520 aircraft worth a total of $ 450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Over the weekend, Boeing advised commercial aircraft order the most expensive in history-50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai who has spent this pharaonic command. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Boeing announced the Dubai Aerospace show of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 aircraft, which would be $ 26 billion the total amount of the order. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model which boasts significant savings of fuel and amenities for passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The amount of these six devices s &quot;amounts to more than a billion dollars.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, the Morningstar analyst. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;These clients in particular have a tremendous value.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> The Middle East oil-producing countries have many of their airlines. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> They have therefore not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - harmful habit for airlines as it represents costs the most important - they would not so harmful because the country would gain money with the rise of the oil price. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is an important point because these companies are less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, reported Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural coverage of risk&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The Emirates order reinforces the dominance of Boeing aircraft Airbus widebody and help to curb the attempt of encroachment of the Airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft market. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of Boeing in the air show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the beginning of the larger version of the A350, which directly competes with the Boeing 777 - 300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Airbus pushes his debut to increase the thrust the request of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The Boeing Company shares have increased 1.5% to 67,94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The sister of Mexican President clearly beaten in the election of the Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of PRI in the race for Governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its attempt to access the functions of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and it said Monday that drug traffickers helped one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of party revolutionary institutional, or PRI, was leading the race to the position of Governor of this State from the West. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the process of voting and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the entire country,&quot; reported Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio in an interview on the Monday following the elections. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They have threatened our candidates, our electoral officers...&quot; &quot;They grabbed the ballot box, set up roadblocks... and have forced people to vote&quot; for the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI has governed the Mexico for seventy years until &quot;losing the Presidency in 2000.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But he organized his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes win l &quot;presidential election in July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo appears to be unmarked little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before the election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognize Vallejo as winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, candidate of left of the Party of the revolution democratic, or PRD, which is currently the Governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidential election of 2012 for this left divided and unhappy. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to recognize the results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former Mayor of Morelia, the capital of l &quot;State, denied any link with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1720"> The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels specialize in trafficking marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is l &quot;State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1722"> However, the violence persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A week before the election a mayor of the PAN was murdered while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have given locally to the campaign for fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> However, for the PRI, also corrupt that the elections of the Michoacán have air, a victory will party in momentum. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and stated, &quot;I think that this victory is very encouraging for the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> ADB urged the upcoming Asia help the euro area </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank has applied to the India and China prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a decrease in the long term to prevent the development of l &quot;Asian economy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, the Director General of the Manila-based ADB said that both the fastest of the world economic powers should &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to speed up the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He has advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) look at the difficulties of Europe with a &quot;reckless eye&quot; and reported that Asian financial support to the sides of the leaders and resources of Europe would d &quot;avoid a collapse in the long term of l&quot; global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all together in this crisis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;&quot; Asia may be protected until &quot;at some point but it is not safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and the India can help, that there is nothing to prevent them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> The last few months, the euro area has been badly tarnished by a sovereign debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Recently, the cost of the Italian debt is dangerously soared and Italy and Greece first Ministers resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has been emergence fear that l &quot;world economy fit in recession, and has been the appeal of major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area to find a solution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag has hypothesised that the IMF door any help Asian, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - as buy the obligations of Fund financial rescue of United States, the European financial stability Fund - provided more power to the Asian partners of Europe negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, India&apos;s Minister of Commerce and industry, said that &apos;the India do everything it can&quot;to help the euro area since its own economy now suffers from a declining exports and a depletion of the influx of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;No one wants that the euro zone remains unstable and agitated&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We face monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that the savings in development such as the India should not help the European rich while they face their own significant economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept assistance to Europe 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800,000 live on $ 2 a day, or even less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;One day, they discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the Sun and they will have difficulty in swallowing,&quot; he reported. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why the reserves of the India should be used to maintain many Greek staff well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone could cause &quot;significant impacts&quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The forecast of the ADB to economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face &quot;of the risk of loss&quot; because of the European threat. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed d &quot;develop&quot; contingency plans&quot;to guard against an economic downturn and serious leaks of capital.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Severe warnings from the Pentagon on the potential reductions of defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, raises pressure on Congress Monday, warning that imminent automatic cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a chain reaction financial of the corridors of the Pentagon in the fields of battle of the Afghanistan, through the raising of civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already digests 450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional amount of $ 600 or more cuts be imminent if the Congress does not reach agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the Ministry&quot;, said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in the so-called sequestration, would result in 23% of emission reductions and the freezing of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A reduction also applied, so indiscriminately, make most of our ships and our unenforceable construction projects - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or building - and serious damage to other modernization efforts,&quot; wrote Panetta to Senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We are also forced to separate us from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military personnel and would seriously damage our preparation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continuous Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although that funding in time of war of Auditors of contingency operations abroad does is not directly affected by sequestration, the war effort would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in core budgets&quot;, Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;Contracting staff is reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract to support the war&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff managing the wages would be reduced, causing delays in payment to suppliers of war, and legal and political support would be disturbed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two Senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States World undisputed military power&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are fiercely opposed to this drastic action,&quot; said senators in a release common Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter from Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;It is not a consequence with which we can live, and is certainly not one that we should impose on us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;Sequestration is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and it should not have to occur&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The Panetta letter and Senators recent warnings increase the pressure for a budget compromise or appeal to exempt the Pentagon of reductions, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta was more virulent about possible cuts, although he himself succeeded to the highest position of the Pentagon with years of expertise of the budget to the Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At last week&apos;s press conference, the Secretary of Defense has paints a picture dark of what could occur - a soldier with a shell, but not core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is a hunting aircraft, without enough trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs which do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force depressed, unprepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;De facto, it invites aggression...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has specifically stated how cuts could &quot;generate significant operational risks: deadline for response to crises, conflicts and disasters;&quot; severe limits to our ability to deploy, and engaging in the world; &quot;and unacceptable risk in future combat operations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the largest projects of defence could move to the axe, including those already tested, and some just in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list included the F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber Fighter, new generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new vehicle field, to replace the Humvee of the army and the Navy. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Put an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say that it is an essential step to improve and response to potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to spot a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the recent news indicates how deceit and falsehood are ubiquitous in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women. each side accusing the other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for having allegedly covered reports that a retired football coach boys sexually assaulted. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a microphone open stating the Barack Obama American President that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israeli was a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> The lie has destroyed careers and convulsé countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The Member of the Congress of New York and the Anthony Weiner Internet celebrity, is passed to an idiot by issuing quickly denials contradicted by irrefutable proof. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of the campaign related to the coverage of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, will any of those who lived the history never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The stories of cheating on tests of the school and the University are legion. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There were cases where teachers have given responses of testing students to do on their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors should teach otherwise send the message according to which lies and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception meet us? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On any given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> In fact, many of these are pious lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire both for personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Be a game similar to, say, charades, where the objective is to exclaim: &quot;I you have&quot;, the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that led a research in depth of such projects, including psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie was demystified. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Liars stare at you in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They do bégayent, turn red or get not always agitated. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A qualified lie detector can find the truth by examining the structure of the Declaration, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the response time. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years to examine results scientific in the wide body and still emerging knowledge about the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern jurisdiction that is easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world - especially if your responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiation or management. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are adept to read, making them comfortable, in managing their own emotions and intuitively detect how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the Extroverts lie more than introverts, men tell more lies &quot;focused on them&quot; while women say more &quot;centered on the other&quot; lies - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people less often lie to their partners that people not married (but the lies they tell tend to be huge). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a miscreant, others will feel less guilty of you lie. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell if someone lies? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, observe the normal behavior of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is what is called &quot;establish benchmarks&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You need to know if someone normally moving his feet constantly to not launch unfair charges when you can see stir the feet in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then look for signs of deceptive verbal and non-verbal behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Misleading people can stop the upper body when attempting to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, look toward an exit, change posture significantly or present a &quot;post-interview&quot; relief - a sigh exaggeration of relief, a change in posture when difficult questions are passed. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The interrogators often falsely indicate that maintenance is complete just to try to trigger the response post-interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The famous Scott Peterson skidded by using the past claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find it. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Misleading individuals can also use values language: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman...&quot; &quot;Miss Lewinsky&quot; or fully repeat a difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Can someone use a lot of &quot;language of wood&quot; in his answer to a difficult question: &quot;Eh... well to tell the truth... If I remember property... to my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization of scammers in their professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after administration of Obama has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between the Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - evoking the wrath of the unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project back on track. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the pipeline thrown from the environmentally sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The TransCanada official, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval of a pipeline, but with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal project permit until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes and the aquifer Ogallala Nebraska, of large underground water sources. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real way forward,&quot; said Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska at Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new examination of the environment controlled by the Department of State would probably delayed any decision until 2013, after the next year&apos;s elections, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a statement written last week, has described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and he expressed his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> 2,735 Km pipeline would extend from the Canada to the Mexico Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It transport 700,000 barrels per day since the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> To do this, it should be across six States. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have relied on the 20,000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan are pressure as legislation to force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The environmental impact study in the Department of State found that the project would be only a limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the Inspector General of the Department ordered an investigation separate from the review process, focusing on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represent a conflict of interest in the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is that if a company hired to conduct the initial study was a choice inappropriate because of its relationship to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child to vomit of fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says diva Patti LaBelle Disco launched in an outbreak of violence in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited in fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer frightened Geneviève Monk small age of 18 months, to the point that she suffered &quot;changes of personality, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased fear of foreigners&quot;, said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year while the scene technician Kevin Monk, his teacher wife to kindergarten children, Roseanna, and Geneviève appeared willing to go on a trip to family. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk went to get the car, Roseanna Monk came down in the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, with Geneviève in his arms. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said that it had stopped by the door and asked his daughter for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone came behind me and told me:&quot;Do you know what your daughter?&quot;&quot; &quot;I said&quot;Yes&quot;and I went to look for,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle angrily chastised the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;She told me of an aggressive tone:&quot; you should not let your daughter by the door &quot;, said Roseanna Monk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I said:&quot; what you say or think I am not interested &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became enraged and started to use language - the word &quot;&quot; and the word &quot;&quot; in a loud voice... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> She had a bottle of water and began to spraying me water from the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said to the woman:&quot; look what you did to my daughter &quot;, said the mother of the child.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle has thrown on the mother - who was still Geneviève in his arms - and had to be accepted by his entourage who has brought to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The little girl was crying if hard that she began to vomit, she adds. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Counsel and representatives of LaBelle have not returned our calls for comment. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but counsel for the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that family plans to donate all the money received to a children&apos;s cancer charity. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The purpose is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,&quot; said Mr Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable, particularly to a kindergarten teacher for a child of 18 months.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Climate adversity has slowed the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has declined, and the economy contracted </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 is a year which is remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, auto-appelé of change, which has generated great expectations in regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase was observed not, in Exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The temperatures of February in part to cause loss of trillion for the agricultural sector, have limited opportunities for the economy of the State for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified primarily by the history drop of 31.16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamism other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report of assignments by the jellies from the Mexican of sustainable rural development Council, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares grown, including a 78,03 per cent suffered damage total and the rest of 21,07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main affected crops were vegetables, corn and chickpeas. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline in economic activity has generated, November, a constant rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of statistics and geography the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year was observed an increase in accelerated, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economic Active Populationin the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to increase to the 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase over the first half of Mile 18, 969 people. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Less liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Sinaloa unemployment during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and social of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by the actions performed by public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;That there is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, between which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in the Congress to combat the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars in an illegal manner is not easy work to earn&quot;&quot;, they invest and use in something&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration held </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people who leave the State to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because typing they already have many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and there seek sources of employment, making the unemployment increase&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Lack of seriousness </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Analysis of sinaloen labour market worsens by considering the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates between working conditions, according to the INEGI, the 60,38 per cent of the population occupied in this State are working without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Share of unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason to offset for the State are low wages, the entity has the lower remuneration of the country, according to the records of the Mexican of social insurance and the Secretariat of work and forecasting social Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> The average monthly incomes of the sinaloens was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the average national, which lies 7 miles 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of FDI </seg>
<seg id="1879"> Apart from the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 recorded the highest reduction of the Foreign Direct investment of the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of economy from January to June the FDI of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 per cent from 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> In turn, the Government of the State economic development secretariat posts a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos a year, recorded primarily by companies in the tertiary sector. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> Debt </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State was sought in July at the public Conference approval of a credit of $ 3 trillion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the Congress of the State was 2,600 trillion pesos and up to November there was were no benefit of debt in any sector of the economy of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>
<seg id="1884"> For the representatives of the sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of industry, said that in 2011 was not there a harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, enclosed the Government of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work intensely to retrieve the field what we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, it took align all the effort and especially the progress already synchronized this new Government team, hope what next year is much better&quot;He said. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Economic slow </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López said that events such as frost at the beginning of the year have retained the State&apos;s economy and have restricted his performance and growth. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The low economic fluxe is produced of several events, between which jellies, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that turns fairly rapidly to generate economic dynamism which allows to have a level acceptable e stream in the trial, products and services and as a result, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations that we had&quot;He said. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Redefine the vocation </seg>
<seg id="1891"> Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the employer Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa has stated that he wants channel State into more productive activities of dynamism. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;In words General we found that it worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefined the vocation and the economic direction of the State, because it is important that it detonates the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa&quot;, he said. </seg>

<seg id="2061"> I think this is partially because we have nine disks and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose what songs interpreted each evening. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have more read for a long time, this helps us stay focused and we surprised because this us recalled the reasons why we love these songs and we can have forgotten. </seg>

<seg id="2065"> Looking back, is it difficult to believe all that you have been successful? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have for more than 20 years fact that seems a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue to make music together we émotionne lot. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we love creating music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could get better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What is for you the fact of having been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement arises with a group of friends and is common. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, a group out of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups go out at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We play again with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in the Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of this sound in Seattle that has arises. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is very strange that a group like your to continue United and with the same members for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time that many groups last normally. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, second, we care about all for others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all friends and through this musical boulevards that give freedom to each experiment there. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other with the music of each and it could not get better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the word celebrity was not easy; However, thanks to your success, you have to do what you want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We make sure that we spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of the great multitudes of people who love your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> If you forget not that people are there for the music, this help us to remember to respect music and which has made him, without head is the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which is not interested in none of us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we have written good songs and at the beginning it was magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We have been a group for almost three years and we have not published before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) disk. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laughIt was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was a surprising human being and lack us. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national group Las Robertas will open the show at Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and why you chose it for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, production has sent us videos with different proposals and this was the group that we liked the most, so we look forward to see what Las Robertas can provide live and it must be very distracting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> What change you always the words of Yello Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> It was he that sings and I think that it is doing with the first words he imagines. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bassist, what are his influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> There are so many... </seg>
<seg id="2103"> One of the first I remember there are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, v. j. Ramona, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many influences, that I could talk about all afternoon on the bassists I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How Pearl Jam has managed to maintain under grunge in spite of the fact that it is no longer fashionable? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think what we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those arises at the same time and, if it is now, I think this is wonderful because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups such as Mudhoney are now the best music ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> In the beginning, his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What is this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It&apos;s interesting, because I think that there are songs in the new album that appear to be lighter, but there songs, as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even these may sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With the two, when Ed has played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that if you grew up and there is trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that can also be happy and even like this can be obscure music. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Architects coincide on the desirability of convening beyond the controversy over fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contest on 16 doors again opened the discussion on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Mid-1980s, in full apogee of the already-extinguished Corporation Metropolitan de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed flyers for the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the Metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the Park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that focuses not on the North-South axis, if not top (mountain) - lower (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The characterization of Collserola natural park is to the benefit of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was more Central Park or Yellowstone, with a wild boar in the role of Yogi bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This was the situation until, in September, the City Hall called a mega-competition composed by 16 competition for all Collserola access doors. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door presents the idea of Park, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> It is this, or well someone wants to put doors on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question appears alone: Collserola: Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both with regard to its organization as in regard to the reflection on the city is a theme of conversation of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a recurring theme with two members of this old caste of elected representatives when they recognize in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this is just one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, University professors, who are presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;front mountain&quot; because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, of the Green blocks has not been carried out to end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;He must leave base that broader Barcelona Park is the beach.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for its accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> &quot;Collserola is more complex,&quot; gave the verdict the architect for the title of &quot;doors of Collserola&quot; contains a &quot;trap lexicon&quot;: should think of these as&quot;the access to a park, but the delimitation of areas in which action must be taken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;a few perils&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Of the perils that derive from &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of public space&quot; after the experience in the 1980s and in the area of the Forum &quot;the swan song&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the own delimitation border on which can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limit something means already establish the following step&quot;, that is, its overflow. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;He must think about new planning instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan (PGM) Plan] can cause real disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Standing over the question, Modol argues that, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles of Collserola &quot;can be heard as a park, of Barcelona, not&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola employers &quot;should not be lost&quot;, by thanking for the opportunity that the town hall to his corporation to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> It means that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; If this profile technique must run multi-disciplinary teams (&quot;all a success&quot;, said) that one has the create: &quot;We, architects, should be only an instrument&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question which gives the title of this piece is complex, because the foundations of the competition lacks a global vision of Collserola: &quot;is called 16-cutting competition - he - said in the mountain-sea sense, but there is not a longitudinal reading that way and understand the area as a whole&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> In this case, that il had opted to participate in 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, a draft for only one of the gates to shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the nearby door. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, Yes, the City Hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that performs a soft transition between the city and the green. </seg>

<seg id="2242"> &quot;In a search it is reported that there is no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact is presented in a structural manner.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transport.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The ground had a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For the moment, the Secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it can even last a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Its Tower, Gilberto López Meyer, Executive Director of airports and auxiliary Services provided that the moment of impact, the State major presidential helicopter was operating speed cruiser and happened on a bottom-up soft soil. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information supports the hypothesis of a functioning normal cruiser at the impact&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual Flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> According to the normative aeronautics, flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have the visibility during flight and on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The IMMA reports mentioned appropriate conditions on take-off, and as and as the aircraft progressed to the boundary zone between the DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low cloud cover. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely qu &quot;cloudiness conditions the crew sought a zone of lower height and more visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far to assume that the impact occurred on a trajectory straight and lateral. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The dispersion of the remains of the aircraft model allows to assume that the helicopter is hit against the ground in terms of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> It is not detected traces of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the place of loss there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the field work found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above mean sea level, the soil had a slope that goes for seven dégrées 30 degrees of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which it is is possibly disconnected along its path. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the aircraft may have had multiple impacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After careful research in an area further that the place surrounded around the accident, are not found parts dispersed of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announcement protocol to find the obesity gene </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Social insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people; This is supported by specialists in the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that he leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, called &apos;Genetics of obesity of children and adolescents&apos; that will allow to have markers associated with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a release, the head of the unit of Investigation medical biochemistry of the Hospital of the specialities of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, National Medical Center explained that it had formed a team of multidisciplinary physicians, nurses, nutritionists and assist social. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of third cycle of the National Institute of public health (INSP) and the Centre of Investigation and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Investigation are invited to participate the population having or not, to attend the sports participating units of the IMSS to Valle de México, where are the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 hours. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He pointed out that the Protocol began in the unit sports Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and as of October 8, the activity takes place in the sports unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> After reaching the objective of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the unit sports Independencia (to the South of Distrito Federal) and finally in the unit sports Morelos (North of Distrito Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this investigation and the e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the children and Mexican youth risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> As November 14, it will celebrate the world day of diabetes, he mentioned that the goal is bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the purposes of the specific food questionnaires. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> They will be also requested on their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He detailed that the Saturday it will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (sought to identify people associated with childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López reported that this investigation was the result of the concern of professionals of health for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos; Surveys of health in 1999 and 2006 reported that only six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of the 77 per cent in obesity and in the case of the daughters of the 47 per cent; regards the overweight also observed a dramatic increase &apos;, pointed out the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He indicated that the justification for the research of markers is based in the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He informed that on average, the Mexican have a 65 per cent of inheritance indo-American, a 30 per cent European and a five per cent African and this condition is reflected in the people associated with the diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in General, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn the excess energy that it consumes (calories), deposited in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The investigator explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of the children, which allows to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> ILA even said that the presence of dark (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm folds indicate the probability of suffering metabolic alterations and same pré-diabètes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is handled in a confidential manner, physicians the challenge in writing to the parents, to which it explains each of the measures and changes in lifestyle that they must make to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of going to walk short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Another cause is the high caloric intake, that is the consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - block of meat in corn flour wrapped in leaves of corn - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and analyzed genetic in this Protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the cassis </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, developing of asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mix with better performance, environmental conditions and temperature independently </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If reported them that the keypad were resolved, it would be most necessary repair approximately 200 thousand cassis each season rainfall in the metropolitan area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM (FQ), who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of bituminous pavement is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> During its Conference A technological view on blackcurrants, organized by the international year of chemistry, he announced that the laboratory is developing of asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mix with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with a higher mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Nájera Herrera at estimated that this type of modified Asphalts could be used in locations where the climate is extremely hot, as some towns in the North of the country, to improve performance, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest share of the oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and with a low molecular weight molecules, called malthènes, which together give the keypad its characteristic viscoelastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C has a State almost solid, for that at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, &apos;&apos; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day with environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The investigator of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a pad flexible, composed of six layers of materials, whose last three imply the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the small stones that form the layer, signalât, is bathed an asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When vehicles spend generating efforts, it allows that forces spread very well in the keypad. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If there was a modified asphalt, they spread better, opinât him rudimentary chemical. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the layer of asphalt, he says, put last layer called layer of bearing, fine stone, i.e., sand which is also bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicle, it must have more mechanical than the asphalt layer and provide traction on the street. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Being part of the keypad that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that it has adequate thickness and material which it is made shall be treated. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he said, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the soil is wet, water spreads within the layer is it difficult that it so, which softened all the layers of the keypad and therefore cause of cassis. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the formation of a blackcurrant trial, he said, the first to spoil is rolling film and only later is assigned the asphalt layer, but damage has no place immediately, but is a process that must be treated at the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The Member of the National system of researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another factor important to the formation of black currant and thus the thickness of each layer of the pavement must be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure satisfaction, to avoid frequent of cassis. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, that in other countries already exist on the market and allow repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> That failed in the Valle candidate to be the new miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that made that Melina Ramírez Serna did not obtain the Crown of miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle receives his number 14 of Princess title. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> New Valle del Cauca has remained with the desire to win the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time ci Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with the fact of being on the podium of the winners, wearing the Crown of money and the band it is hereby as new Princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result yesterday in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the Crown and the sceptre, the Department already sum 14 titles of Princess and Melina in a legion of women of Valle del Cauca that are found near the Crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Now the big question that many people arises is: </seg>
<seg id="2317"> What is missing? Because the result is the defeat of a favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been voted in vain Queen in the Police and best face Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took away the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the juror of the designate first Princess is the fact that it was not satisfied with his answer to the question &quot;?&quot;What was the book which marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> This is the response of the Valle candidate this question: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read many, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser is, definitely I think that the book that marked my childhood is&quot;The little prince&quot;, it is a deep enough book.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Now I read &quot;Crime and punishment&quot;, this is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called &quot;The eagerness of the blood&quot; &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> This response is not please first of all because the term &quot;culturaliser&quot; and second to not explain specifically how each cited book had marked it. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe and wise, it happens what should happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> &quot;And for everyone, read a little please,&quot;The little prince&quot;is a great book&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Between launched assumptions there is that that Valle was destroyed by patronage. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist of Bogotá suggested that being a favorite, the audiences and the candidate that received all the preliminary prices (food challenge Oster, the vote of the public for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;this has awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, has stressed the Queen and for this that she not shined on the stage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it noted this in his first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the eve of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Even if in the two parades she had appeared confident even, it noted that it did not have the strength and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;Como en casa&quot; (at home), the Canal RCN has stated that the fact that Melina had been designated Princess &quot;confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prices during the competition does not receive the Crown of Queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and this was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the National beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> This is why only two days before the election the juror international Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a committed woman with regard to the social needs of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Only the beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the competition are already involved in projects&quot;, she explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> One speculates also Valle sinned by shortcomings of his behind and fibrosis is observed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory, because precisely the Board elected him as the &apos;Natural beauty&apos; candidate with the healthy body, good nutrition and responsible for physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparer of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina was not the best body, there was at best, &quot;but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, he left points the last day&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgery she had suffered. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The surgery are good, but Valle did not do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2338"> &quot;His body was never its asset and she lost because of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this price, that the National beauty competition presents for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits a arises a cruel prediction done last night, it said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was Melina to not to give the taste of the Crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as Princess, a position which gives the possibility to represent Colombia in one of international by designation of the National competition. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, she spent in history as one of the Queens who despite his dazzling passage by Cartagena, did not have the Crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A dactyloscopiste of Cali is passed to the history as the man who confirmed the death of &apos; Alfonso Cano&apos;. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> The past November 4 a dactyloscopiste of the Cali SIC spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, by confronting his fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven dactyloscopistes working in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of &quot;availability &apos; of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2347"> Early in his career, González has worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where were the bodies which should be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> The year 2000 he has been transferred to the capital of Valle and after having attended appropriate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of skin friction, i.e. the palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano it had warned Eliazar to take with him the clothes at least for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something very large expected it. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he went for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that it suspected that one of them was that of the man who was the oldest guérrilla of the world, therefore he was asked to take the map with ten fingerprints from Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the body, it does not recognized by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant of the zone, without glasses and much more lean. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don&apos;t lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the dead body with those of the map. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> The eye has deceived it not: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that Yes, it was the Supreme Leader of Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> For footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín de Cali the recognition that the President Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people is not our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which may be crucial in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In part to identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirmed the identity of the captured people. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When are captured, many offenders have false identity cards or have no documents. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take fingerprints and look for in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researcher was told that in a case of theft he had to remove a section of wall of a House, because in this place the thief had supported his hand out a safe full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the mark of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights&quot;, he recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints may also exclude or confirm suspects in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Interlude of the investigation it has been determined that a parent may be suspect of the crime and indeed a footprint on the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Even if this no. not guarantee it is the murderer, this place on the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactyloscopiste of the ITC explained that is extracted &quot;the fingerprints of the objects with physical or chemical reagents&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, one uses a Picker or a band for them. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of the déclinquents, or the National Civil Registry. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers,&quot; indicated the expert of the ITC. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the television CSI program. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As all that glitters is not gold, everything you touch is not necessarily a footprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, it can be used, if it carries out the necessary confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;outraged&quot; defy the authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators jostled before the Zuccotti place to camp there. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A large part of the people accessing the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement occupied Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York trying to enter again, through a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Park of the great Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of protesters jostled before the place Zuccotti, where they access through a judicial order that allows the &apos;outraged&apos; camping again in this place, for the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more North of the city, where there were new cases. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the tribunal does not camping again in place, we will install us in another place and we will continue the fight to return to Zuccotti, and sit-ins through legal and peaceful protests&quot;, said - one of the spokespersons of the movement &quot;Occupied Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray has detailed that the answer &apos;outraged&apos; evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has arrived to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition, the &apos;outraged&apos; occupied a new park at the confluence of the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the tunnel Holland, New York and New Jersey, property of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Less than an hour they succeeded to occupy the place, but after the Police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even if Bray could not confirm the concrete figures, ensuring Efe that he saw few journalists that had also been handcuffed. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there is of centenarians of persons that were installed in this location, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene for them before the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> In the meantime, Zuccotti place - which is a forum of private property - is closed until the celebration of a judicial hearing by Tuesday during which must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> A few demonstrators moved until there were and distributed at this hour there copies of the judicial order and they engaged to officers who were watching the place, causing &apos;some small clashes&apos;, said Bray, who denounced the fact what some officials beat demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate occupied Wall Street members or enforcement of laws published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators to again access the park with tents or other properties that they used previously. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg has indicated to the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, which he however alerted the local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> Councillor defended personally conducted evacuation at dawn instead Zuccotti, an operation during which it has arrested 200 people and which was decided because of the fact that the demonstrators &apos;violated the Act&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became &quot;a place where people came to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do harm to others&quot;, because &quot;some stores had received threats&quot; and residents were afraid &quot;for their quality of life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repulsive and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers at the bottom&quot;, added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the Mayor of &quot;not respecting the freedom of expression&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> &quot;Occupied Wall Street&quot; officials also indicated that they do not think organizing &quot;major action&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of shelved, which began on 17 September. </seg>

<seg id="2407"> Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, convalescent still after the devastating earthquake which became nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the Japanese country since the second world war. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the Tokyo Government estimated material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be attenuated. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, the gross domestic product between July and September data were used to definitively turn the page: GDP has increased a 1.5% from the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> That registered the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the largest pace of increase since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> Recovery is partly, by the resumption of the acquisitions of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, the decline of 0.9% of the observed capital from January to March, the first decline after six months of rising non-interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is exclusively based on the Keynesian stimulus that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use gaps to grow from zero. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The Japan woke up mainly because of the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable has increased a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has returned to the internal market - the Japanese currency - yen became one of &quot;values,&quot; refuge elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger, the products are more expensive overseas, a major setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technology groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September the assessment of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not fall the guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We must follow the risk that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said the Secretary of State for political economic, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And indeed, the prospects are not all encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for cooperation and economic development (OECD) noted that the majority of countries members introduced in September of economic downturn clearer signals. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the points of inflection of the world economy has highlighted that the major powers are constrained. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Because it fell four decimal places up to 100.4 points, from 100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Eurozone was from below the mean, which is in the 100 level, n lowering eight decimal places up to 99,13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens again fueling doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign no written undertaking </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With triggered peripheral risk premia and uncertainty relocated to parks, Greece still entangled in the maze leading to the release of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Government of Greek transition is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels by a real conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative for reforms structural and that the period of one hundred days establishes in its designation will be short to apply, the leader of the conservative party new democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support the new measures of austerity in no case and reiterated its demand of new elections to the planned dates19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the Summit of October 26,&quot; Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, the reform of the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras No. has doubts on his position: &quot;We are committed to assist the Transitional Government, but we do are committed to nothing more&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader went one step further in his pulse as EU and IMF, organizations to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens requires urgently, and made it clear that he will approve any letter of commitment to implementation of the adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, still upset by the impact caused by the va-tout of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it débloquera help if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign not &quot;a commitment written without ambiguities as soon as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that inspectors of the Troika would return &quot;very soon&quot; in Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, even if there is a final date not more. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greeks still have much to do. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> The Queen Sofía: &quot;these are instruments for progress and hope&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen said the &quot;paramount&quot; place of the Spain with regard to this type of finance </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of the may&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the world regards this cooperation instrument whose &quot;essence&quot; lies in the fact that it is a &quot;tool for social progress, justice and hope in a future better for all of humanity, based on trust&quot; in humans. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen yesterday opened the V-e the World Summit of microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that such operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and &quot;very specially, in which a goal the reduction to half of the volume of people with incomes under a dollar a day&quot;to which the &quot;poverty threshold&quot; is set. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continues to work&quot; to enlarge the network of beneficiaries &quot;in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with&quot;responsibility&quot;, reported the Queen Sofía, which hoped that initiatives and dietary origins during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday,&quot;guarantee the creation of new capabilities and the best opportunities for the poor, particularly women&quot;&quot;the main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> We have &quot;reached many goals&quot; and &quot;we we face many challenges&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum of debate, but as the platform from which should promote &quot;two basic goals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, her Majesty has explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that millions of families out of the poverty line in which they now live. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The pulse in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;followed the trail initiated a few years as a pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, noted the Queen Sofía as an &quot;Act of justice and due recognition&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And she described the father of this instrument as an &quot;Idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, the work of which she knows since 15 years ago when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get its loan policy field. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as celebrated in Côte d&apos;Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;in every meeting I could see a continuing evolution&quot;, explained her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought it yesterday the qualifier of &quot;head of family&quot; meeting in Valladolid on the part of &quot;houses of the poor&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofía ended its intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Minister of external affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for any democratic State. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, it stated that it would be an error of vinculer cooperation with countries developing in times of economic prosperity, because it is a &quot;permanent duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that micro-credits imply &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the Governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and leave not be the victim of cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For the Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; give &quot;confidence&quot; to the people &quot;excluded which all close the door&quot;; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of the Riva, a welcomed those present in a city which &quot;opens its doors contaminated the solidarity spirit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect a European President by universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, proceeded without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor, and also President of the Christian Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally included in the program but has emerged in the fall, including to meet the activists who consider the Government&apos;s policy too lax against the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> 1001 Delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes that were given, the outcome of their interventions, Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile Minister of finance, was no place for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The Chancellor - and motion - idea-Mistress takes a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe, it is peace but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to a breakthrough in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This may result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage &quot;to give a face to Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Conference the inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy it is also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the milestone is made. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank by weight of each economy, which of course meant to reinforce the weight of the Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Anxious to allay the climate within his party, Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win its Conference on the back of the &quot;small&quot; countries or countries in trouble quick to criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel did not mention the France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except in hollow. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> Indeed, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon&apos;s army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> That represents the fraud to the disease cases? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the allowances, the UMP and Government launch the offensive on the disease cases. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a caisse d&apos;allocations familiales, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - the fight against social fraud and assistance. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> And to accompany this offensive, which share a desire to save money in a context of rigour, but is not less harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease cases. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First for the purpose of budget savings: the Government plans to impose on the employees of the private sector a fourth day of waiting before support of a stoppage of work. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without agreement of specific business, an employee falls ill lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure which might give rise to anger, but which would bring EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic scope: impose civil servants a day of non-compensation for stoppage of work waiting (they are so far not waiting, against three days period in private). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are under discussion, the majority also boosts the theme of fraud targeting this time abuse associated with work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The controls will be more significant and, in addition, if you are caught, you will repay&quot;, warned Xavier Bertrand to the micro of RTL, Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud in work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> It is in effect since 2002 ongoing monitoring and political offensives, which have often borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French not more ill than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Consider first the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the national insurance (CNAM) Fund, more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute for research and documentation in health economics, diem represented in 2008 5% of health expenditure with EUR 11.3 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> On this amount, 46% were leave maternity and accidents at work, and 54% concerned the disease cases, namely EUR 6.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And thus 2.5% of health expenditures. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have experienced an average 14.5 days of stoppage of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Group Alma Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average that hides differences some: another investigation, published in 2007 by career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed reported taking no day stop disease. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time of the insurance, said that in 2010, 37% of the disease cases were less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbours, the French are not more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall (for reasons of health or not) absence rates ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, 20% and 28% to the Denmark, 15% to 16% and 18% to the Netherlands United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The disease cases fraud represents very little to work to black. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> About fraud, it reached only a small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of legislation since 2002 is what controls are systematic on both disease in 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, about 1.5 million of controls, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term judgments were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, or 37 050 case. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of judgments over 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases &quot;inappropriate or unjustified&quot; on 1.2 million or 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> In total, therefore, 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases, on millions of employees having a disease case. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A figure that represents well little face, for example, to that of the black work. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros of profits tax per year, or more that the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more that fraud to the latter. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: the Greece must implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> The Greece will need a new adjustment programme to redress its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what said Monday 14 November Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, the Parliament, adding that 100 days given to the union Government would not accomplish this task. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To continue the efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment program&quot;, said the head of Government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of the euro area on October 27 will be the &quot;primary task&quot; of the new Government, because the participation of the countries in the zone euro &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> As a result, Mr. Papadémos provided that the public deficit will be reduced &quot;around 9 %&quot; of GDP by the end of the year, after was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right refuses new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, supported Monday to the measures already approved in an attempt to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party will not commit on additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We do not vote for new measures&quot;, he said at a meeting with members of his party, new democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> He was in agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and debt, and fight against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU pledges not the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantee of all parties that they would support measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would sign anything under external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a Committee of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report by the Royal Society of the Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> Palliative care, the Committee claimed that Governments, health care institutions, and physicians work together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The society lives in denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians indeed willing to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to this effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Canada society, which was attended by six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The Committee recommends that the Government to amend the Criminal Code to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is required, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Game entry, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> If the Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death to the Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Or medicalization, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the wish that most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually dying at the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, of the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is high, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrived at conclusions that run counter to the position of the Federal Government, which has already said want change to the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to experts, who also spent reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalization or decriminalize, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted on competent or non-consenting persons. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, argued yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, a co-signer of the report, are more found many cases of these spillovers in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is practiced in the Canada, where it is clearly illegal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Assisted suicide is practised at the Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians favour euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> It should be noted that 85% of Canadians already supported euthanasia because they believe that it would allow life people to ease their suffering, according to a poll Angus Reid made in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that the fact to legalize euthanasia will not effect to send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled is less in value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As to participating in assisted suicide, the surveyed believe 41% should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In matters of maintenance or termination of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also, the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal to legally valid is not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The Committee of experts also asked that health professionals are trained to the duty to respect a denial of end-of life care, without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> Palliative care, the Committee claimed that Governments, health care institutions, and physicians work together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests it to be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reserves of other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts in the field of the right to health have already expressed reservations concerning the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of the Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Mr. Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, described as &quot;extreme&quot; position of the signatories of the report experts, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the door to a situation where everything that would be tired of life and which have more than 18 years could ask that assistance to commit suicide&quot;, said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday with a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seemed to place the autonomy of the person above all other values involved in the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> However, &quot;in society, he said, there are tags and constraints&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the findings of the report, which she called a &quot;manifest pro-euthanasia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of the Canada, in particular challenges the data in the report the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave the power </seg>

<seg id="2560"> &quot;If Bashar had at heart the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; said the King of Jordan, neighbour of the Syria, in an interview with the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu said that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime are have a failure. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> &quot;Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot meet will leave&quot;, he said, making reference to the Syria, neighbouring country where the Turkey adopted a harder line. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> The United States are in turn praised a &quot;strengthening of the consensus against Assad&quot; and the actions of the regime Syrian, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> &quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries as the Turkey adopt a tone increasingly hard&quot; facing repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime perished in the Dera&apos;a area, in the South of the Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory of the rights of man (OSDH). </seg>

<seg id="2567"> At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem yet estimated that the country was &quot;heading towards the end of the crisis&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> He has also strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its work, as according to him &quot;a dangerous&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> The Syria &quot;does not decline,&quot; he added, assuring that &quot;plots contrived against the Syria fail&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> After its decision to suspend the Syria, the Arab League is now studying a &quot;mechanism of protection of civilians&quot; and wish the sending of 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country. </seg>

<seg id="2597"> The Institute for science and security International (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify this researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The IAEA expressed the week last of its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of Iran&apos;s nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> ISIS Drawing largely from documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamond by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a business producing &quot;nano-diamonds&quot; in Kiev. </seg>

<seg id="2603"> In its last report, the l&apos; AIEA IAEA evokes &quot;strong indications that the development by the Iran&quot; of a nuclear detonation system &quot;has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only familiar with this technique, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear program of its country of origin&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2605"> Crimes and offences against Muslims increased 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence have slightly decreased or made little progress, according to FBI statistics made public Monday. </seg>

<seg id="2607"> The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; very slightly increased to 6 628 cases, 47.3% motivated by differences of race and 20 per cent by differences of religion, according to the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again,&quot; said the Organization of the human rights Human rights First, &quot;the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant&quot;, said the organization in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, and all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights&quot;, one of the leaders of the Organization, Paul Legendre adds. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> &quot;The US Government can and should do more to address these abuses&quot;, he added, estimating that it could pass through an improvement of the reports of police on &quot;hate crimes&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2624"> The large social democratic/Christian Democrat coalition to power in Austria Government decided Tuesday to include in the constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget to reduce public deficits and avoid a possible degradation by the rating of the sovereign note by the Austria (triple A) agencies. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It is the social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann which has even announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely over the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as the Italy, the Greece or the Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the solvency of the Austria was lowered a single notch from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest more each year&quot;, argued the Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The Austria gives a request of the Summit in Brussels on the 26 October euro area Member countries: the heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration by end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or a statute of the same value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The device adopted by the Austrian Government is similar to the &quot;German model&quot;, the Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2633"> The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will intervene as we did the last time we find an excessive volatility&quot; in the yen exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Tuesday, the yen was not far from historical levels that pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo sold massively the yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just set a new record of force since 1945 to the greenback. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen rose regularly since then, doped by purchases of investors who consider it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in an uncertain global economic downturn and crisis of debt in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar is passed on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was trading at 160 yen around 120 yen and the euro more than. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> The outbreak of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it said the cost of products Made in Japan and reduced the value of revenues from abroad by the Japanese firms, when they convert currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;The Japan struggle to rebuild&quot; since the earthquake and the tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku (northeast) region, said Mr. Noda who feared that this inflation of the yen does kill in the fragile egg recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third world economic power has reconnected with the growth in the third quarter-1.5% from the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, with a rebound in exports and consumption of households lead by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister considered that the high cost of the yen did not reflect &quot;the economic fundamentals of the Japan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of finance, Jun Azumi, for his part called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two day meeting of its monetary policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts should prevail over dogma </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If it is a topic that cannot treat considerations of short-term or within l &quot;emotion, it is energy policy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and the cost of l &quot;electricity.&quot; influence directly on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is healthy that an electoral appointment is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and to the place that is nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be successful if it explores all of the economic, social and environmental consequences of proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base their opinions on objective facts, of the sound data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> While we are 7 billion d &quot;beings humans on the planet, l&quot; demographic changes will result in a doubling of the application &quot;electricity by 2050, less than deprive a huge part of the world&apos;s population of vital.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, he must compensate the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce l &quot;power permanently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate disruptions, a missing subject of ecological debate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2685"> Fukushima accident does not change any of these settings. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> This is why the Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is the case and the Belgium, who submitted his own to the need to find a source to substitute replacement, or Switzerland, which means just does more than build generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> At the opposite, Great Britain, the Finland, the Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the Sweden, South Africa, China, the India, the Brazil, to name only a few, continue their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their fleet with the construction of a central interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality has the speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will translate into inflation in the price of l &quot;electricity, energy dependency aggravated by the use of increased imported gas, in particular of Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, all of these negative effects are already being felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of the Denmark is to meditate. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> L European Champion &quot;wind, which he takes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the Intermittency of wind;&quot; under what, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the average European. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, with the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an invoice d &quot;superior electricity by 40% to French households.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2696"> In a global economy the cost of l &quot;energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from l&quot; the least expensive electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Thus, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a surge in the price of l &quot;power.&quot;, which would render illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power </seg>
<seg id="2698"> A price than a large majority of French refused to pay, so they are not principled opposition to this energy, polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Remember that the energy policy of our country has helped build an industrial chain of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 induced jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Highly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creative not harder to outsource overseas jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If the France decide to get out of nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs in reducing as shrinking the 6 billion euros per year of French exports d &quot;equipment and nuclear services.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What an electrician would require an EPR designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve l &quot;energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of production d&quot; power miracle, any more than there is of evil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Development by Areva of little card solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, reflects the complementarity of sources &quot;energy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2705"> For nuclear, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> We have France a safety authority who is uncompromising and transparent control on the existing stations on the Flamanville site. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited the same obsession with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; He remained without human or environmental consequence. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the drama. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the death of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it did for the two previous ones. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Result of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and manufacturers French and German, the EPR presents a design making it capable of resisting such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While he is regarded by all electricians who wish to build a plant, its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF leaving the way free for leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is essential and legitimate search for the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let l &quot;emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvering dominate debate also decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is immigration a load or a chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy immigration policy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to a policy of sales, compatibility of this policy with the status billing of &quot;country of human rights&quot; of the France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, the administrative harassment to which the subject is foreign students who made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read release of May 23) proclaiming the crossing that the France &quot;did not have foreign talents, Masons and restaurant servers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But it is only rarely analysed in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It is that on this subject a broad consensus between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that &quot;900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers&quot;, and on the left by Michel Rocard, explaining that the France &quot;can not accommodate all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as on the right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> For the two edges, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and the French company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the degree of generosity that one share grant to immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande is confined to banalities, indicating that the co-development will solve our &quot;immigration problem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a support, a problem, is perhaps pay electoral; but it is economically very costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As Ian Goldin economists remind and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Restrict immigration anemia growth and night employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may be a substitute for national workers, especially the few qualified, exercising pressure downward on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience has shown that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to domestic employees, exercising trades mainly in shortage of employment sectors. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training is not the offer of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty to work in a country experiencing a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration increases between 0.6 and 0.9% of real wages in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the American Nobel Prize;) Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The World Labour Organisation estimates for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of term, fetch missing growth points &quot;with teeth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, still suggest European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious asset; It is also a well fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember him, for the have invented in Athens there are more than two thousand years, has experienced throughout the 20th century tragedies of the great war, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Portugal, colonels in Greece Salazar. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some could believe that it would be sufficient, that democracy finally triomphât his enemies, to exercise the vote, to exercise it in the most direct manner that is. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Known, since Napoleon &quot;small&quot;, that this was a facility of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even be &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as once said the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control authorities, education, enlightenment, solidarity, economic and social justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe today is an economic crisis, but it is equally and first a crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The Palinode of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this regard double revealing value: the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also disturbing sense of the inability of its incongruity. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be thought to be exceeded. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front of the democratic battle lines are now displaced, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are more in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain by requiring a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and order dispersed. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank check to the European absolute monarch or a jumping feet into the vacuum of the nationalist fold: what choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we don&apos;t want of sunset but a common exercise of right, serene and continuous, the choice and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in the Portugal - cannot be indeed more where stop l &quot;enumeration - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is Europe that folds to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers impotence and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe which is humiliated on the international scene. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with each of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency, it is back to popular sovereignty the pilotage of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> As it is, that the Europeans can reduce the weight of their debt, free markets, and the future by investing. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The output of crisis will involve decisions at European level which can be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After having long fought this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now claims the European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Either. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But think without a political and democratic integration more strong, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We take a new step in the construction of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To the France Republic, it took &quot;make&quot; of Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution in the interests could not be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We need to build a more integrated economic Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be that by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people&apos;s sovereignty. </seg>

<seg id="2777"> Their share should still advance in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent 10% of the global market for the card smart (6,925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Long time trolling the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and accept payment terminal 75,000. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings are modest: 400,000 Visa Contactless cards have been deployed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But large areas are overdrive. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour and issued this year 2.5 million Pass MasterCard contactless cards. </seg>

<seg id="2786"> But this is only a first step to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Few devices are today equipped with essential NFC (Near Field Communication) technology for transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They took the delay&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But they should finally know booming next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We are building on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world&quot;, explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But banks take the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> Farm credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next at Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone of some 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a case authorizing the payment without contact. </seg>

<seg id="2799"> Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers in has now &quot;convinced&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is cooperation,&quot; he said without more precision. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris appears to be a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two French in Niger in January would have on the day of the gateways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time many of their captors in an operation launched by special forces French. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, were French investigators and Nigerians to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of past calls refers to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues particularly interested investigators: one leads to a Niger who stayed at length in Maiduguri, a city in the North of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other a man who said close to AQIM and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It is a step forward but it is probably expected more formal evidence to speak of operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;It has been known for years that the sect has support financial and external intellectuals and that it shows more and more active&quot; temper Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months these &quot;support&quot; were more obvious in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in its procedures, which involve now the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and same invoice that those used by AQIM. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> Therefore, the international community, beginning with Washington, put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of little interesting illuminated. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Early success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and Imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram — which means Hausa &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in Nigeria&apos;s Muslim north. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association was a rapid success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It is politicized and requires a strict Sharia compliance while its activists undertake the fight against infidels central Government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> They are first churches, bars, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the Boko Haram militants are particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuja is usual, without nuances. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army invests the city, there are 800 dead. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, stopped living, was killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Therefore the sect will become radicalized and leave his fiefs of the North. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Last Christmas, it claims an attack which is 80 people dead in Jos, and then another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram is HQ secure police in a suicide, his first attack. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be his first international target. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that sail of Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria concerned now all security experts. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While AQIM has invested the Mali and Niger, that the Somalis of al-Chebab operating in the Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent. </seg>

<seg id="2831"> On China, on the Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete simplicity and lack of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> A weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other multiply the thundering declarations, and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, on the Iran, Israel, slogans assistance - often not supported - flying. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the best position in the race for the appointment of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and to put in question &quot;for their currency manipulation&quot;, a carrier theme in America is exasperated by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Both worse if this must involve starting a commercial war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangle with an attitude that &quot;panders&quot; emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He has called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama current position). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, stagnate in the depths of the polls, is inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> The image of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised military on the Iran strikes if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I am elected, I will stop the Iran, he fanfaronné.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama is re-elected, they have the bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama fail in its obligations to this partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The contractor Herman Cain, second candidate best placed, displays for his embarrassing ignorance of records. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, he called to address the Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;trying to develop a nuclear capability&quot; - apparently unaware of the fact that China holds military Atom since 1964! </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strikes against the Iran, was prepared, meanwhile, to engage the US military to the Mexico against the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> It is the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current President replicate that Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine anti-terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist on the failure of his naive with the Iran dialogue, initially too precipitated the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq, on his zigzags in Libya, he correctly and pasting a small label. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new door nTry of Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe with the Russia from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> To provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brightness. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests including four heads of State and Government attended, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between Orchestra and end buffet, at the opening of Nord Stream, the new pipeline linking directly, under the sea, the Russia to the Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte together turned the wheel of the valve Commander Russian in the West European network gas entry. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will reach every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km linking the St. Petersburg region in the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube should be completed end of 2012, to issue a total 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And it already refers to the possibility to build a third on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the completion time and time of this huge site has tunes of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project had been strongly challenged by the Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Nord Stream will indeed deliver gas directly into Germany, avoiding a land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> At the time, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to influence the Russia by threatening to cut off access to West European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a &quot;new German-Soviet Pact&quot;, in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to fill the Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is, if the subject is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> The Western Europe, with its support for the Russian project, there won greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is the price of a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has created a wedge between Eastern and Western Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> The Russia successfully, in just five years, bring his vision of a direct alliance between the Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly consumer of gas, and the fields are in decline. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with the Russia, it is a new artery which links us organic way,&quot; confirmed François Fillon in inaugurating this pipeline, showing how the major gas contracts are also political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in numbers in Lubmin, point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The underwater tube is wrapped steel concrete to protect against the anchors of ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build, it took avoid minefields dating from the second world war. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It also took more measures to protect the fauna and flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing stops along its length: valve, or maintenance station. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A control platform was planned off the coast of the Sweden, but the project is abandoned while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian State company to establish a permanent off their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;Damage, we stop the passage of gas in under a minute,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Leaks, gas in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is considered unlikely by builders who expected welds for a leak every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The State of the pipeline are monitored by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external observation, and a device that circulates within the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, large of one metre in diameter, and it is being pushed by the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 metres second, it delivers accurate information about potential deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to function 50 years without any remedy. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The flow of gas is simply under pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> It is 200 bars in the first place, and 100 on arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to implement this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leader is Gazprom, retains 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Is are joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zug, in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then leased to the company for twenty years renewable, all of the transport capacity of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported&quot;, says Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the construction of the pipeline has provided 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the project is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment is up to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are sure to recoup their investment, since only Gazprom assumes the risk. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline emerged from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the output of the gas door. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the pressure, temperature, and the specificities of gas happening, until he is transferred to German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas to every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a book of mark. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to bring back the taste of writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has a perfume of adventure, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its rectangular cover black, his elastic, leaves of a white color broken, as aged by time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> However, the Moleskine notebook as it is known today was born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook design but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book is based on old technique of production, mole skin (Mole skin) which designates a varnish cotton used to cover seats for example. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of book was popular writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has surrendered to the taste of the day something old and forgotten, was an icon of avant-garde artists, to the 20th century&quot;, says Maria Sebregondi, now the Manager of the mark in Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased 26% to 12.7 million of past pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> It is the confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 notebooks were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports in 70 countries, from the France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Difficult to establish a profile of the buyer, because the notebook seduced both the student and the professional businessman. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open minded and cultivated. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early stages, has almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices; one in Milan and one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its books in libraries, the Fnac shops of downtown and was able to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We followed the time air and this new need for writing, despite the growth of e-mail&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched a &quot;Detour&quot; exhibition where architects or artists expose their own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it also launched coverage in Leopard, Locarno film festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine was able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The mark is available on a wide range of media. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success which made the envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital Investment Fund, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why is the unemployment rate of the disabled workers left so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Approximately 19% of disabled people are seeking work. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a proactive public policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared to 9% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, said Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress made since fifteen years are substantial.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;It remains nevertheless still lot to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, barriers remain many prior to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They are rather old: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have low levels of qualification: 80% do not have the tray and on the 2.3 million higher education students, 10,000 only are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for persons with disabilities, against 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, as many criteria that significantly complicate the return to employment, and which &quot;constitute the crux of the problem,&quot; according to Christian Grapin, Director General of springboard, an association created in 1992 to help the enterprises recruiting disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> This is the objective brake. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Is the unspoken, attitudes changing, of course, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by the association IMS-take to the city indicates that surveyed managers have &quot;a level of low knowledge of disability&quot;, with an &quot;over-representation of persons in wheelchair of the deficient mental or intellectual&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result, the more companies of 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employment for 6% of disabled workers, in an act of... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latest figures known, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now around 3 %&quot;, said Pierre white, Director-General of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies who do not respect this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The evidence: the number of &quot;taxed&quot; institutions, just as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 to 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created pressure on businesses, explains Pierre white.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflects true conscience decision-making, especially in large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82% of companies of 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;as of happiness&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before facing the Blues Tuesday evening (20 h 45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hid the pleasure that provides the friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It will not up to writing that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium to the stage of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard actually made peace. </seg>

<seg id="2974"> &quot;It is is crossed just now.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2989"> For him, there is not the shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, to the joysticks since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> The Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debunk. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In the light of the game go (0-0), in the hell of Zenica Friday, it appears obvious that the games are not made. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> The Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, certainly, but he was unable to score this valuable goal, which would have relieved him. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;This is a good result, which has however a risk because we have not marked goal outside&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home, in their light stage of la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced of pass, before an audience that should be there also boiling, even if part of course looks &quot;very tight&quot;, dixit a Bento optimistic but lucid. </seg>

<seg id="2999"> A draw may be enough to the Bosniacs, which also have need to mark. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;This is a good result, which has however a risk because we have not marked goal outside,&quot; said Bento. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We&apos;ll play against a team with a lot of technical qualifications and that has players with many individual qualities,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese have intent to input a maximum of pressure on the Bosnians to do &quot;step give them time to think.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea, provided that to be realistic, this time. </seg>
