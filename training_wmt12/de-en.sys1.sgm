<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic breakfast but only 23 per cent of the families of the students . </seg>
<seg id="93"> And - in most families bishop alone . </seg>
<seg id="94"> The worst was the assertion that in every tenth family is not any at all . </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the cornerstone of healthy daily diet . </seg>
<seg id="96"> The Umfragetest , among other things , on the day that they consumed in the families of overweight children much more often unhealthy chips . </seg>
<seg id="97"> And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink every day sweet drinks (70) </seg>
<seg id="98"> Although more than 40 per cent of children sport , but only less than half of their parents do this - just 15 percent . </seg>
<seg id="99"> Just give you your own menu together </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), from opportunities offered to put together their own menu appetito and opinion . </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot; What Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of diet bias; , is far away from the ideal of a healthy diet . </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite foods were many meal food , meat , and , of course , fresh food . </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot; What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet drinks , &quot; stresses in the final report on the survey . </seg>
<seg id="104"> At lunch , so the main course , pasta , just before poultry . </seg>
<seg id="105"> Pulses of almost all the children and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts; than lunch was very low . </seg>
<seg id="106"> Hinkehr on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time , the survey showed , however , that the children are quite prepared to change their eating habits , if they get the right information . </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot; At the controls of the survey , the questionnaire after the conclusion of the present speech &apos; obesity is no coincidence &quot; out , was in many cases a significant shift in the preferences to principles of healthy diet , &quot; is in the results of the project . </seg>
<seg id="109"> This was evident in the case of the sweet Limos , where many children began to give ordinary water . </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children point in the questionnaire also much more often chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less dumpling or over-sweetened food to eat . </seg>
<seg id="111"> Experts; claim - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the initial article , learn how Stylisten , I always had a little bit that this was a bit too much fuel for the beginning . </seg>
<seg id="113"> I was not in the slightest , which still is . </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures of three professionals in the industry , the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the &quot; in the square &quot; . </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is even worse to come . </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer we get to the test is , the more information and practical challenges; us before . </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even when there is of course any on Saturdays and Sundays , he is nevertheless fully . </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time , we debated with Director Alena (on course is not a single man), as a woman , which has no ideal proportionierte figure . </seg>
<seg id="119"> And most of us . </seg>
<seg id="120"> Have a short neck and the other to a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig . </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is a matter for the Stylisten , broad shoulders look to conceal , conjuring up the neck or the necessary graphs . </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got tips on how to Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - therefore , with great bosom , a hip and narrow their - nicely and attracts figurbetont , without fulfill--even too provocative . </seg>
<seg id="123"> If , for example , the difference between their and hips is so great that the rock or the trousers really does not suit , it should at least a piece of clothed; groups . </seg>
<seg id="124"> This will certainly be not regret , because good clothes is simply unaffordable . </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailor-made Rock you feel are much better than in a , the high and verrutscht , in the course of their absteht , etc . </seg>
<seg id="126"> Jungenhafte figures can afford , in turn , clothing with wrinkles , construction , applications , lace or to take Raffung . </seg>
<seg id="127"> For this amount of information and Figurtypen I am glad that I have a whole week time to let me go through the Oxfam-International everything thoroughly . </seg>
<seg id="128"> And yet , I fear , not to create it is given the task assigned House almost . </seg>
<seg id="129"> All the participants were given a Promi , for which they should devise appropriate attire - days clothing and Abendrobe . </seg>
<seg id="130"> We are the current appearance , the Modestil of the corresponding stars and its Figurtyp on board . </seg>
<seg id="131"> To Miranda Kerr &quot; , &quot; that you may be from the campaign &apos; know Victoria &apos;s Secret . </seg>
<seg id="132"> Within juble I , because it is much better for me personally , as , for example , Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera , the last time on the hundred kilos has increased (oh well , this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez . </seg>
<seg id="133"> The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet , state and then deal with graphically . </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the &apos; Moodboard &apos; , as the whole result is known , is our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design . </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is very important to consider the graphic side of the Stylings too . </seg>
<seg id="136"> The Stylist attracts the model not only physically , but is also known as the product side in the journalist (after concrete , for example , Trend-Handtaschen coats , etc .). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Full-status told us of the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník . </seg>
<seg id="138"> But the only on Sunday . </seg>
<seg id="139"> That means that must have a Stylist a good overview . </seg>
<seg id="140"> The figures with information on type-approval angefüllte Saturday speech was peppered from three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> The Stylisten Jan Pokorný , from fashion designers Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben . . </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this . </seg>
<seg id="143"> And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way . </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word means variability . </seg>
<seg id="145"> So you can take , for example , a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans , a T-shirt or coat , you can have it but also on the naked body , subparagraph shoes to attract and take it as a dress . </seg>
<seg id="146"> Enough is enough , or roll up our sleeves and get to see from the whole look very different . </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot; Others-plays , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most came to me but the following Council: &quot; First of all , you have to know the rules perfect . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot; Only then you must violate them , &quot; said Jakub . </seg>
<seg id="150"> It is clear to me why we need to pauken all these theories , which can be combined with what and why , even if you get to see in Modejournalen often quite different . </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention fashionable look . </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now , that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options , as photographed it . </seg>
<seg id="153"> So we need for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared , at least fifteen to stylen . </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the clothing on the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality . </seg>
<seg id="155"> With all of this , so in the design of the attire . </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and Styl sometimes make up half of the success , which confirmed a Jan Pokorný as well . </seg>
<seg id="157"> Because one needs only to Madonna , not just a brilliant singer , have made the image and marketing a world star . </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic is the services of a Stylisten rather reserved . </seg>
<seg id="159"> Also doet people often think that this is a wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something , how I turned out is secondary). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if any of us stylen , then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs . </seg>
<seg id="161"> It needs to be googlen then only to determine with certainty that writes the tabloid press , the Promi have declined to or , etc . </seg>
<seg id="162"> On Sunday , Jan and Mario Inter-ministerial us not to believe , that we are in Stylist just to focus on the fashion and then the clothes &quot; assemble them &quot; needs . </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work must communicate it , especially with the people who he stylt and he must be a clever psychologist . </seg>
<seg id="164"> People think , without curry favor and stick to its opinion . </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot; If any of us , a director in order to see their clothes cabinet and to complement fine , we can clear up and say we have the whole cabinet - my God , this is terrible . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot; You have to find at least a few worthy things , to which it recommends , what they can contribute , &quot; says Mario . </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us in real terms , as a so-called &quot; place pocket; &quot; must include . </seg>
<seg id="168"> So a pocket; , the pre-Maastricht in the waists zuknöpft and in the pre-Maastricht all the necessary Proprietäten in . </seg>
<seg id="169"> No such clear , as gap , Abroller to remove hair or security needles , they also Utensilien , such as a Nylonfaden (it helps the Stylist the photographing of products , such as handbags or avoid), specific clips , which will be tightened up , the clothes , if it is too big Stecknadeln (or other Klemmen are banned , so that is not the substance of) and , of course , Nähzeug . </seg>
<seg id="170"> So we must listen to but not only , but also to try something , we learned , as in we put shoes . </seg>
<seg id="171"> Is also in the photography at the courses , where the floor is , it is the Schuhsohle damage , let alone the outside . </seg>
<seg id="172"> We klebten o and klebten we ... </seg>
<seg id="173"> With the gap must be the shoes again , so that they are not damaged . </seg>
<seg id="174"> So we must be really well . </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario was me , by my &quot; creation &quot; praised without restrictions . </seg>
<seg id="176"> The skill is not just mentioned my strength . </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this was only a fraction of what we did in the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs . </seg>
<seg id="178"> One thing is clear to me now - to address the styling at a professional level is not an easy task . </seg>
<seg id="179"> V Need for steroids: &quot; The turgidity &quot; - the illegal race across America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Recession; </seg>
<seg id="181"> The original reckless journey is through a series of entirely preventable , dilettantish mistakes; routine in the morning . </seg>
<seg id="182"> It was , the ambitions; in large part to play , but what is the point , if there is clearly no one wish , a bit more to do . </seg>
<seg id="183"> Even before he came to the Ladentische , the new part of Brejão with subtitle , &quot; The turgidity &quot; high expectations . </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised , but the old games series &quot; Need for steroids &quot; to postpone a step into a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration in play seemed to be not only one of many Action-Rennspielen . </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages in which the main protagonist from the car , and continue on foot . </seg>
<seg id="186"> But how NFS is , is actually a case , so accustomed than was expected . </seg>
<seg id="187"> Sure - there are potentially very decent Arkade-Rennen , but on the whole , the game from a number of unnecessary errors , which are present in this series are already more or less a few years . </seg>
<seg id="188"> So there are no more mistakes , but signs of incomprehensible laziness in principle the games developers . </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well . </seg>
<seg id="190"> First introduced it in history , has its main character Jack certain problems personal nature , the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America . </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco , on the west coast , set to the wheel , with the task to be first in New York . </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements . </seg>
<seg id="193"> The whole route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty individual race . </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every race on other route and that the various stages in different , different and interesting enough milieu . </seg>
<seg id="195"> One gets the impression that game would not take a moment to offer the same thing over and over again . </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of these environments are still very nicely , though , not the technical level the graphics on the earlier part of the series . </seg>
<seg id="197"> So nothing called; . </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey through the desert , herbstliche landscape or high above--relatively visually inspected by verschneite landscape we very pleasant . </seg>
<seg id="199"> Now and then atypical elements a little change in the individual race . </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert , for example , is surprised by a desert storm , which reduces the point of view . </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains , in turn , must you need to watch that you will not by an avalanche of being buried . </seg>
<seg id="202"> By the way are quite good running the individual race . </seg>
<seg id="203"> Only a few , but they are . </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a while they tried to overtake so , the number of compulsory opponents (in principle) a classic race , then there will be time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expected an even a personal duel with a single opponent . </seg>
<seg id="205"> And that also involves himself the police , the whole thing will blow . </seg>
<seg id="206"> A novelty are passages in which Jack out of the car . </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is more about certain interactive , in which Jack before anyone is and where he has to help the players in the right moment , the right button . </seg>
<seg id="208"> So nothing complicated . </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising , however , that there is in the game much less such passages , as one would expect (actually only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> After all , this is to the advantage of rather , because this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above--relatively point one of the elements that make the game diversify . </seg>
<seg id="211"> The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts . </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that from today &apos;s point of view , it is no trees , on the other hand , you could not say that it would be bad . </seg>
<seg id="213"> Who realistic simulations , must look elsewhere . </seg>
<seg id="214"> But a action; invited Rennfahren meets the European Fahrmodell continue , although could be found in the competition better . </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then , as far as everything is well . </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems , only after a certain time . </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the Fahrmodell is not the conflict-of-law model quite OK </seg>
<seg id="218"> Of a game of this kind is difficult to expect that it complicated deformations and collisions , but if it has virtually no impact on any object idea , what the car is doing , then obviously not everything is in order . </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typical example: the close do or over--and drive to oncoming cars &quot; does &quot; in some of the other car only slightly , in others , almost identical situation is but skidding and is wild performance . </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or the Karre to scrap . </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the Restart-Systems makes it no more , it is annoying . </seg>
<seg id="222"> The rest are resolved as Arts: if you total damage has or is far outside the line , then a the game on the last point . </seg>
<seg id="223"> Only - in every race has only five rest Arts . </seg>
<seg id="224"> If they have exhausted , all from scratch . </seg>
<seg id="225"> The rest are Arts , rather as a tool in the event that is not something that should leave but not on it . </seg>
<seg id="226"> Helps sometimes but not even the Restart , and nothing else , as the critical section to learn from the head . </seg>
<seg id="227"> Extremely unpleasant , is that the same things happen often in the same places . </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some curves must pass through , for example in a specific way , otherwise it is not easy . </seg>

<seg id="276"> Ambassador Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot; The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions feelable upset . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> I did not expect that such a hard war flares . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot; It will take five , six years , until the dust settled , and all will have become accustomed to her new role , &quot; began girl Milena Vicenová , the Czech ambassador to the European Union , rather launch-on-warning lecture at the law faculty . </seg>
<seg id="281"> How seriously it takes the motto &apos; Verständlich and openly about Europe &apos; , they showed in the first part of their lecture , in which it was , the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that they so many editor would have the law faculty of the Karlsuniversität can . </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot; There has been criticism that he had to quietly - a grey official who is not up to such a role , but I must say that it has &quot; all the time , how well he has taken up the cause . </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot; He is a person who it is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patient; to communicate with them and the particularly clear ideas on how to proceed with the EU . </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the answer to the question: Who is the is supposed to - the European Union ? What number I call ? &quot; , so as an important step towards the integration and better visibility of the EU &apos;s policy towards states , such as China or India . </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants us our Ölmützer Quargel ban </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs Vicenová , also of the agenda , in accordance with the European Union , and lived in the near future to live . </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency of two years ago , describing it as a success . </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership . </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government during the Presidencies described it as a great negative , which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic . </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full . </seg>
<seg id="292"> Said with the words of the ambassador , was not only the Presidency , but also in the subsequent crisis , which is not yet to quite hectic . </seg>
<seg id="293"> And there must be approved by the Sieben-Jahres-Budget of the EU , which makes it precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated . </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget , which received industries , which countries more and receive less support - all of this is now on the agenda . </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels , &quot; Verständlich on Europe . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot; If I do not like something , then it is gräuliche SWIFTs , vocabulary; and jargon that nobody understands . </seg>
<seg id="297"> How can I as citizens; really know whether it is in Brussels really curly or round cucumbers and different great bananas invented or whether anyone actually want to ban the Quargel . </seg>
<seg id="298"> They used the soil of the EU would also like to , in order to get more Czechs in European institutions . </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe of two or different speeds in prospect </seg>
<seg id="300"> The EU believes that the Czechs have a reputation for , to be Eurosceptics , the more the negative , as the positive sides of the issue . </seg>
<seg id="301"> All the more worrying is the low representation of Czechs in European institutions . </seg>
<seg id="302"> There are many factors , including the moderation; our candidate , whose inability to write letters and motivation not least the weak support of the Czech side . </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the successful Czech Presidency it lifted the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group , of the V4 . </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot; Believe me , if a Pole or Hungarian come to me and is a Slovak , in the vicinity , then the Frenchman next to me: &quot; Hey , what is it is because the heads together - is once again your V4 ? &quot; And it makes a quite acid Face . </seg>
<seg id="305"> Mrs Vicenové , expect the EU especially tough rules in the future of far-from-equilibrium budgetary policies more of the member states . </seg>
<seg id="306"> As much of that as a &quot; European Federation &quot; is the concept of a Europe of the two , or even different speeds . </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot; We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone . </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot; We already have the Schengen area and we have the Institute of Harbor cooperation . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot; For the first time , it was said that should work only the countries that want it and those who do not want it to be quiet outside . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot; There will be more and more of these institutions , which ultimately on a strong &quot; multi-speed Europe &apos; , &quot; Mrs Vicenová expected . </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect , paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle , according to the need to be considered not all issues with impact on the whole of the EU by all the member states and only by the countries of the euro zone . </seg>
<seg id="312"> Fire story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovator IBM enters its existence the second century </seg>
<seg id="314"> Wanted to look for a suitable word that characterised the strategy of IBM most closely , that would be the word &apos; longevity . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> IBM is a synonym for technological revolution to the general public , it is known as a modern companies , although since its inception a century has passed . </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this longevity , already presented its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson H.W. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he argued the slogan , countless were easily solve global problems , if the people were prepared to think a little bit . </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot; think ! &quot; Has been so for the trademark , for the life of the future giants should (and at the same time to the title of the internal magazine , which , in IBM in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture . </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot; For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future . </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was also an entire century , because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else surrounding it . </seg>
<seg id="322"> The allowed us , in the course of our first century , the technologies to transform the business and society . </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years , &quot; said Samuel J. Palmisano , who is now director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary . </seg>
<seg id="324"> Thought-out system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson was already in the thirties socio-medical its employees - in a similar way , such as the Baa entrepreneurs in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute had as one of the first American workers paid leave , insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a reasonable pay system for best innovators and traders . </seg>
<seg id="326"> As more sophisticated are also of IBM long-term relationships with their customers . </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was from the outset in the brilliant talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world , on IBM any discrimination - and could decide accordingly . </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan , will barely-existent the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty . </seg>
<seg id="329"> Is already the thirty years with IBM , so far , the position of the Vetriebs- , marketing and strategy leader; . </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM makes so-called Online-Brainstormings in recent years , from where many future strategies and innovation . </seg>
<seg id="331"> No wonder - ideas there are enough , the company is almost half a million people . </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Their unwavering position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and this after within and outside . </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot; From the outset , IBM , the concept of an institution , as a mere technology-producing company , &quot; said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter . </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot; IBM is not a technology-producing companies , but a company , the business helps solve problems using technology , &quot; added George Colony of Consulting-Firma Forrester Research . </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the companies themselves , there is a difference , to be on the market only present or to shape it through this presence directly . </seg>
<seg id="337"> Family called &quot; Big Blue &quot; for their logos IBM - in the States , is one of the largest companies in the world has come in a century . </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software , infrastructure , hosting and consulting services in a broad product - of servers to nanotechnology . </seg>
<seg id="339"> Of all the American technology companies has IBM most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize . </seg>
<seg id="340"> To its most famous inventions include , for example , bank machines , credit cards , Finanzswap , bar code or the diskette . </seg>
<seg id="341"> With approximately $ 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was IBM in this year &apos;s second largest technology-producing companies (after Apple), and it took for the first time since 1996 , Microsoft . </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations , the taste of the customers of today - were unhappy OS for example the attempt with its own operating system / 2 , the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr . </seg>
<seg id="344"> &apos; business is based on the forward movement , not tie it emotionell in the past , &quot; said to Samuel J. Palmisano . </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore has no problem IBM , its foundations to build on various platforms - and if they do not work , they have to leave . </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to the opponent Microsoft , with its Windows operating system stands and falls . </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> To the factor- of IBM participate in great extent services , software and hardware to participate in a fifth . </seg>
<seg id="349"> It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share . </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit safest assets with a value of $ 15 billion , in the same time , however , $ 58 billion in the future technologies . </seg>
<seg id="351"> In these investment continues IBM after 2008 , and saw the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world . </seg>
<seg id="352"> Here , too , IBM was faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson , in the midst of the Great Depression its scale . </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far , it seems that survives the company IBM today &apos;s crisis unscathed . </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the IBM-Aktien rose by 120 percent since 2008 raketenartig and the profit of the company productivity--the kontinuell . </seg>
<seg id="355"> Is the corporate slogan of IBM: everything can change - not only the values . </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis resolves . </seg>
<seg id="357"> Ibm-geschichte: from cheese Schneider to space flights </seg>

<seg id="454"> One second to reached the final of the first third of the Heimspieler Patrick Dwyer a Short-Hander , but the second third again the Flyers . </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux . </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hits , then Wayne Simmonds whose shot for the fourth goal . </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot; I love to play with him . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot; I am not saying that he is the best players in the league , but certainly it is one of the best three &apos; , paid tribute Jágr his Center . </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot; It would be in life not occur to me that I would like to end my career with such a player is , as with him . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="461"> &quot; I am raising my game on I too . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot; All the years in the NHL my fellow-player questioned their game on me a and now turns the tables , &quot; schmunzelte Jágr . </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina game even more to the tragedy - by the right of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer , who is from a Strafschuss victory , it was on a goal . </seg>
<seg id="464"> Little Read , but any further complication , in which he was successful in majority two against one . </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot; Excellent , Pronger in our zone . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot; He got off the Puck , I took on and (Read), to more distant framework . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot; I tried to take it and I am glad that it has worked , &quot; Voráek described the last hit of the game from his point of view . </seg>

<seg id="470"> The Candiens losing about their learnt Beck also a unverloren their leadership in Penalty-Schießen 2:3 . </seg>
<seg id="471"> One of the Strafschüsse could not Tomáš Plekanec . </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team , the high disease; absenteeism in the defensive; - the game they played only with five defensive players . </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot; This is bad . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot; The meeting; we played only to end with a single experienced players , the rest were young players . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot; But it can be to do nothing , so we must be ready , &quot; Jacques Martin said . </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot; For every change a wave after wave and we had nothing . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot; We had the game easier and need to bring the Puck from our third . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> There was room for improvement , &quot; said P. K. Subban , one of the defensive players . </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech gate-keepers; Ondřej Pavelec , thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg . </seg>
<seg id="480"> At the gates of the jets , which ended a series of five defeats , had five different shooter had share . </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of the travel prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there was in the SSR only five approved state travel agents: edok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist . </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agents sold at the time , especially only travel in the socialist bloc , in the West were the only chosen . </seg>
<seg id="484"> And so , Czech tourists in the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union in the Crimea peninsula (Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use it . </seg>
<seg id="485"> Was a silver excep the period from 1962 to 1972 , when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia , then a pro-Western course a proposed Yugoslavia and have therefore been severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia . </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of socialist times it was the fact that it may not even be citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel within the framework of the socialist countries . </seg>
<seg id="487"> If I wanted to travel a citizen of the SSR for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union , then took it to a so-called invitation letter , were not Individualreisen possible . </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even then , to the travel agents also travel to the West , then had to be huge queues in purchasing or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency , or at least &quot; good friends &quot; in the travel agency . </seg>
<seg id="489"> Also so the matter was not yet . </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called currency - the condition for an exit to the West - was only &quot; politically reliable &quot; of people - the other could not travel . </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czech currency was not free exchange as currency , foreign exchange , it would have been impossible , so the necessary funding (Western) find currency for a trip to the West . </seg>
<seg id="492"> The way most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home , it is no wonder that bought the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas - a habit that continues to this day . </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the revolution of the Czechs . </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR in Bulgaria or the measure of all things , spent the Czechs last year 4,5 million their holidays abroad in countries around the world . </seg>
<seg id="495"> A huge paradox , which is not at all now , is the fact that , in the most popular holiday country the Czechs - could not travel to Croatia 1989 at all , because it was part of the former Yugoslavia . </seg>
<seg id="496"> From the beginning of the 90 s of the last century was lifted in the foreign exchange duty in the neighboring West European countries , which caused a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany . </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Tschechoslowaken could not get over a long period of their trips to the West simply enough , everyone wanted to have at least a few days since . </seg>
<seg id="498"> So slept the Czech holidaymakers in travel to Paris in the tent in the park , because who would have guessed the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension . </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a with canned , beer and sausages , etc . Vollgepackter boot . </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades , our tourists buy the Western currency finally free . </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and , consequently , the average salaries rose to 1997 , which einmündete in another important moment . </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights , which the air travel because of the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts , economy--with compared to the past . </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 90 s , the Czechs , with the exception of the United States , already exchange of payment with all advanced countries in the world , making it even easier travel . </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of the &quot; post-utopian Velvet &apos; travel there was in 2000 , when it was Community-cleared thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand . </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since then fly direct Charter-Flugzeuge with Czech passengers every year in distant sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic  exotic destinations . </seg>
<seg id="506"> Of the 100 Tsd . Czechs travel every year in exotic places ! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in the era , which our &apos; post-revolutionary &apos; development marked , came in 2008 . </seg>
<seg id="508"> Roll on 17 November 2008 , the US visas for Czech tourists , which most definitely our country under the most developed countries of the world . </seg>
<seg id="509"> More than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in years the Czechs spent 2008 (50,3%) and for the first time in its history peasants-a it for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt including the costs on the destination for more than 15 Tsd . CZK per capita . </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again , there is a stalemate . </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months , the Czech football and there is no chairman that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known . </seg>
<seg id="512"> Until today , there is still no agreement , after the electoral law . </seg>
<seg id="513"> And this is no vote on the three potential successor . </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík . </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June Hašek resigned his role , and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to come together and to find a strong personality , which could lead the football in the future . </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only in the era of Hašek , from the old squabbles between the two chambers Association , which are unable to agree on a joint candidate . </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was very clearly on 16 September , should be chosen as the new chairman . </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the main assembly; euro-egoism free of charge to Public House in Prague Smíchov quarter , because the negotiations led to a result and it was not only about the election itself . </seg>
<seg id="519"> We could not agree is about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutes representatives or even with the full power of officials . </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point it was at least partly agreement , which also helped the recommendation of the Institute for government and legal , whose opinion is not a representation at full power base . </seg>
<seg id="521"> The divergencies in order the electoral law , however , continue to take . </seg>
<seg id="522"> The Executive Committee did not bring more clarity in the matter , part-sessions , whether regular or extraordinary - is in principle nothing else on the agenda . </seg>
<seg id="523"> Even if the opinions in a couple of times about the election changed - the worst point remained the same . </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how do we proceed in the 3 th round , in order to avoid a stalemate ? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot; The issue is the question whether or not to be in accordance with the constitution , or whether we need to find a different model , &quot; said Duan Svoboda , one of the three deputy chairman of the ex-FAR , who represents in the management of the professional football . </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to a registered model candidate who prevails in the third round of the greater as support in the chamber , for which he stood . </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is supposedly ready to compromise , that the one candidate prevails , which the higher number of votes from both chambers . </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side again , on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count receives at least a two-thirds majority . </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot; We have the two Vorrunden make no sense , this method would put the entire two Chamber; concept in question , &quot; Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side , it would be the best , not tweaking the electoral law , but to choose under current rules . </seg>
<seg id="530"> Agrees with surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík , even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta . </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot; It is my wish that , as far as possible after the statute is elected . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot; It could be a nonsensical replacement options , such as at the last general meeting , &quot; said the owner of the (football clubs) Victoria Plzeň , the candidates for the first time and abgrenzte in his opinions in particular Pelta . </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta but remains optimistic . </seg>
<seg id="534"> His opinion , in Nymburk the new chairman will be known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future . </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot; The possible qualifications of the national team for the Championships today would certainly contribute to calm the emotions . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot; If the football until the euphoric wave ride them , then it is also the willingness to cooperate , &quot; the official says Jablonec larger , by all three Adepten the most experience and this is both at a professional , and regional level . </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is restrained . </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot; I hope for an agreement , but the situation is unfortunately is ambivalent . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot; This is not a matter between the people in Bohemia and Moravia , but there are some efforts , the rules to own purposes &quot; officialdom . &quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot; That is why a new on the general meeting not excluded . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot; However , I hope that common sense prevails in the end , &quot; said Rajchl . </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - there is not much time to the agreement of all sides left . </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should be supposedly directly in Montenegro , but who knows , maybe the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification will be completely at all . </seg>
<seg id="544"> The charter plane , with the should fly , among other things Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl after Podgorice , was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical problem , and so was urgently for a replacement variant , how to be a part of the executive committee but to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels . </seg>
<seg id="545"> In the end it is surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level , to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday . </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobe , the minister for education , youth and physical education have divided the parties within the biggest sports &apos; of the country to an agreement . </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot at stake: government grants , the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the ČSTV , the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction . </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík in the fight for the position of Chairman , because he sees no suitable candidates </seg>
<seg id="549"> If Tomáš Paclík , the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate to represent , all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR) have been met , he would have been not to the fight for the top position . </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot; If there was a good candidate , then I would fight for it and give up on the election . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot; But in the current situation , we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find , &quot; said Paclík ČTK . </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for Paclík , into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go , it is to prevent the pseudo-developmental favorite of the election , Pelta , at the top of the FAČR . </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stresses that he only if he wins the role of the chairman intends to exercise a year , until 2013 , until the date of the proper general meeting . </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of the chairman would have liked it to be a &quot; golden parachutes , &quot; the Russia--at is not too much in the football . </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot; With some in question people I have spoken personally . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot; Hard to believe that I have some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football . </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot; Such views would have liked to have changed , &quot; he quoted . </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most of all is Paclík supposedly the link Pelta &apos;s with the chairman of the Pilsner district Football Association Berbr novel , a man with kontroversem reputation , which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist , with the ability to influence delegated votes in general meetings . </seg>
<seg id="559"> It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable , that Pelta holds the position of the chairman . </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot; In his victory would become of einkonserviert and in the Czech football is not it at all . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot; The support of Berbr , a cleverem Businessman , would get the football pollero twice , &quot; said Paclík . </seg>
<seg id="562"> It is he , too , that Pelta &apos; was &apos;s name some time ago in connection with the investigation of corruption in a case , from the Pelta but go unpunished . </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot; I do not know what Prestige; a victory of Pelta (tsch .) football should get involved . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot; And where would we be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA , &quot; said ekl Paclík , its former said , &quot; it will sell the Pilsner football club , when will Pelta chairman &apos; , but something more . </seg>
<seg id="565"> Should win Paclík in Thursday &apos;s election , he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta . </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just as another candidate thinks - Rajchl , had supported the Paclík before the general meeting in October , which ended with a fiasco . </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot; He (Pelta) would be the first , to which I would go . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot; He has great skills . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot; I could imagine him well for example as head of the national team . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot; But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot; It is not my nose but in matters , which I understand nothing , &quot; said Paclík , who had been in September for attention that he was behind the recall of referee Commission with Luk Macela at the top , replacing the Dagmar Damková . </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík claims , it is equal to the role of the group leader . </seg>
<seg id="573"> And holding up his skills in the direction of private companies , since last summer , he is also head of Pilsen , the celebrated with his support in May the first triumph in the League . </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot; I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to the cultivation of this . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot; In order to limit the influence of interest groups , tend to the disciplinary and influence of commissions , which in turn to II; situations , &quot; led to Paclík , which makes no secret of its antipathy for example to the Sparta-Chef Daniel Ketínský . </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of its priorities would be the establishment of the relations between the ex-FAR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee , with which he would save in the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport . </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot; This is one of the key things that should devote itself to the new chairman . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot; When it comes to taxation of gambling , and declare the political parties , then I understand their reasoning , we have to say it but also very clearly where the money goes , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="579"> Its connection to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap , although he emphasised , the chairman of the ex-FAR &quot; bipartisan &quot; . </seg>
<seg id="580"> , in turn , is associated with Jablonec pelta Rajchl with the Prague Dukla . </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot; It is not ideal . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot; It is not my opinion but also make much sense to transfer my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years , &quot; said Paclík clear . </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of the ex-FAR , the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future . </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association , one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt , Miroslav Pelta promised he would if elected , that the FAČR new statutes that disputes over the electoral law , rule out in future . </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec believes is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and that the campaign would modest.They in any success of the Czech selection . </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September , he wants to focus on his election to the national team and the collection of funds . </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided only at the last moment , to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so was the two-month break help him to defend his ideas about the running of football and in a broader context . </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot; People at all levels to address the football , they are impatient and therefore expect that know the chairman on Thursday . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot; He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone , the man who believes in particular is linked with the Jablonecer club , but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee . </seg>
<seg id="590"> Also , he has said that it had sufficient experience , in order to lead the Czech football . </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that is for today &apos;s problems with the election of the euphoria that was at the time of Ivan Hašek . </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot; Unfortunately have been approved by the General Assembly in June statutes , which were not completely , as it had adopted all . </seg>
<seg id="593"> If they had not allowed different interpretations , from September , &quot; said Pelta had a chairman . </seg>
<seg id="594"> Just the revision of the most important document of the residents &apos; association he used as a sweetener for the delegates . </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot; Should I be chairman , then I take it personally and I am prepared to take personal responsibility , if it does not work . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot; It is a matter of principle , without which he could not be , &quot; said Pelta . </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition , he is not trying to differentiate themselves from his opponent . </seg>
<seg id="598"> He had announced earlier , it could be a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , recognizes the for its legal education , and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy . </seg>
<seg id="599"> Also Tomáš Paclík , he has been for a long time , which , in turn , no dry thread Pelta the1990 . </seg>
<seg id="600"> In football it can more than a year ago and is already moving with some success . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot; But its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were very shocked by his election campaign . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot; Also addressed now many doubt his true nature , &quot; Pelta remain faithful to his opponent , probably the Caribbean-basin repeating proclamations , which he said in September . </seg>
<seg id="603"> His opinion , its biggest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions , to the national team . </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the flagship Czech football . </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot; I would try to end all Affairen - from the issue Bohemians , to the halls of the corruption scandal last year . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot; Then , would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football , &quot; said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate TK two months ago . </seg>
<seg id="607"> At that time , he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football no human cleansing; would mean . </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot; I had to make myself with the content of all employees familiar , &quot; he said in Strahov , where there is because of the long anarchy; understandably nervous . </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios , which accompany the forthcoming general meeting , he believes that the delegates on Thursday will not go to Nymburk in vain . </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot; If there really should be the only point of contention , as you choose in the third round , then we will be over . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot; The football needs credibility and win back only when he finally has a new Leader &apos; , Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day its official career optimistic . </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that to work the ex-FAR below him hard begins </seg>
<seg id="613"> If should be elected the ViceChairman Jindich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic , would supposedly feeding frenzy that many people in the group the whim . </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that , if elected , to work hard . </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual Fußballbereiche . </seg>
<seg id="616"> Also promised to resolve the case Bohemians , relations with the UEFA and FIFA to put more money into the football and will continue the work that has begun the previous presiding Ivan Hašek . </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot; As chairman , I would like to dwell on the football as a whole . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , on the national selection , the professional football , to the performance of football for the youth . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot; This is not to say that I want to do everything alone , &quot; said Rajchl in talks for ČTK . </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot; I am a team player and would like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that is devoted to each member a certain area . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will distribute hard tasks , so that the football in every segment with twelve-mile steps . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> Mafias; many would not just delighted , because they , rather than the work of other to criticise , now even to work really hard , &quot; he added . </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered not to stand at all . </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot; I know that I am working 20 hours a day . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot; But I must know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me , not me constantly stick; between the legs and every step that I make , calling into question , &quot; he said as an explanation as to why he has hesitated . </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot; However , many people have told me that I should not give up , because it would otherwise also others do . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot; It is confidence , we must not squander it , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="628"> Supposedly motivated him to be able to continue the work , which he has begun between Hašek . </seg>
<seg id="629"> I now &quot; in two years , we have dealt with a great deal of work and this is not simply throw . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot; It has been launched processes , the only in a few years to come and I would hate to see that it is painful , &quot; he said , and that his concerns that , in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Mr Pelta , could return to the situation in the days before Hašek . </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot; I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not brings . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &apos; behind him , especially people who would make the football so that it would be only for chosen as &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="633"> I think I can , but not a lot that I would be biased . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot; I try to be objective . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot; I want football for all , because it all goes well and not only of the candidates , &quot; said Rajchl . </seg>
<seg id="636"> It also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs . </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot; Even if some people say the opposite , I really don &apos;t have to do what is best for Moravia . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot; For example , it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part , whose winners in each of the first League felt . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot; Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league , particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem , &quot; Rajchl says . </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman , dares Rajchl not to estimate the chances that he will be elected . </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot; I have a strong support in the Czech Chamber , which has been elected to her deputy chairman and now realises that clear successes are behind me , &quot; led to Rajchl , which includes the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfortunate contracts , the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success . </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand , it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association is not a single thing . </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he Pelta says , &apos; he was disqualified from the outset , to bring greater confidence to the Czech football &apos; , he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate , of the football really have something to offer . </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot; No one can call into question , that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot; He should be elected , then he would continue the things that has taken Hašek Ivan and also the personnel in the commissions would not change it , obviously . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> It would make things certainly not altered just want , &quot; ruling in its favour Rajchl on his rivals . </seg>

<seg id="685"> Agri-foodstuffs speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> German bank is raw materials business , </seg>
<seg id="687"> By Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> , the German bank their business with agricultural commodities on ? </seg>
<seg id="689"> SPIEGEL-ONLINE-Informationen Josef Ackermann has a working group , the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world to examine . </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January the company wants to be consequences . </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> To the Federal citizens; it is clear:84 per cent of Germans do not find it according to a study acceptable; speculate that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize . </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents demanding that Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions from this business , because it is the problems of the world &apos;s poorest . </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa-Umfrage on behalf of the consumer organization foodwatch . </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report , the foodwatch in mid-October . </seg>
<seg id="696"> It shows the author Harald Schumann , that the bets in global commodity markets the prices - and the banks is complicit in the global hunger problem . </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the consumer is specifically against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann , even if banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly . </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally intended natural-resource-related betting , protect against traders price fluctuations . </seg>
<seg id="699"> But now , most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits . </seg>
<seg id="700"> Unlike the US-Konkurrenten Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is &quot; worth it , the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank to gamble . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE International is a working group at the accusations from the Foodwatch-Report . </seg>
<seg id="702"> By the end of the year should be completed the examination , then be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank , with a recommendation , how to deal with it . </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January will tell the top of the bank , then the consequences of it . </seg>
<seg id="704"> In the end could be a reduction of the commodity business , or even the complete departure . </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann turn to his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch-chef Thilo Bode welcomed the news , but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: &quot; The betting on rising prices of food shows a particularly vivid , ruthlessly banks today as the common good . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann , the chief lobbyist banks , particularly in the duty . </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot; The Deutsche Bank must remove all term-assets from its portfolio , in which money is used for betting on food prices , &quot; said Bode . </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot; Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank goes . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The clear-mindedness of Mr Ackermann at first glance surprising , but it is clear that the president of the company himself a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture . </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board . </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a move away from the controversial agri-foodstuffs speculation he could clean up its image . </seg>
<seg id="713"> And care for possible reductions it hardly needs to do - that would have finally , his successor . </seg>
<seg id="714"> Every second Annexes raw materials would announce </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high . </seg>
<seg id="716"> To date , more than 30.000 internauts have already taken part in the campaign of the organisation . </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday , Bode the survey , for which the institute Forsa on 7 th and 8 th November 1001 people has asked . </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just eleven percent think it is legitimate for that offers the Deutsche Bank Annexes involving bets on prices for food . </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would also consider personal consequences , if they know that their bank is involved in such high-profit-margin: every second would announce the poll , all installations , which flows of money into the commodity speculation . </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 per cent would advise friends of such a bank , 49 to reflect , to terminate their account and to move to another institution . </seg>

<seg id="722"> The umgezogene pavilion </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Mrs Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> An architecture history with ups and downs , End happy: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels , 1958 , was in Vienna to the museum , and unladen &apos;s . </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now he is in the exhibition . </seg>
<seg id="726"> If of modern architecture Greater , of clear forms , glass , the halls , courageous swings and new building materials are typical of the belief in the technical progress , it is the Austrian pavilion of the architects Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels Expo 1958 a good and famous example . </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy and completely Stahl-Glas-Konstruktion . </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction has , to date as a milestone contemporary architecture . </seg>
<seg id="729"> He made the architects so well known that the Austrian also in the next World Expo pavilion , . </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich , he was 1973 , internationally famous . </seg>
<seg id="731"> His as a temporary construction planned exhibition pavilion had been drawn up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden in Vienna southern railway station , converted and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20 st century - the &apos; 20 s , &quot; it was called . </seg>
<seg id="732"> Was defective and technically the buildings but neither space as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art , not a good climate . </seg>
<seg id="733"> It was , however , used until such time as the contemporary art in Vienna a new house . </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 , the building was empty and more and more . </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now has transformed the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion , he is now &quot; 21 &apos;s House &quot; and will be used in future as a museum for contemporary art . </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening opened the museum celebration , which includes the House , where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect . </seg>
<seg id="737"> Has managed the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco , which was 2007 new member of the Austrian gallery celebration . </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-arco , qualified art historian with considerable career , in the youth and Eiskunstläufererin , later at Sotheby &apos;s , the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg , the conversion to politicians and Denkmalschützern , they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and set the use . </seg>
<seg id="739"> The present art should be issued the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation , a café and a book shop there should be , and an office building had to be built . </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision , small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the operation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation . </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and South-Mediterranean and had won the competition , but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was &quot; incredibly important place &apos; , in which he &quot; almost every weekend &quot; had read the exhibitions . </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the Ur-Entwurf , and he knew the problems of the building , which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and ease . </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current restructuring there was far greater problems: the buildings was &quot; a Energieschleuder , &quot; Krischanitz says . </seg>
<seg id="745"> The page-window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and replaced the glass roof by special security glass . </seg>
<seg id="746"> Kältebrücken-stahlträger have been strengthened or replaced , and asbestos full blankets were rescued . </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two missiles were under way for the new use , a abgesenkter light gap between House and road; provides for the Belichtung , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building , but still the easy Schwanzer-Pavillon . </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original external doors have remained , the House is deleted in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz-Farbton . </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the theatre is exactly the way is even more , as he was in the past . </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this under strict supervision of the monument and with a small budget . </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot; Often had to be found a material that is good and proper , and was also the Denkmalschutzamt &apos; , says Krischanitz and points to a raw language in the soil Untergeschoss . </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures , problems and improvements to the building has remained flexible and easily . </seg>
<seg id="753"> It was difficult with the pavilion , &quot; came the from Brussels , &quot; said Krischanitz recently , a typical &quot; Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> I am a architecture &quot; always in the wrong place &apos; and to &apos; give a real awareness . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case is the 21 House; but not in the wrong place , because it is an urban stroke of luck: the Swiss garden there is just the completely new planned &quot; Hauptbahnhofsquartier , with office and residential buildings . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck will be perhaps: The 21 s house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz-Bau , because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought out the Berlin art , and we hear that they negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden . </seg>

<seg id="836"> As a slap in the face , because the rapporteurship some Turkish media: &quot; Germany &apos;s gift for fifty TENs &apos; is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &quot; Haber X , &quot; the report the background of the non-Muslim; series . </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also Deutschlandausgabe &apos; Hürriyet &apos; it is not , take these intellectual link . </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot; It start to stink , &quot; is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci . </seg>
<seg id="839"> He stressed that people have been murdered , paid the taxes and would have done with their work is an important contribution to the rebuilding of Germany . </seg>
<seg id="840"> Extremely critical is being discussed in German Turkish Internet forums the actions of the police and the investigation later success . </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why it was not long before the German authorities either , to search for suspects in extreme right-wing circles , surprised the authors . </seg>
<seg id="842"> Some shows ready at least rhetorically to drastic measures: &quot; Will done carelessly , remains the migrants; no choice than the self-defense and the weapons . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot; This will be the best protect themselves . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot; By the quality of education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the internal peace in Germany , &quot; writes &quot; selenium . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="845"> What it means , if the internal peace in Germany in danger , goal--such the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties . </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photograph of the ruin of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish . </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event showed the Turks living here , it is clear that there is a current threat , and Germans--the that mistrust; and distance can result in right-wing violence . </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks , but the Wir-Gefühls knives on the Turkish side . </seg>
<seg id="849"> The mistakes of the past repeat </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press was criticised at the time , in particular , the failure of the German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln . </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President , represented at the funeral in Cologne but by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was on in his speech , as were many charges here the Turks . </seg>
<seg id="852"> Quite so , than the value of a berechne people after the height of his taxation delivery . </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again , is how deep distrust many German Turks in the European rule since then . </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs it this time , open-coordination words . </seg>
<seg id="855"> The scandal of the Bank Zürisee </seg>
<seg id="856"> The abenteuerlichste Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland . </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS in the financial crisis nearly bankrupt and slide since then from one crisis to another . </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it will be a German . </seg>
<seg id="859"> So it is certainly not intended Axel Weber . </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was leaked in July that he would take up a 2013 almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step . </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was publicly , praised the Switzerland; whether their beauty and the UBS over their newly acquired solidity and the1990 warm remarks about the future colleagues . </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot; The UBS has the Turnaround managed . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot; I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> But back in September , it was clear that everything would be quite different . </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader of UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and been around EUR 1,7 billion . </seg>
<seg id="866"> Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald Grübel , not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers , had to go . </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the Board of UBS , since , as has - and ask all: when will finally Axel Weber ? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Was already known that Weber may discuss the Bank of February 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the board , he is already in May - not only in 2013 , as the bank said on Tuesday . </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber , the hard . </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker , economics professor and central bankers and would have had a long time certainly needed . </seg>
<seg id="872"> With a stroke , he takes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank , which has once again demonstrated , that they have the title &quot; biggest Skandalbank of Europe &quot; deserves . </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and the slide for years by a scandal in the next . </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing , it seems , is spared the once so proud Swiss bank . </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started in the financial crisis . </seg>
<seg id="876"> By 2007 , the UBS has had an excellent reputation . </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the secretive and solid , but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters it had combined with ambitious objectives: you wanted to be in the investment banking a very large number . </seg>
<seg id="878"> So the UBS managed 2007 with $ 1,6 trillion more money high-net-worth customers than any other bank in the world . </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand it as investment bank in the League of the largest banks in the world . </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made impression . </seg>
<seg id="881"> Told the former bankers and later a professor banks in Zurich Hans right: &quot; my students I have presented the UBS at the time as a model of good bank . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot; Today , we wonder: how could I am wrong only ? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He wrongly huge . </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 , for the first time that something great schieflief in the UBS . </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year , Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising , who was by then as high intellectual and ingenious bankers . </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later it was , how he had gone . </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment in the bank , with Subprime-Papieren been and had to write off billions . </seg>
<seg id="888"> In order to shoulder the , the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs . </seg>
<seg id="889"> So it was actually investors , but which , on the gerümpft some until shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund , which was not the case that was not even his name . </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was only the first blow . </seg>
<seg id="891"> It was worse in April 2008 . </seg>
<seg id="892"> The Bank had to announce new billion losses , Board President Marcel Ospel , 2006 of the second best paid board of Switzerland , resigned . </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 , following the disaster: the UBS was given their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state . </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank , the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities , the Swiss Confederation , six billion francs for a forced change bond that they could be Miteigentümerin the Bank . </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole country was shocked , because she has said , as it is for a small country , if it so dramatically large banks . </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all , the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot; Once again , we could not save the UBS &apos; , says banks researchers right . </seg>
<seg id="898"> On the first disaster subscribed to the second . </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later surrendered in the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients , with the help of the bank had evaded taxes . </seg>
<seg id="900"> Also agreed to a payment of $ 780 million - as a repayment unjustified profits from these shops and Strafaufschlag . </seg>
<seg id="901"> So that doet the UBS more or less open , in the tax evasion . </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secretiveness--rooted . </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same . </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed the resignation of head and administration; Council President . </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of customers &apos; money . </seg>
<seg id="906"> Had lost the bank within a few months their credibility in two key business areas: in investment banking by the false speculation and in the asset management by the aid to tax evasion . </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just as it has been somewhat calmer , just as it was thought , will now get the UBS it again , because this is unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual traders been EUR 1,7 billion , before the bank , that something was wrong . </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it seems to be: in the risk management in the investment banking works out there are obviously still not . </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot; With the case Adoboli has to be said that has changed the risk control too little , &quot; says Martin Janssen , an economist and professor at the Institute of the University of Zurich . </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is sure of the UBS: &quot; The problem is that they do not control , the risk control . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> It was just the idea of caution , which were the Swiss bankers for a long time to be guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too many risks , and safety for money - was also collapse across the Alps of the world . </seg>
<seg id="912"> The coffers of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate . </seg>
<seg id="913"> The office of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the excellent Swiss private bank - yet it is just a little bit bigger . </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic; . </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße , from the Central Station , directly to the Zürichsee , of the will of the Letná summits of the Swiss mountains frames . </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are magnificent , , the shop rents are among the highest in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers as Tiffany &apos;s here between Swiss tradition , such as the Confiserie Sprüngli . </seg>
<seg id="918"> Stay here for centuries the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius bear . </seg>
<seg id="919"> The reception of the Hemicycle UBS is through a revolving door . </seg>
<seg id="920"> Are dressed in the marble walls , be thick leather chair , along with the logo of a great sign for &quot; safe . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer wants: security here . </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of Swiss Bank have both big Swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , has , however , eventually betrayed - or , as the head of a small Swiss private bank . </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name he would rather not read in the newspaper , finally , he , like all Swiss bankers , also deals with the two big banks . </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has become far too big , he - especially in investment banking , where would spread the Anglo-Saxons . </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss have nothing more to say . </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot; And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed , it was the Anglo-saxon investment banking , which changed the UBS , its only high profits , and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost in the Subprime-Dschungel as much money as the Swiss large bank . </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008 , the disaster was visible . </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot; On that Wednesday , the coalition government of the seven million small country the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation , &quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot; The UBS-Crash . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros approved the politicians , in order to save the bank before the bankruptcy . </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen ? </seg>
<seg id="932"> When you talk with Swiss bankers , so they see the problem , in the size of the UBS . </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 , up two of the three big Swiss banks to a huge company . </seg>
<seg id="934"> It was a bank , which has been in the merger was too large for the small Switzerland; - and further and further grew up . </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that the two different Vorläufer-Banken supplemented the UBS: a rich , but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer , but even more internationalized . </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly the globalised investment banker favourable much money , with which it is a huge wheel . </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli , president of the UBS from 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , the chairman of the board at the time . </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot; I always thought , Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team , &quot; says banks researchers Hans right . </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot; Wuffli , the intellectuals , Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics , and Ospel belly , the person who has worked , from the bank lesson to the top . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel have ended up on Wuffli . </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: &quot; He thought that his models were the reality , &quot; says sound right . </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot; This is a tragic case . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic , perhaps . </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: embolden came before the fall . </seg>
<seg id="945"> The UBS remember clearly to the Führungskräfte-Meetings on which to group chief Wuffli always have the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone . </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world . </seg>
<seg id="947"> It was the &quot; League Tables &apos; , the rankings , which documented the success of the banks that time . </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then wanted to UBS , after at the top . </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps were in it . </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the foreign exchange and stock in trade , with it at the top . </seg>
<seg id="951"> Business advisers who have been charged , stressed , however , a weakness: the international interest in business , the bankers , &quot; Fixed Income , &quot; there is a huge gap to the largest banks . </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products . </seg>
<seg id="953"> In order to close this gap , UBS in an adventure , which they almost cost the existence . </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth , both the Bank and invested a newly-established hedge funds in American Subprime-Anlagen before it . </seg>
<seg id="955"> It has become a huge machine , the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and , post-Napoleonic - but it also risks . </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also , as were other banks for the exit . </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot; Even in the summer of 2007 , when the American property market in flames , has bought the UBS there , &quot; says banks expert; right . </seg>
<seg id="958"> So great the euphoria , so deeply the case . </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after another had to go as compared with the attempts organization--one more difficult . </seg>
<seg id="960"> Items in the UBS were the weapon and are still shaky . </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who the bank now , has an almost impossible job . </seg>
<seg id="962"> He needs to find a strategy for a bank of all nearby business models are strangely . </seg>
<seg id="963"> Banks researchers right already has an idea: stop the investment banking , focus on asset management , return to the Swiss roots . </seg>
<seg id="964"> The bank will not (yet) go quite so far . </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment-banking activities should shrink sharply , it is already clear . </seg>
<seg id="966"> On Thursday to present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy . </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 -year-old Italo-Schweizer was intended only as a temporary solution , and divided the Bank is surprising of predecessors; Grübel . </seg>
<seg id="968"> Now authoritarian-would-be-democratic it: it is the business of UBS , told the Zurich Bank on Tuesday . </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the level in the mid-1990s . </seg>
<seg id="970"> 3500 posts cut it . </seg>
<seg id="971"> This will not be enough . </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision . </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it ? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What do they earn money ? </seg>
<seg id="975"> Those are the questions that is Axel Weber safe; now . </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly he says so far , only that he would seek with his wife in a home in Zurich . </seg>

<seg id="1015"> This is a remedy for the birds &apos; problem &apos; not yet in sight . </seg>

<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them , use helmets . </seg>
<seg id="1312"> We had opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday , because at this time are very few people in the Zucotti Park . </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation has been kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed and all the other thought initially to take part in an exercise . </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Police President Raymond W. Kelly was right in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges . </seg>
<seg id="1315"> As the onset of the events of the last few weeks has been blinded against protesters , in violation of the rules of the Dezernats and the Hausbesetzern an enormous growth in public clienteles , do not occur again . </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And so the police on the removal of the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of the planning and training . </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Officials had prepared this , by you , such as in other cities were handled . </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A Katastrophenübung had taken place with a view to Zuccotti ultra-peripheral space in Iceland . </seg>

<seg id="1322"> &quot; The few police officers , who I know were wateringdown , did not know that it came to the &apos;s Zuccotti Park , &quot; said someone who wishes to remain anonymous . </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot; The only , knew that it went to Zuccotti Park , the senior officials of the portfolios . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="1328"> &quot; It was appropriate to do so , when is the least number of people in the park , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Ambulances with Jupiterlampen and loud speakers , prior to the departure of the Pike panties and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge . </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The light bulbs and the first recorded news , the dröhnten from the loud speakers , rail brow-beat many protesters . </seg>
<seg id="1331"> As broke the public officials in their bright blue Windjacken in the park , rafften together many protesters simply their belongings and left the place . </seg>
<seg id="1332"> The police said that no tents would be touched until 1:45 p.m. , in order to give the Protestlern time , their homes and possessions together . </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of officials were seen as they collected in the environment to intervene , should be arrests in the park . </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Reporters have been forced to leave the park . </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne , spokesman for the police chief; , said that this has happened to their own security . </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists say that they wanted to hold them , the police actions in the park to see , and they said , the way in which the officials is very harsh . </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that Fernsehwagen in the Church Street on the west side of the parks; photographs could have . </seg>

<seg id="1342"> Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp did ancient in her arms . </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people would chain themselves to trees , said Mr Kelly . </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Civil protection officials were called , they loszuschneiden . </seg>
<seg id="1345"> As Mr Kelly has said , there have been no arrests until around 3:30 p.m. in the park . </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes . </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in Park . </seg>
<seg id="1348"> To most of the arrests took place , as he said , because &quot; disorderly conduct and resisting arrest . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski , department head of the Detectives , was also there . </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Despite his presence &apos; , &quot; Mr Kelly &quot; not the operation , &quot; said Mr Browne . </seg>
<seg id="1352"> In the event that they should have access , a second group of officials from the eastern side of the Broadway , between Liberty and Cedar Street . </seg>
<seg id="1353"> In the Cortlandt Street , a road block north of the parks , and in the Pine Street , a block further south , built barricades; . </seg>

<seg id="1361"> Trade union the guide; will because redundancy; lodge a complaint against the city </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The trade union , the hundreds of Schulbetreuern who have lost their jobs last month , , is planning to sue the city on Wednesday , as the redundancies; because of undue influence on the schools , keep the poor students , are not necessary and discriminatory . </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The complaint is probably the last opportunity , the trade union , local 37 , in their efforts , the redundancy; to reverse--North , still is open . </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer , care coordinators and other staff who are the worst paid employees of the city , and had lost on 7 October in a move their work , have described the trade union leaders and political revenge for that last year the city of access to a health fund , which had the working groups , had refused to close the budget gap . </seg>
<seg id="1365"> These accusations have been flatly rejected by the authorities . </seg>
<seg id="1366"> Said at a hearing of the council Dennis M. Walcott , director of the schools , last month , the redundancies are part of the budget that we have in June . </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the City Council shot back and told him that spezifiziere in the budget that would be off the Schulhilfe . </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials said the city of 37 , they would have and warned the Ministry of Education , a complaint; on Wednesday there will be a press conference to be announced the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally . </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The complaint , Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as defendants list and count eight laid-off workers as the plaintiff , which are all color or Latin American women , as most of the workers who have lost their jobs . </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas , a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city , said that the city would be the case not and therefore could not comment on their individual claims . </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a complaint before the draft , the New York Times , the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city , in order to support a complaint alleging discrimination , claiming that would have lost poor schools more workers , because they are chronically under-funded . </seg>
<seg id="1372"> It points out that , while there was no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in schools &apos;s Upper East Side or TriBeCa , 17 Schulhelfer district in 23 in Louisville , Brooklyn Brown , have lost and 46 workers were made redundant in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx . </seg>
<seg id="1373"> With the adoption of the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern , in the 36 public school in Harlem , where 68 percent of students live in poverty , were employed , says the case: &quot; This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents , can organise the donations to offset budget cuts . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.S.: the budget of the 36 th southern has been cut this year by 3,26 , and lost money , as the city changed its method of calculation for the extra funding for any poor school enrolment . </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in the memo , which approved the release of care coordinators . </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo used the English word &quot; excess &quot; to describe the act , even if quot; excess &apos;: hand) in the United States is typically the change of a teacher of the payroll at a school in a pool of available workers , who are paid by the central office . </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot; Sixty care coordinators have been made redundant , not handed over , &quot; says the complaint . </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission ended , Congress prepared to agree on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It ultimately looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington already , in terms of the uprisings in Libya . </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All , was what we needed , was the success of the revolt , the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and an end to the American interference . </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday , the Committee for international relations of the Senate a resolution , which the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is , with Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their &quot; courage &quot; Brittan; . </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot; This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya , which started with the reconstruction of their country , &quot; said Kerry . </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot; It is a validation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may sound innocent , but so far nothing was simply in the Libya debate . </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer strove legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the US military &apos;s role in the Libyen-Mission ΝΑΤΟ . </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June , Kerry and McCain a resolution , which approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya . </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote . </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day , this law in the Senate by the chamber . Right-by-right outvoted a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya . </seg>
<seg id="1389"> This US , the mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress , which was upset enough to criticise Obama &apos;s approach within the mission , but not angry enough to him once and for all the rug from under our feet . </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events . </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October . </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October . </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate may be willing to take action . </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee for international relations &quot; congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their exceptional perseverance in their own liberation &quot; and &quot; praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners , the support of the military operations to protect the people of Libya , for their exceptional courage and professionalism . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also repeated &quot; the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya &apos;s transition to democracy . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measures will receive the full support of the board to foreign relations or they will be the -legislators divide , as it has done the law in June ? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The final version is resistance on the part of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen-Republikaner of the committee . </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he so far have not yet seen the final version of the new law . </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The Capitol , the onus is on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment , which calls for a balanced budget , a top priority in almost every Congress , the Republicans and some Democrats . </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other sector , which is the time to vote in the Senate or Congress . </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have been trying unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote , although they have tried often enough . </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented this Congress and include a whole range of issues . </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are twice - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - other , are only slightly . </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung alone in the Senate and a controls--another dozen , the &apos; federal spending would control &quot; . </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are different , but they give their customers - especially in the two Republicans , their CV want - the opportunity to boast about , that that they have such a measure &quot; drafted; &quot; . </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Haushaltskontrollgesetz , which was approved in August , requires that both Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the increased at all; . </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March 58 senators have not voted for a binding resolution , which supports the idea of such a change . </seg>
<seg id="1408"> On the budget , want to some members of the number of provisions , can present the members of Congress , limit , while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms in office of the President . </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee , among other things , the right to a good education and health care . </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment that prohibits a marriage of equals forgender , as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags , a recurring . </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators want to allow for the lifting of federal laws , if not two thirds of the states . </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So keen , as the members suggest changes , so incomparably faster they move as in recent years . </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111 th Congress , before legislators 77 such changes in the 110 th Congress in 66 . </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace pales in comparison with that of the early 1990 s , in which were members of more than 150 changes every two years , so the figures , which is the Senate library . </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they were not too much more successful than today &apos;s . </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last change that needs to be added - the 27 th - , was ratified in 1992 , but has in fact already proposed to Congress in 1789 . </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &apos; , but not defeated , &quot; Giffords in the first television interview after the attack </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after an armed man from next indeed; during an election event in Tucson on they had shot , the Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) on Monday evening on national television . Alone; they sang the Broadway-Stück &apos; The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow &quot; and said that the desire to recover , is greater than the returning to Congress . </seg>
<seg id="1419"> As they , together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-Nachrichten &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; occurred , they struggled for words and needed help in walking . </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The programme was the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet , the shared her skull , durchbohrt the left side of her brain and has broadened its head from start to finish , has done . </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago , she returned surprising in the Congress to make their voice heard on Schuldenbremse triumphantly . </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In her first television interview after the attack in January , which killed six people and injured 13 , smiling Gifford , laughed and song - and described their recovery as &quot; difficult . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> As Sawyer they asked how they feel , said Gifford (41): &quot; quite well . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and her husband , the astronauts Mark Kelly , was part of a one-hour &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; -Specials , which was recorded just before the publication of the new book of the couple: &quot; Gabby: a story of courage and hope . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January . </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos , the Kelly recorded in the first few weeks , you see it in the hospital bed , with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on the face . </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It can only one or two fingers , if her husband it encouraged . </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later , Giffords in a wheelchair , while therapists , showing them how simple movements . </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nodding head with the Oxfam-International . </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A twitch with the lips . </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then , their first words: &apos; what &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After a few days ago whispering Giffords is another word , &quot; Confusion . &quot; They want to , that will change their breakfast . </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos , in the ABC-Show , show that music played an important role in Giffords &apos; recovery: It is , as the members of Congress who , together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers &quot; Girls Just Wanna Have Fun &quot; and to Tom Pettys quot; Free Fallin &apos; &quot; singing . </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Said in the interview with Sawyer Giffords , the therapy will spend two hours a day , that they can not remember on the day of the attack . </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that Giffords on 12 March an article in a newspaper on the attack had , when it cut off , and for the first time after the six people asked , which had been killed during the attack . </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and will forcibly treated , while he was waiting for his trial . </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot; Many people have died , &quot; Giffords told Sawyer . </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot; Hard , hard , hard . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the course of the recovery of his wife , Kelly told Sawyer , she said: &quot; I was taken . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot; So , I would say: &apos; Gabby , you President; defeated not ? &apos; , &quot; said Kelly . </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You President; taken only . </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you will go through it and you will you recover and you will come back stronger than ever before . </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops feel more sympathy than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street-Gala , collected the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City . </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness , frustration and loss . </seg>
<seg id="1446"> On cue hundred soldiers , sailors , pilots and marines gathered around him . </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded . </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot; The servicemen and women were seen as heroes , &quot; said David Saltzman , who organised the effort in the spring . </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer at the gala , which among other things , the chief of staff and former chairman , has been observed Admiral Mike Mullen , the role of the troops . </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot; They were introduced as orphans , &quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail . </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organisers have said it well . </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that . </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But there was no respect , not really , it was pity; . </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and of the most distant , sometimes admiring American public . </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops are showered with praise for their victims . </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has a price , service members . </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly so , as would the people in uniform suffering . </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot; We were not victims , &quot; said brigade Fiscalía Sean example MacFarland , the troops in Iraq or free and will soon go to Afghanistan . </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot; But it seems that the only way the support that is , in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is very sensitive for military leaders , not ungrateful or in the dispute with the public they serve , to appear . </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also recognise that the anger , the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War , was much worse . </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result there are discussions on pity; in the Pacific and private sector between war veterans . </seg>
<seg id="1463"> With his two sons returned from fighting with the marines , warned the retired Colonel Mark Cancian it that could see people outside the military world their service from two different perspectives . </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would see it with a sense of reverence , as they defeated rebels and went to exotic places . </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would ask whether a &quot; angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , &quot; said Cancian , who had fought in Iraq and has taken on his return a key state posts in Washington . </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his job search , he said , he felt that they obtain some of the interviewer subtly , whether he is in a position to withstand immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington . </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot; If you only talk about your service , you need the negative impressions are fighting , &quot; declared Cancian his sons . </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The lack of ease of the American military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war . </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Services will be on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and only see little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , only rarely as encomia singled out . </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot; We as a nation , not military heroism more so , as it was in the Second World War , absolutely , &quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno retired , inspired the US troops in Afghanistan . </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead , the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of service members . </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops find recognition for the number of attacks , which they have endured , the number of friends that they have lost or for the severity of their injuries . </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Military is under growing pressure from the crackdown in rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week is an important hearing on whether to be indicted 28 men and women for failing to intervene in a rape in the military court . </seg>
<seg id="1475"> It should not happen , there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing . </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers . </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and they just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego the dinner with a friend , when they met at a male colleagues , the one he Pack; beer in 12 . </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked them , whether he is likely to accompany them along a drink in her room . </seg>
<seg id="1479"> My alarm went to &quot; , &quot; Lyman said . </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns . </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: &apos; Oh , no , he is 19 . </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas , &quot; she said . </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot; I wish I had listened to my gut instincts . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after they were taken to Lymans Zimmer , the man behind it , put it down and raped them , it claims . </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week , on 18 November , wait; Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington , Virginia , which will decide whether a complaint , it against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , have made , will be allowed in court . </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The complaint alleges that Gates and not Rumsfeld against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers . </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Rose to 28 in February by Susan Burke , a lawyer in Washington , D.C. , the complaint initially covered 17 claimants , but in the coming months:25 women and three men , all of which claim that they were raped by Soldatenkollegen or sexually abused , and that the military failed to identify , condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks , available to it . </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says she has the top military leadership , as will the problem there . </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot; The military is hierarchical , &quot; she says . </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot; Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retaliate; of ? The leadership . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that she has contacted since February approximately 400 more survivors , many of them could be part of future complaints . </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Their strategy: instead of all the plaintiff adduces lay their eggs in one basket , they will , if necessary , many more complaints , in order to maintain the pressure . </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence , led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride , has made an application to reject . </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The files of the court , the Newsweek , in detail the defence strategy , primarily for the military , not of current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for injuries , which have occurred in the armed forces . </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Because of a law of the Supreme Court , which dates from 1950 , the so-called Feres-Doktrin , the government is not responsible for violations , the soldiers on active service . </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot; The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs , &quot; states the document . </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story . </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950 s . </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are not permitted to service is still in the fight , it is the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts . </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Team of female soldiers increasingly important roles to play in both Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly in the contact with local women in the war zones . </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between the two wars , 150 soldiers have died , two thirds of them in hostilities . </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that will modernize the military , says Burke . </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And it is not alone in their struggle as: three further complaints are out of their pending . </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School , the veteran &apos; Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four most important military colleges because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere . </seg>
<seg id="1505"> This is independent of the voluntary Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military , to be out the diagnosis &quot; personality disorder &quot; focused , received the rape victims , in order to release them from the service - a way in which the activists as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women &apos;s Action Network , a human rights group . </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Their group was in December complaint against the veteran administration (of .: management of war veterans), in which they did their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people , saying the , have been sexually abused in the service . </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties submitted to the Congress , which will provide a number of leads . </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 , according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (sposi .: Department of Defense Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) 3.158 sexual abuses . </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But the majority of the abuses are not reported at all and , after the own estimate of the Pentagon takes account of this number around 13,5 per cent of the estimated 19.000 cases , which it per year . </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report , which was published in March , is also examining the Strafverfolgungsraten:2010 was 20 percent of the cases in the military , only half as many as in the civil law in court . </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in Burke &apos;s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of non-newsworthy . </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the police less than an hour after the attack . </seg>
<seg id="1513"> In the night , she says , has been asked it 11 times , the details of the rape of a number of police officers , doctors and to tell commanders . </seg>
<seg id="1514"> They had a rape set and the blood of the shooter that arose from a cut on his arm , was found in her bed . </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later , in April 2009 , was heard by a judge . Lyman during this hearing was asked after the sex , they had before the attack with her friend . </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people have said , as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was acquitted . </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot; I well remember the day when the verdict was read out , &quot; Lyman says . </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot; I thought the labor would use . I ran screaming from the courtroom . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot; They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that I , when I go back to my commander , said: this was not his procedure . That was my procedure . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman has been invited to visit a military psychiatrist , a personality disorder diagnosed and said for service . </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 , it was honorably discharged , so that they have no support . </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint , the Lyman and the other plaintiff , have tabled , is pure speculation , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School . </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nonetheless , it says: &quot; in my opinion they should move forward . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a judgment , is this doctrine , criticised the will , for the first time since she was called into question . </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am a critic of the time life Feres-Doktrin . </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is lagging behind a decade , because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence , which is a liability . </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &quot; The chances are against it ... but it is important for them that they try it . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will only change , if good people are ready to fight . </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the hearing is not their way , Burke , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , start with hundreds of other plaintiff for future cases . </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot; We will continue our struggle against the military in this regard , until it comes to reforms , &quot; she says . </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die , whatever the first disposal; . </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: how researchers you watch on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before he was a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe , was Anders Behring Breivik , only one of many boys , which was its anti-immigration views online . </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday had Breivik , who has been , in a killing spree in Norway in July , in which 77 people were killed , his first public court hearing . </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik may have acted alone , he is not far from alone in cyberspace;: he has spent much time until his attack on his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists , support the extreme right-wing groups on social networks . </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people . </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But as we find them ? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This is easy - we must EUDemocrats.org only on Facebook . </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot; We have found that it was not difficult , to go to them , &quot; says Jamie Bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks and personal data is so enzyklopädisch , says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply Werbetool the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - as do retailers for years . </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team was half a million fans of far-right groups in Europe and visierte to them with Adds , but rather than with a new collar; or to set a new diet product , have invited the Adds users to a survey in which , after their level of education , was asked its attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future . </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook , Bartlett and his colleagues were in a position to more than 10.000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even once her office that they would have had to leave . </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot; It is a fairly new research method , &quot; says Bartlett . </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results hardly surprising . Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young , male and resent the immigration . </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a kind of surprising mispresentation &quot; those who their online activism with a Offline-Aktivismus combine sensible , democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to welcome a new tool in the hands of scientists . </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Ideas; factories , medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to society; trends such as &quot; Likes &apos; , text messages and status updates . </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users , which add an average of three content per day , generated Facebooks &quot; data supernova explosion &quot; a research multiplier-accelerator , the number of scientific work under the name of this side in the title in the last five years by almost 800% increase . </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is the fact that we can study this side people , you normally with his Clipboard not achieved in the streets . </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot; If you tried to ask people to the British National Party , earlier , it was very difficult to identify them . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot; They were the first party and which would have given them never access , &quot; says Bartlett . </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &apos; on Facebook is a everything away - you will go directly to them . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve . </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook , significantly more problem drinking are as students who remained silent on this issue . </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno proposes that equal students , for example , the Wohnberater , monitor and help a postet these students , if too many status updates . </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot; You can &apos;t solve a problem , if you have not recognized , &quot; said Dimitri Christakis , Morenos Ko-Autor and director of the Child Health , Behavior and Development at Seattle Children &apos;s Research Institute of the Washington Post . </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot; We have found a way to identify children at risk , the different; had not been found . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also zapft constantly the data of its own people . </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The data team has statistics on the side of the relationship status and Valentine &apos;s Day , the turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National bliss-inducing index (which have been used in the first place , has only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have known for a long time that should make the side their great data treasure trove for other for research purposes .) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But the users of Facebook , know that the side they observed , whether they like it or not . With a friend , which is thousands of miles away , to play Scrabble , the side &apos;s own personal data will be allowed . </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook part of a survey that they do not even know something ? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have strict guidelines laid down , as they collect their data offline , is online . </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot; I do not believe that many users are reflecting on the fact that researchers have their profiles could study , &quot; says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab , a study in 2006 , in which he investigated the public sides of students on Facebook . </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot; What they are concerned , it was only for them and their friends . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology . </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline , there is no guarantee that is a research participants absolutely honest . </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook , it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a profile and in contributions are true . </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot; What you on Facebook says and what we do outside of Facebook , are two completely different things , &quot; says Selwyn . </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore , Selwyn despite his years as a technology that researchers are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools , can use the each . </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot; There is no substitute for it to go in the real world and to speak with real people , &quot; he says . </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot; Social research must take care of the social aspects - lots and lots of social life is still offline . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot; Cold and inhuman &quot;: Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Behring Breivik , the man , the two Amokläufe differently , in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway , turned himself in his first appearance before a public court described as a &quot; resistance &quot; kämpfer in Oslo . </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot; I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple of Norway , &quot; he said in a court room with more than 500 people . </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot; I object to the court , because you have had your mandate of organisations , the hatred ideologies; support and is supported by the Multi-culturalism . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot; I recognise the laws , but I confess I am not guilty . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judges Torkjel Nesheim off Breivik during this monologue , &quot; because he did not want to Breivik , the possibility that this hearing to use as a platform on which he can express his views . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he Breivik , the speech mitbrachte compiled an advance , permission , at the end of the hearing to speak to the relatives of his victims . </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered that the police further Breivik for 12 weeks in custody , he has four weeks do not have access to the media , he said that the authorities all visits and all the correspondence about eight weeks will be closely monitoring . </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing . </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some , in the hope that Breivik in the eyes can see other wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars . </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All participated with the aim that everything on a Wegschließen . </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot; I thought he was cold and inhuman , &quot; a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK . </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot; It was uncomfortable , but for me it is a little further , after I have seen and heard the suspect . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and , throughout the hearing calmly and professionally , he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes , as he entered and left the building . </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breiviks bizarrem saying that he would be part of a larger &quot; resistance &quot; bewegung , the judge came to the conclusion that he is not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he would have had accomplices . </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It may have some that the attacks of 22 July , the work of a single extremists and this was not a radical group . </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But relieved that automatically the heartache and the confusion that feels a whole nation still ? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot; I wish that he would like a monster , but that does not do it , &quot; said the family of a victim . </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot; It would be so much easier if he did . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons from the interviews with the late Steve Jobs , was shown this week in a theatre </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Compared to the death of Steve Jobs on October 5 , some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology; genius as a great modern inventors . </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What are Apple-Fans but perhaps the most in the recently discovered Jobs-Interview , which has been dusted off this week before special film displays on the major markets , is how has this very creative head; business processes and procedures . </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer , a dreamer and even appointed Hippie , but he was also a meticulous detail organizer , the bastelte to Diagrammen - a man who believed that many business leaders &quot; a disease of thought , &apos; that &apos; is a really great idea 90 per cent of the work ... [ but ] there is a huge amount of craft-type art between a great idea and a great product . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> 1995 , Bob Cringely the TV series &apos; triumph of the computer . Fachidioten &quot; with the dawn of the staff and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs , in the one of the rare , detailed talks led . </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time were passed over 10 years , since then had been pushed jobs; from Apple , and already he was working hard on his new computer companies NeXT , and looked forward to the broad adoption of the Internet . </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While used a small part of Cringleys interview in specialist idiots , he says that the lack of Kopiervorlagen interviews in the supply . </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Only after Jobs death discovered a full VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director . </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This easy; revised film material is the basis for the 68 film of &quot; Steve Jobs: The Lost interview , &quot; which is this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater . </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who is known for its extensive interviews , jobs here surprisingly busy in its technological philosophies and business strategies . </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly pause . </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interview it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen , where jobs is clearly his thoughts balance and accuracy . </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are moments in which jobs &apos; perfect days , when he apparently impatiently awaiting Cringelys issues to react and it anschubst , faster on issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance . </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Before the era of Pixar , iPod or iPhone seems somehow that people interview included far-sighted , if jobs , what other companies with him right or wrong and its own vision for the future of the computer . </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is a thing; posthumous awards the career jobs &apos; to read , but jobs here as the thrill of greedy dreamer to see , which is on the leap to the grandeur , is something quite different , original and inspiring . </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things could be and should be . </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Shortly after he had said all this here , he drew and made it . </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the Verlorenen interviews: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> As he learned to lead a company: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot; Throughout the years in the business I always ask , &quot; Why are you doing things ? &quot; And the answer , you always get is , &apos; Oh , it will be easy . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Who knows why he does what he is doing , nobody in the business to think very carefully about things . </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I have noticed that . </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs continues its efforts to streamline from , the accounting; Apple . </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Were amazed to see costs recorded - predominantly began with &quot; Standardkosten &quot; , the mere suspicion been costed and which were then adapted with &quot; deviation &quot; - it developed an automated factory , who ensured that the recurring costs until the regulations could be determined . </seg>
<seg id="1615"> As has been veralbert the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs; told of the &quot; Blue Box , &quot; which he has built with Steve Wozniak , a device , with the people in the telephone company creep and could lead to talks in vain . </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Has been on the machine , but jobs enthusiasm , as he describes the bluebox as an act of Selbstbemächtigung , is contagious . </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he Wozniak and test the box; would , by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone , and then working a phone call from a AT in another , while it so many durchschleifen satellites as possible . </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot; We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if we grölte into the phone , came a minute later in the telephone next door , &quot; said kichernd jobs . </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot; We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves , can control the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We both , we did not know much , but we were able to build this small things that can monitor a huge thing , it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them . </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Sake; tells us further away from a glorious gimmick , the Wozniak and he almost made have withdrawn , in the middle of the night via bluebox in the Vatican phoning and wanted to talk with the Pope , while it as far as they could Henry Kissinger nachmachten . </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to have been called in to speak with the American diplomats , the two loslachen , before the Pope to the telephone . </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As he is in the technology; president (Bill Hewlett and unprepared dispute): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 , when it was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters , he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him . </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20 -minute telephone call , jobs for the summer work part-time in Hewlett-Packard . </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot; This has had a remarkable impact on me and it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company; and how well his staff treated . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later , Jobs one of the HP-Mitarbeiter , the corporation &apos;s research laboratories in Palo Alto visited; , where he was &quot; the first Desktop-Computer , of the ever produced . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase , had a small screen with Braunscher tunnel and I admitted in him . </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would take the HP upwards as a teenager , and are committed to this machine and programmes for they write . </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How innovation improved: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview , jobs , how do we invent spontaneously new products . </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Some boards early in his career , when he einbaute , he was asked by a customers , the whole computers to assemble them . </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He was working with a payment period of only 30 days and both had to rethink the processes and the extradition of the earth-orbiting equipment . </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later in Apple is he is reminiscent of the problems , which he had in the development of a mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot; I remember quick-dispersing arguments ... you cried to me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] and I was on , went out and found a manufacturer . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later we had a mouse , we have to build for $ 15 , which was incredibly credible . </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies that continue: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he Apple lead , saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants with their vision in founder and lost control of their shares . </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot; We say , you are working with IBM , Xerox , make you a better room or printer , so what ? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> They have the equities--were monopoly , is not the company more successful . </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing such people make it successful , so [ there are ] , which ultimately lead the company and the product , with which people are being pushed out of the decision-making process . </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product genius that has led to this monopoly , will of the people who have no concept of good products versus bad products , stamping-out - craft-type art . </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This happened in Xerox ... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox would have the whole computer industry . </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could have been ten times greater , could have been the Microsoft of the 1990 s ... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have caught the defeat by the victory . </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot; It is a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product ... when we have these great idea , changing it developed and is growing . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> We are learning a lot about his legalisms . </seg>
<seg id="1651"> It must be votes , certain things that you can &apos;t do , but electrons , glass , machines; factories . </seg>
<seg id="1652"> We must mark 5000 things , these concepts , and bring it all together ... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Ultimately it is tantamount to the taste , it comes down to is that an attempt is being made with the best stuff that people have created , and then tried to bring these matters to the together , what you do . </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal . </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We are always shamelessly stealing in the great ideas . </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there , musicians , poets , artists , Zoologen , historian who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world . </seg>
<seg id="1657"> It would not have been in the computer business , they would create fantastic things in other areas . </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health legislation , as a court case over-accepting </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political part of the question as to whether it will hear a challenge to the health legislation by President Obama , two of its judges , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , part of a dinner , which was of the firm gesponsort that will take the case to court . </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday , and met all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration . </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases was a complaint , the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care , which were decided last year by Congress , a law that has been in the conservative activists everywhere in the US the catchphrase . </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to the hearing in March and is expecting a 5 1 / 2 -hour basis for discussion , which probably the result will probably increase the presidential campaign of 2012 , at the time , which will give the court decision , will be in full swing . </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will argue in court , and that is to overturn the law , will probably be Paul Clement , once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush . </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements Office; , Bancroft PLLC , was one of the nearly two dozen companies , which supported the annual dinner of the Federal society , an ancient group , which the defence non-socialist legal principles . </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company , which represents the dinner has sponsored , Jones Day , one of the business , the National Federation of Independent Business , the challenge the law . </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc . , which is involved in the outcome of the process . </seg>

<seg id="1668"> Service , among other things , Mitch McConnell , the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health reform </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The guests of the dinners ? Scalia and Thomas . </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: the two judges visit events organised by the Federal society for years . </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And it is not against moral rules . </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact , to judge by the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts . </seg>
<seg id="1673"> They were , they would probably fall within principle 4 c of the code , which states: &quot; A judge can participate in the near fundraising law and other organisations , with the judge not a spokesperson , Khadaffi or according to programme must not be a guest of such events . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless , the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case with the related firms , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this , in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten . </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot; This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code of the complaints of some judges lie , the court is to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , &quot; said Bob Edgar , president of the common cause-célèbre , a civil rights movement in the United States . </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot; The judges , and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending procedure on court . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable . </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say that they would court matter too easily with groups that are off the agenda , such as the Federal society; mix . </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the Thomas &apos; wife Ginni is a known conservative activist . </seg>
<seg id="1680"> However , the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan , who have a moral problem , not Scalia and Thomas . </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was General prosecutor under the Obama administration , as the first legal challenges in the first instance in court . </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Their critics , Kagan , withdraw itself from the hearing of the case because of bias , since it is very committed to the defence of the law , in order to be impartial . </seg>

<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Development Bank , India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis , in order to prevent a long-term downward trend , which will slow down the growth of the economy in Asia . </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag , managing director of the ADB , based in Manila , said that the two fastest growing economies in the world &quot; everything in your power &quot; need to do to the recovery of the currency bloc either by the International Monetary Fund or to speed up through direct mutual agreements . </seg>

<seg id="1736"> Could the mounting debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies need to get together , in order to support the eurozone . </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag said that any support of Asia is channelled through the IMF , but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU-Rettungsfonds , the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners in Asia greater bargaining power offer . </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma , the Indian Trade Minister , said that &quot; India is going to do everything in its power &quot; to help the eurozone , now that the economy is suffering from the falling exports and drying up foreign capital flows . </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled a Congress on Monday , as he warned that would weaken automatic budget cuts the national security , and he delivered a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon &apos;s to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts . </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon carefully already cuts of $ 450 trillion over the course of the next decade , harsh; now but that further cuts $ 600 trillion or more will be necessary if the Congress can not reach a conclusion in the spending . </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot; The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry , &quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain , Arizona , and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina . </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement , which will lead to a so-called seizure , would lead to 23 general cuts and an end of many new projects . </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot; Such a high reduction , carried out on such indiscriminate way , would make the most of our shipping and construction projects unviable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other urbanization--is seriously harm , &quot; Panetta wrote to the senators . </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot; We would also be forced to get rid of a lot of our civilian staff involuntarily to and , since the reduction would be implemented so quickly , we would almost certainly civilians; furlough , in order to be able to achieve the objective . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot; These changes would destroy the faith of those who our military maintained and damage our alert seriously . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts were ultimately take the combat forces , &quot; Panetta said . </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot; Are not affected during the war , in the fight against terrorism by the seizure , would influence the serious interference in the budget of the war effort , &quot; Panetta warned . </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot; Staff attitudes were being cut , leading to delays in the attitudes and the attitude , who support the war , would lead . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot; The salaries of staff would be cut to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence . </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot; The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would take a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot; We are strongly against this draconian action , &quot; the senators said in a joint statement published on Monday afternoon , when they Panettas letter . </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot; This is a result that we cannot live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on us . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot; The confiscation is a threat to national security interests of the United let us create and their commitment should not be allowed . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings from the senators the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon of cuts , remains to be seen . </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly outspoken the possible cuts , although he could have many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House , before he came to the top of the Pentagon &apos;s , and that he is serious decisions . </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference in the last week , the defence minister a gloomy picture , which could face - a military with skin , but without nuclear . </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot; It is a ship without sailors . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot; It is a brigade without ammunition . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot; It is a squadron without sufficient trained pilots . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot; It is a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to meet the mission , &quot; Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon . </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot; It is an armed force , there is a lack of morality and alert and it is not in the position , with potential opponents . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot; It will be a really angry . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led to Panetta new details , such as reductions &quot; self-creating significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis , conflicts and disasters , serious restrictions on our global nature; and intervention capability , which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that could be some of the biggest defence projects of the victims , including those that have been tested and are already in the early planning stage . </seg>
<seg id="1777"> To this list also includes the fight , F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a planned new bombs , the next generation of ballistic submarines , the new Ship our , and the new ground vehicle , the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee . </seg>
<seg id="1778"> We would stop the further development and testing of the F35 , this would be in the next 10 years to save $ 80 trillion , but the supporters say , that it is an important next step to armaments; , so that can be possible dangers posed by China and other opponents carefully; . </seg>

<seg id="1780"> A look at the current headlines , as serious and widespread deception and mensonge in everyday life . </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Of the Republican presidential candidate , Herman Cain , is to be the accusations of sexual harassment by several women Mr . Both sides accuse each other of lying . </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The leadership of Penn State is accused of &apos;s , as has been the supposedly reports , which has used a retired football coach boys sexually . </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In the last week has been mitangehört on an open microphone , as claimed the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama , the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar . </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers and shake countries . </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York members of Congress and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner , fools , as he expressed renunciations into circulation , which were refuted; very quickly by indisputable evidence . </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the struggle-campaigns funding , which is linked to the cover-up of an extramarital affair . </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then , of course , no one who has seen the media circus , which President Bill Clinton , as he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky . </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread . </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been incidents in which teachers have set their students the answers , so that they were cast itself in their performance on tests . </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors , who teach the contrary should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay; . </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception we see ? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> We as studies show , lie between 10 and 200 times every day . </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Many of these lies are valid but as lies . </seg>
<seg id="1794"> One other study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting . </seg>
<seg id="1795"> To learn lies to Milosevic--and or &quot; lies &quot; is a , which is important for all people , both personal and professional reasons . </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a parlor game such as host Aden , where it is the goal , &quot; property you ! &quot; RethinkHIV , is the Enttarnen a deception a serious know , based on scientific data that has been collected over the past six decades to prestigious universities that had extensive research projects , particularly in the areas of psychology and physiology . </seg>
<seg id="1797"> The result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been revealed . </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies a balance--or in the eyes . </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They even , fumbling , reddening and zappeln not always . </seg>
<seg id="1800"> This however , it is not that difficult to identify and are these liars . </seg>
<seg id="1801"> An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth , about the structure of the claim that the fine of emotion-related facial expressions , sex-texting on issue and timing . </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I have spent several years , the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of drug-dealers . And it is clear that this is a Enttarnen deception a modern ability , which is easy to learn and helps us in the right in our complex world , especially if the withdrawal or the questioning of persons or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities . </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are very good , other people to know their interests and their own emotions to dominate , and they feel intuitively , how they are perceived by others . </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research , we know the extrovertierte people lie more than introvertierte people that men more &apos; itself , &quot; lies for than women , whose lies more &apos; other &apos; - usually they want to protect the feelings - that married people their partner lying less often than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell , are often &quot; big lies &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that , if a person as a culprit was revealed , others feel less guilty , this person to have lied . </seg>
<seg id="1806"> As you can see , whether someone is lying ? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First , you see the normal behaviour this person . </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &apos; Baselining &apos; , the position . </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It is a reference-point later on the assessment of changes before . </seg>
<seg id="1810"> You watch the attitude , the laughter , the Stimmqualität their attempt . </seg>
<seg id="1811"> They should know better , when someone usually constantly with the foot behind , so that they do not unfairly , if he during a meetings with the foot behind . </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then you pay attention to accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviors . </seg>
<seg id="1813"> If you look at these accumulations as bells , the strident , not as proof of a exposing . </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who deceive , congealing , perhaps , if they try to remember their history and perhaps have their feet in the door or they are in the direction out-come , change their position in a significant way or show a &quot; relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch , this deep , &quot; entspannende of and the change in the position that if all the hard questions are over . </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One-centre signal often wrongly , that a Einstellungsgespräch is over , only to this détente after the Einstellungsgespräch . </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also respect you on the language you subject . </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Only by Scott Peterson is famous , as he used the past tense , as he claimed that his wife was killed on the live and a national search for her . </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Deceptive people can also use a sporadic language: &quot; I had no sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky affairs &quot; or if a vexed question repeatedly in its entirety . </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most frequent verbal signs are subtly . </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use &quot; qualifying language , &quot; if they answer a vexed question: &quot; Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know is ... in good faith and conscience . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This will be the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual , which often set the alarm bells ringing . </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic to the Enttarnen of lies , but we can learn skills , thanks to which a exposing is possible . </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Thanks to these skills anyone can become a victim of defrauders less often , both in the private and professional life . </seg>

<seg id="2062"> If we have two or three song , which we have long been not played , recorded in the repertoire , we maintain our focus better and they can surprise us , because they are the reasons why , we like this song , otherwise they could be forgotten . </seg>

<seg id="2072"> What it meant for you , to have actively participated in the birth of the way ? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honour to be part of this group of large band . </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are good with the people of Sound Guards , friends Mudhoney and Alice in Chains . </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising and very unusual , if a movement from a group of friends . </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Now and then , a bond from a city , but it is unusual , if five or ten groups at the same time from the same city . </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group . </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes we still play together . </seg>

<seg id="2084"> A familiar with the others and its music , and it could not be better off . </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with fame has not always been easy , on the other hand , why their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a . </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How is it a balance ? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The way in which we are up to , has made it easier for ourselves , to find a balance . </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We are sure , not to be too often on tour , because it is too easy to forget this game with huge numbers of people who love your music , to escheat . </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as we keep in mind that the people are because of the music here , it reminds you that you , the music and what it has created , respected , without being too keen to be a famous rock star , which has never interested in us . </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How have you to your other project Mother Love cuts ? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I believe that we have very good song written and to the beginning , it was great . </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band for three years , until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) had never issued a record . </seg>
<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed , for so long , and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (TD), with us were the collar; friends when I hear a song or see photos , I think , what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , to laugh together and on music and football and many other issues . </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was an extraordinary person and we miss him . </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica . </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that it knows its work , especially Eddie Vedder , and the band for the opening selected ? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes , the production sent us videos of several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer , which will be exciting . </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why change the text by Yellow Ledbetter always , if you live others-plays ? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This is a question for Vedder Ed (Eddie), I have no idea . </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it , and I believe that he is the first thing he chooses . </seg>
<seg id="2101"> By whom President; influenced you as Bassist ? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Of so many + </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The first to come up with me , Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many that I could talk about the Bassisten , which I liked , all afternoon . </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has it Pearl jam , the way to keep alive , even though it is no longer a fad ? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word for . </seg>
<seg id="2107"> If I think about it , I can think of the band , which I have mentioned previously , for example , Mudhoney Sound Guards , nirvana and all the others who were at the same time , if they are still important , I think the great , because it is interesting to hear the music and band as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before . </seg>
<seg id="2108"> Initially was their music dark , now it is positive . </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why ? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting , because I believe that there are a few songs on the new album , which could be something lightly , but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe deemed to be a very dark song , although they also have a good thing in itself . </seg>
<seg id="2111"> To two of the tears when I heard it played as Ed . It is very dark song . </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that if you are older and is something drastic in your life - for example , if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced the your artistic creation and your music and these two songs are the clear for me . </seg>
<seg id="2113"> However , I also believe that we can make a happier person and still dark music . </seg>

<seg id="2189"> The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona . </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid 1980 s , the peak of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola . </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure , den Berg described as a massive city park in Barcelona . </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was even in figures; compared with the Central Park in New York . </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the sinking of the CMB in 1987 , the park in the eyes of many of the ceiling of Barcelona , because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction , but upwards (mountains) and (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification Collserolas as park plays with this idea . </seg>
<seg id="2195"> As a model was no longer the Central Park , but yellowbox Stone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibärs . </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far it was , as the city in September a huge Tendering , consisting of 16 competitions , spend for further access to Collserola gates . </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Undoubtedly , a gateway to the concept of a parks . </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either this is the case , or somebody has to put doors in the country . </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question arises of themselves: Collserola , park or mountain ? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The announcement is not only from organizational power , but also in a reflection on the city about the discussion of all architects from Barcelona . </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a rekurrentes issue to the two members of the old eingesessenen caste , who meet in the lift , can use . </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Think about it , and this fact offers the stuff of one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona , and some university professors who have applied to the project . </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán , Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate . </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán &quot; it is necessary , &quot; after the attack on the coast on the &quot; front &quot; in the mountains , the discourse of Ildefons Cerda , on the green apples , has been held . </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot; It should be based on the principle that mainly largest Park is the beach . </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things , because it is easily accessible . </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex , &quot; is the architect , for whom the title &quot; doors of Collserola &quot; an &quot; impressive &quot; is: we must not &quot; as access to a park , but as a limit of areas where we need to act . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol , as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience , viewed the proposal as a &quot; intellectual challenge &quot; that &quot; some risks &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risks from the &quot; uncertainty , which brings with it the creation of a public space today &quot; from the 1980 s , after the experience in the field of the forum had their &apos; swan song &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the limit to what can be developed . </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot; Contain something always means to determine the next step &quot; to go beyond that . </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot; We need to think about new urban planning instruments , because the current [ in response to the bluebrint General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol , which is close to the issue , simplified , the side of Collserola , in the sense of Valle Ana , &quot; can be understood as a Park , not the direction in Barcelona &apos; , and for Judenstaatrein involved . </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol , pointed out that there is already a study by the patronage-based de Collserola , which should not &quot; fall on deaf ears , &quot; even though he was grateful to the City Council that it has given his body the way , &quot; &quot; from the first to participate in this project . </seg>
<seg id="2215"> He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief , which allows the architects , to participate in the debate , although its &quot; doubt &quot; to say whether this technical profile the Multi-disciplinary teams (&quot; exactly the right thing , &quot; he says), &apos; We architects should only be a tool . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex , because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: &apos; 16 competitions were advertised in the sample , &quot; he says , &quot; on the Gebirge-Meer axis . But there is no Längsschnittperspektive , the area in its entirety . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has led at least in his case that he is participating in the 16 competitions . </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise would clash the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors . </seg>
<seg id="2219"> His opinion , the city should absolutely guarantee that the swath directly on the whole length of the Ronda de Dalt is so that a soft transition between city and belt . </seg>

<seg id="2225"> After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to the Casa de Barrio Antiguo Arraigo 1 in the capital . </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In this place he was 49 days after a second arrest warrant , the officials of the Ministerio Público had rejected the offences of corruption and organised crime . </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19 October , he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta because he is supposedly the owner of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos had bribed . , however , it was just a few hours in the Mittelsicherheitstrakt , since death threats against him . </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of urban prison in San Nicolás de los Garza . </seg>

<seg id="2238"> At a press conference mentioned Dionisio Pérez Jácome , secretary for communications and transport , that would have confirmed the pilot before the start , the weather conditions were suitable for the flight . </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot; The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres of contact with trees , and lost the helicopter the rump , seems to indicate that the helicopters had several contacts soil . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 , which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff . </seg>
<seg id="2241"> He also said that in the investigations in the area , the machine on the decrepit , was not Hubschrauberteile were found . </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot; In the search , no aircraft parts found in other places , the surcharge was the whole structure . </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The helicopter was built for 19 , which is why he met all the requirements for the passengers . </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees . </seg>
<seg id="2245"> Now it is a priority , the results as soon as possible , but this could take several months , perhaps even a year . </seg>
<seg id="2246"> , for its part , assured Gilberto López Meyer , Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and services in Mexico), that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit flown and the plane fell to a soft Abhang . </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot; This information strengthens the assumption that it was taken at the time of impact to a normal Flugoperation . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference , the head of the SCT , Pérez Jácome , six relevant points which , in the investigation should be taken into account: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In line with the standards was a flight to the rules of the flight , which means that should have had the team during the flight and on the ground is sufficient . </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The AICM , appropriate weather conditions at the start . Forth--that during the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexiko-Staat went on some deep some clouds . </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Elected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is possible that selected the team because of the clouds a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca-Tal . </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Impact of: </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The impact of the latest radar and recording of the helicopter agree . Perhaps there has been before the impact of a loss on the plane , a deviation from the air route . </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Were the remains of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The until now this information indicates that the helicopters from ascending and seitlicher direction aufgeprallt was . </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of the plane scattered remains suggest that was aufgeprallt the helicopter with its intact structure on the ground . </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No evidence of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The remains of the aircraft at the scene of an accident at either fire may suggest explosion . </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The last results point to several Bodenkontakte . </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In the investigations on the ground aircraft spare parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level . Abschüssig and is showing Schrägung of seven to  degrees . </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the sequence , in which the helicopters is likely to break . </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Some information suggests that could have had the helicopters several ground contacts . </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a minuziösen search in an area that is beyond the wake at the scene of an accident railroad-bridge , could not be found commutes aircraft spare parts , which the adoption bio-fortified that caring for Flugzeugstruktur against the soil . </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS is a research protocol to the finding of the gene for obesity . </seg>
<seg id="2268"> They Social Security Institution Mexico &apos;s , a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people , which is supported by IPN . </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexicano Instituto del Seguro Social - IMSS social security fund (Mexico) announced that a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title &quot; genetics of obesity in childhood and youth &quot; is to be found the genetic markers associated with obesity . </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz López , the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for medical research , focus biochemistry) to the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that one team , consisting of doctors , improve , Ernährungsspezialisten and social workers . </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) Politécnico del Instituto Nacional (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The population is invited to take part in the study , interested parties can come to sports of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico , where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests with children and young people . </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation at the sports Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) started and since 8 October at the sports Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue . </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If that is the target of 500 to 600 inquiry; people , the study on the football field of Independencia (in the south of the main city of) and on the Morelos (in the north of the main city of). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He said that the aim of the study had knowledge of other factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases . </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the global day of diabetes , it will come to an end , he said that  children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years with the consent; and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires . </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You will also raised questions about their physical activity and their family disease in history to risk factors that could have diabetes or renal insufficiency , to control . </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He took it from that (measured by the aforementioned Saturdays the Untersuchungspersonen weight , size , Taillenumfang), their blood pressure controlled and Blutwerte as the Glukosespiegel , Triglyceride , Cholesterol , insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity) would be destined . </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz said López , this would take place at the concerns of health staff on the alarming increase in weight of young people . </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot; By the health surveys from 1999 and 2006 that have increased in less than six years , the proportion of obese young at 77 per cent and the girls with obesity at 47 percent , and the obesity has increased dramatically , &quot; said the specialist of the IMSS . </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He stated that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the population in Mexico with that of other peoples unterschiede . </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He was that on average , a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65 per cent to 30 per cent of European and indianisch-amerikanischer , to 5 per cent of African origin , which is in the genes , which are associated with diabetes and obesity , &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2283"> In general , he said the genetics of obesity emotion-related in the inability of the surplus to us energy (calories) to burn out , so that will be stored in this form of fat . </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers , the direct benefit of the study participants were in a comprehensive study of children , which would , if this were a degree of obesity or obesity . </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It would even the presence Hautfalten dark in the neck and Innenarm (Akanthosis), the point to the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage , investigated . </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All the information would be treated as confidential and informed the parents in writing by the doctors and the doctors say the parents all measurements and propose them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases . </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors , which are responsible for being overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases , lack of exercise , which means lack of movement in everyday life , most of the time of the day in front of the television to and to use means of transport , rather than short ways to to go . </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high caloric intake , meaning that an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and analysis (Tamales , bread , pizza , hamburgers , etc .), together with a high fat and protein and genetics , which is to be analysed in this research project . </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt by the UNAM prevent potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera , researchers at the School of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM with Polymeren modified Asphalte , in order to make the mixture more resistant to weather and temperature changes </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Would the signs that are based on the road surface , respected , it would not be necessary to fix almost 200 000 potholes , if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera , researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM , and gave warning that if this were to happen and laying the maintenance of the Asphaltbelags , reduced the number of potholes , or even be avoided completely . </seg>
<seg id="2292"> &quot; Bumps &quot; from a technical point of view , in his speech he gave at the International Year of Chemistry , he knows that the laboratory , for which he is responsible , with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing , however , in order to establish a the asphalt similar mix , the greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures . </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera said Nájera that this type Asphalte modified in areas with extremely hot climate , such as in some cities in the north of the country , should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of the holes . </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon link , which is part of a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other a low - the so-called Malthene . Together; give them the road surface be typical zähelastisches behaviour . </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C as a liquid , at 120 ° C , it is very liquid , and in 50 ° C , while he is in very low temperatures fragile . </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot; That means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the roads is not uniform , but on a day depending on the weather and temperature changes change &apos; , the engineer . </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researchers said the FQ , the streets of Mexico City have majority a flexible road surface which , together , from six material; classes , which included the last three asphalt . </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the top classes is a abrasion-proof layer of asphalt , from the small , in gebadeten asphalt and then entrenched stones . </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Every single piece this decay , had been bathed in asphalt . </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles to travel and produced forces , this class a good forces; distribution in the road surface . </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot; If it were modified asphalt , would distribute the forces , even better , &quot; said the chemical engineer . </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &quot; On the Verschleißschicht &quot; , he tells us , &quot; will be a final layer , the so-called Tragschicht , interpreted the from tiny stones , that is , from sand , which has also been in asphalt sweating . </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Because they are class in contact with the car tyres , they need a greater force than the mechanical abrasion-proof class and they must produce friction . </seg>
<seg id="2304"> The this road receives the most forces and distributed , the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is , must be maintained . </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather conditions , including humidity and temperature fluctuations , are more important to take into account factors , above all , the water , &quot; he said , &quot; because it affects the behaviour of the abrasion-proof class . </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the site is a wet , water in the class and is only difficult; back; that caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and as a result , the incidence of stroke . </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If a pothole , &quot; he said , &quot; will make the Titanic-Maru class , while the abrasion-proof class then , but the damage is not immediately , but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs of proper maintenance programmes . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores national research system (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the presence of the holes , so must the thickness of each class of the surface and in relation to the vehicle , and it must be ensured that is respected in order to prevent frequent blow holes this arrangement . </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research at this stage , for example , about Asphaltemulsionen , which in other countries are already on the market , and with which the bumps repair clueless.Despite simply and without high temperatures . </seg>

<seg id="2313"> Once again Valle del Cauca empty for the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia . </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time had to be Melina Ramírez Serna content to be on the winners podium , a silver crown and the bond that they , as a new disproportions Colombia to make . </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With this the night they result in Cartagena , where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar , the &apos;s Department at 14 disproportions title and Melina on the legion of women from Cauca del Valle , who had kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed . Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leïla Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question that there are many today is: What was missing ? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result is the demise of a big favorite , which had shown in every showing that they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia . Not for nothing that she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor at Jolie of Vogue , title , which had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro , and took the crown of Miss Colombia with home . </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor that is seen as crucial for the jury &apos;s decision to appoint them to the first Miss , is that it has the answer to the question &quot; what book you most and why ? &apos; , which affects their of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria had Leamos , was not convinced . </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied the author: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot; I read a lot , I think quite to the literature , I believe , it is a kind of ended , ultimately , I believe that the book , for my childhood most era--was , &apos; the small Prince &apos; is a very deep book . </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the moment I read &apos; guilt and atonement . &quot; It is a book of universal culture that we should read all I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a wonderful book , &apos; passions &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that was , firstly because of the term &apos; more civilised , &apos; and , secondly , because they had not declared , in what way each proposed book they had influenced . </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result , &quot; The universe is wise , it happens , what needs to be done . </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all people: read a bit &apos; The small Prince &apos; and it is a great book . </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things , it is said that Nováky is the favorite of El Valle . </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the measures , which are all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to get all the prices had (Gastronomie-Wettbewerb Oster , Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), &quot; made the other candidates jealous , what the Queen stresste , which could therefore not shine on the stage . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And the said in her first speech to the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony . </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although I am sure you in two , it lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico to window-dressing; . </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the programme &quot; Como en casa &quot; in the channel RCN , said that the fact that Melina been crowned Miss , &quot; shows that the candidate , wins the most prices during the competition , will not ultimately Queen . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Was also Valle at the end of the press from the road - a mistake . </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Is a further hypothesis that could not convince the Valle Jurie on their interest in social work , which is the essence of the National beauty competition . </seg>
<seg id="2332"> There must be a reason that , two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty , they were a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country . </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot; Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia . We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social feeling , that she had already worked on projects from participation in the competition , &quot; she said . </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is speculation that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and fibrosis , which said it in the stomach area , had sinned , but it is inconsistent , because the jury , as a candidate for &apos; natural beauty , with a healthy body , good eating habits and good physical work . </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of the queens , Jorge Hernán Orozco , admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better , &quot; but their problem with the fibrosis belly , which was difficult for me to be honest to say , put their marks on the last day . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> , meanwhile , is the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos that of the woman from defects; Valle del Cauca are the surgical intervention , which they have been . </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot; The operations are OK , but Valle did not know how they do it right . </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Their body is never their strong side , and this job; they had to pay . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this prize , which assesses the first time by the National beauty contest , emerged after the appearance in a cruel to forecast the in the night should be true , it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize , if they are not allowed to come in tax-neutrality crown . </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Whether this is true or not , the fact is that the inaugural Melina today the rule , not the Queen , but as a Princess , a position that it offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National Colombia; beauty competition in one of the international competitions . </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However , it will be as one of the queens , escaped the despite their overwhelming speech for Cartagena the crown was , in the history books . </seg>
<seg id="2342"> It was the work of the doctor , the body of Alfonso Cano identified </seg>
<seg id="2343"> I--a Lophoskopist from Cali went as the man who &quot; Alfonso Cano &quot; identified in history . </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials plays a key role . </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On 4 November was a Lophoskopist last of the fraud investigation unit of the prosecutor &apos;s office (CTI) from Cali as the man who the identity of the head of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: &quot; Alfonso Cano &quot; by comparison of fingerprints . </seg>

<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career González worked in communities of Chocó , where he had to go often five days in the jungle , in order to achieve the place , in which the bodies that were he should identify . </seg>
<seg id="2348"> 2000 siedelte Valle on and after the completion of the necessary courses he is on Lophoskopie , that is the investigation into the skin , the friction , that is , the pieces of baggage and Fußflächen exposed . </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week of the use of the so-called Alfonso Cano pointed out Eliazar put clothes for at least three days . </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Nothing much awaited him . </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he flew in helicopters from Palmira after Cauca . </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he had to identify two bodies , and that there was a suspicion that the of the man , who had led the world &apos;s oldest guerrillas could be , so he should be the Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> When he reached , but with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was , he could not identify him because of his physical appearance , because this was the pictures , which he had seen in the media , not in the slightest . </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had a beard , was dressed as a pawn of the area , no glasses and was very much thinner . </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don &apos;t lie . </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifying glass , ink , a Pflanzkelle pockets and a lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the Abdruckblatt . </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He had seen right: it was &quot; Alfonso Cano . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Was still the same night this man from Puerto Tejada responsible for the Defence Minister , Juan Carlos Pinzón , to say that it was in fact the leader of the FARC . </seg>

<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen of Sijín in Cali was the acknowledgment that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against &apos; Cano &apos; , very important . </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people know our work is not . </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate , which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a crime . </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten not only identify bodies , they also support investigations in murder and robbery , and confirm the identity of the person arrested . </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they were arrested many criminals wrong before or they have no identity papers . </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take the fingerprints from them and look them in the database . </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researchers told us that he had to in a theft a piece of wall from a House grab; , because the thief had it is at this point with his hand aufgestützt , as he is a fully gestopften safe herauszog with jewellery and money . </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &apos; walls are difficult , because their surface for fingerprinting; inappropriate , but in this case we have the imprint of the whole and the criminals , who had participated in several , identify , &quot; he recalled . </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The fingerprints can be relieved or even murder suspects . </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently was found surrounded one death of spirits bottles . </seg>
<seg id="2370"> In the investigation that could be a family member who was thought , and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle . </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although not guaranteed that it is the murderer , but he is with the place where the crime was committed , in context . </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist CTI declared that &quot; the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were excluded from the object . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If it appears , is used for carrying a Pflanzkelle or a bond . </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Then the prints to Asif sent , that is the criminal database , or to Personenstandamt . </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot; The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented , &quot; the expert told the CTI . </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He said , not everything is as it would in the TV series SCI outlined; . </seg>
<seg id="2377"> So as not all the gold is , what is , that is not everything that touches turns , a fingerprint . </seg>

<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators pushed in tents on the Zuccotti-Platz together . </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A large part came after the evacuation order and changed its location in a nearby park . </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street in this Tuesday called for the authorities New York , when it with a court order once again tried to enter the Manhatten-Platz , after they were in the early hours of the morning by the place has been removed and had tried to occupy a different place in the Big Apple . </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators pushed up before the Zuccotti-Platz to which they themselves with a court order , the &quot; outraged &quot; is the new tents at this point , to provide access . Meanwhile , another part of the movement of the evacuation orders and occupied a parking further north in the city , where there were nine arrests . </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot; Our idea is that , if the court does not allow us to campen on the place , we are in a different place and the battle with legal means to continue the return to the &apos;s Zuccotti , through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations , &quot; said Mark Bray , a spokesman for the movement &quot; Ocupy Wall Street . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray said that the response of the &quot; outraged &quot; at the evacuation of their tent camp , which directly by Michael Bloomberg , had been ordered the Mayor of New York , came to court where the judge who Lucy Billings an order the forced evacuation of the place , and the demonstrators , the tents . </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Also occupied the &quot; outraged &quot; a new park , which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entry in the Holland-Tunnel , which connects New York and New Jersey , and is the property of the Trinity Church . </seg>
<seg id="2387"> They could fill the place at least an hour , but after that , the police and arrested some of the demonstrators , although Bray can be no precise figures , he told the news agency Efe that he saw including several journalists with handcuffs . </seg>

<seg id="2391"> The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street in place and the use of &quot; laws , which were adopted after the occupation and that the protesters with their tents and other things that they had used before , in the park . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg is , in the press clearly , due to this court warrant the re-opening of the place in public and the demonstrators had been lifted , the demonstrators , he has indicated that the Stadtgesetze did not allow them to return to set up tents and Schlafsäcken in this place . </seg>

<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg said that he had given the order to clearing of the square , because this &quot; was turned into a place where , not the people protesting , but to break the law and in some cases , in order to harm other people , &quot; because &quot; some shops have received threats &apos; worry and the residents &apos; to their quality of life . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot; The evacuation in the dawn was loathsome and shows that Bloomberg , in fact , in protecting the interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers , &quot; added the spokesman for the movement , the mayor anschuldigte &quot; to respect the freedom of the press . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The leaders of &quot; Occupy Wall Street &quot; informed that they thought , &quot; Great actions &quot; to organise for Thursday , together with local organisations and trade unions , the two months ago , the last protests since 17 September now to remember . </seg>

<seg id="2405"> Japan is being reborn after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP is growing at 1,5% thanks to the domestic consumption and the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the last March , the Japanese economy paralyzed , which are still in the recovery following the devastating earthquake , which in a nuclear crisis einmündete , and the worst catastrophe that Japan is the 2 th World War had witnessed . </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo rated the material damage to $ 300 000 , a blow , despite the difficult global economy , it seems . </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three quarters of the case , the details of the gross domestic product from July to September , finally to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% on the year hochgerechnete quota . </seg>
<seg id="2410"> In the second quarter of measured value; in Japan begins the financial year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010 . </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery can be explained in part by the machinery sales for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas . </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Actually increased the company &apos;s investment of 1,1% compared to the fall of 0,9% for investments , which were recorded from January to March , the first decline in after six months of relentless increases . </seg>
<seg id="2413"> , however , is the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not exclusively from Keynesian aligned yourself , using the crisis to build infrastructure and build new ones . </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Is woken up Japan in particular thanks to the development of the domestic consumption , which accounts for 60% of Japan &apos;s GDP . </seg>
<seg id="2415"> These variable rose by 1% , driven by the increased spending for vehicles , travel and leisure activities . </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the Yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market , after the yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the &quot; refuge currencies; &quot; of investors , who are fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the dire predictions for the U.S.A. , a privilege , it is like a tombstone in the accounts of the exporting companies . </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With more currency are the products more expensive abroad , a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology companies . </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota and Sony , for example , led their weak profits from July to September on the listing of the yen . </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue to ultraperipheral EU countries under siege , the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda . </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot; We must be very careful to the the1930 risks , for example , the deterioration in certain foreign economies , the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , &quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy , Motohisa Furukawa . </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The prospects are really not very aufheiternd . </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states in September clearer signs of a slowdown in the economic development would have actually been . </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator , ahead of the turning points of the world economy , brought to light , that would be drawn to the greatest economic potential the brakes . </seg>

<seg id="2427"> Athens is again doubt </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos says that the austerity measures are adopted , but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the risk premiums in the amount securitarian of the peripheral countries and to define uncertainty early Greece further into the labyrinth that leads to the great European debt crisis . </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The impression that the &quot; consensus &quot; of the new Greek interim government rather than a reaction to the pressure from Brussels is as a real conviction of the political forces , is slowly by the facts . </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister , Lukas Papadimos , pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the in his appointment agreed are hundreds days may be too short for their implementation , the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia , Antonis Samaras , the new austerity measures and not his call new elections on the planned date of 19 February , will withdraw . </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot; The most important task this government is the implementation of the decisions that were made at the summit on 26 October , &quot; assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate , the tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak . </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programmes to promote employment , to reform the law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives . </seg>
<seg id="2434"> It does not remove Samaras communication the doubts about his attitude: &apos; We have our commitment to support the transitional government , but to do nothing . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservative leaders was a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF , the body; , of which 8000 million , the Athens urgently needs , entsperren , and he made it clear that there are no commitment on the fulfilment of the austerity measures would approve . </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission , which is irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum , confirmed yesterday , at their request is to not: the economic aid would not signed , if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties &apos; not a clear written agreement as soon as possible &quot; to sign . </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , Altafaj Altafaj , said that the inspectors from the troika &quot; very soon &quot; to Athens were returning to discuss with the new government , &quot; which for the payment of the sixth tranche &quot; to the tune of 8000 million euros quot; is needed , &quot; although there is still no final date . </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek knot has for a while . </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Queen Sofía: &quot; these are tools for progress and hope &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen has stressed the &quot; dominant &quot; position of Spain in relation to these type </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain has a dominant position in the role of the world &apos;s Kleinstfinanzierungen &quot; achieved . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain in the last two decades , the world &apos;s second donors had developed for this means of international cooperation , the &quot; essence &quot; is based on the fact that it is a &quot; instrument for social progress , justice and the hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredits yesterday in Valladolid . It was convinced that there are &quot; no doubts &quot; about the fact that these kind of deals would be &quot; absolutely essential &quot; to the set by the United Nations until 2015 Jahrtausendziele &quot; and in particular the aim , the number of employees , with incomes of less than a dollar a day , leading to live below the poverty line . &quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot; is also working to &quot; to the extension of the beneficiaries network; &quot; until the last corner of the world and it is through this responsibly , &quot; said the Queen Sofia , the hopes that the initiatives and contributions by the summit , which will continue until Thursday , will be , &quot; the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and particularly for women &quot; are guaranteed as the main beneficiaries of these loans . </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot; We have seen many successes &apos; and &apos; face many challenges . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The summit on Microcredits is not only a forum for debate , but also a platform to jump-start &quot; two fundamental objectives . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Said the Queen , it will aim to have until the end of the 2015 175 million poor families access to these services and that will be ten million of these households the poverty line . </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The concept of the Microcredits is in Spain and the rest of the world to the Muhammad Yunus &apos; years ago started way &quot; that the Queen Sofia as an &quot; act of justice and recognition &quot; assessed . </seg>
<seg id="2449"> The father of this financing instrument described it as a &quot; admirable idealists who have committed to the fight against poverty &quot; and whose work they know for 15 years , as was the Queen after Bangladesh to learn about the loans strategy on the ground . </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed by a year later , the first world summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 . Quot; have all we have seen a steady development , &quot; said the Queen , whose commitment to this project , yesterday the assessment as &quot; head of families &apos; in &apos; and &apos; advocate of the poor &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally ended the Queen Sofia her speech , by the people to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty Musikblock . </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot; Ethical imperative &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity &apos; is an ethical imperative &quot; for the entire democratic state . </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In that sense , they pointed out that it is a mistake , to tie the development assistance in times of economic boom , because it was a &quot; lasting commitment . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Falls victim to Jiménez was of the opinion that the Microcredits a &quot; serious and rigorous policy is for the eradication of poverty , &quot; and that the governments of the industrialized countries &apos; now more than ever , &quot; according to solidarity-conscious criteria needed to work , and not to allow the solidarity of the crisis . </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain are the Microcredits one of the &quot; most forms of development aid . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for International Cooperation , Soraya Rodríguez , applauded &quot; the success &quot; , &quot; marginalised &quot; people , &apos; which are always closed doors &apos; to &apos; hope &apos; and the mayor of Valladolid , Francisco Javier León de la Riva , saying the session; welcome in a city , the &quot; &quot; opened their doors , contaminated by the spirit of solidarity . </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU is proposing to elect the EU president with the advent of vote </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday , 14 November in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel , Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party , without any real difficulties . </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally intended in the programme , but has prevailed in the autumn , in particular those activists enough to do that , the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax . </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The proposed by the Bureau Presidencies request from the European Commission has approved almost unanimously . </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Less than 1001 delegates voted only nine , ten had abstained from the vote . </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Several minutes of standing ovation , which were due to the Interventionserlässen first Angela Merkel and a few hours later , Wolfgang Schäuble , lieen from the three ec-syria tended to finance ministers no doubt . </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The idea of the Chancellor - as well as the application - slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot; not less , but more Europe . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not simply because Europe means peace , but also because &quot; nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor is &quot; the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could be through the control of the European Union reinforcing altering of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of the budget of the countries in the euro area could be expressed , as well as this , however , in the election of the president of the European Commission on the basis of general vote , &quot; in order to give Europe a face . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> However , this is certainly one of the proposals for a resolution approved by Congress , which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble . </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly , it is unlikely that the 47 agree quickly to this revolution: Groβ-Britannien is is the thing; hostile , and the chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion . </seg>
<seg id="2470"> However , the milestone is . </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Also rejected the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of any country in the Executive Board of the weighting of the individual economies , which would seem a more powerful position of Germany . </seg>
<seg id="2472"> The way the climate within their party safe--by Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl , who has not , however , its Congress at the expense of the &quot; small &quot; or to win in difficulties European countries , which would criticise the arrogant Germany . </seg>
<seg id="2473"> As far as of the request of the importance of the Franco-German friendship &quot; is a paragraph , not Angela Merkel France on the plan . </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not directly . </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Because it reminded that was Leipzig two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle . </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact , one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army . </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What represents the fraud in sick; reports ? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the family allowances UMP and government now the turnover in attack . </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday , 15 November in Bordeaux , to go to a family car--something aid and a speech on the - since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against fraud and to social economic dependence on the state . </seg>
<seg id="2480"> To accompany this attack , which is based on the desire to make the economy in a tough test , is not on the other hand , a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign , wants to focus the majority of workers ill . </seg>
<seg id="2481"> With the economic objectives: the government seeking to the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick , with workers in the private sector . </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In plain terms , that means that a sick workers without approval of specific company would lose the wages of four days , so at least 15% of its monthly income . </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A Manahme which , according to the newspaper &quot; Les echoes &quot; threatens to anger , would help , however , to EUR 280 million . </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And the other with a Manahme rather symbolic in nature: give the state officials a unvergüteten Karenztag in disease case (so far are there for them , in the Gegensatze on the three Karenztagen in the private sector , no Karenzfrist). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues in the debate , the majority also anew the issue of fraud , but this time on the associated with Arbeitsabsenz abuse that are targeted . </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &apos; controls will be much more important , and in addition , this rückzuvergüten , if requested , &quot; warned Betrand Xavier on Sunday , 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL . </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases , the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent activity in the areas of ill , a little unproportioniert . </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is in fact already been the subject of permanent observation and political offensive operations , the most ever since 2002 have borne fruit . </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not more ill more frequently than people elsewhere in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="2490"> But first we dwell in the national figures . </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the country , car--something CNAM were paid out in 2006 more than EUR 237 million days buy-offs . </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Gemä of economic research and documentation Institute of health care are the days buy-offs in 2008 with 11,3 billion 5% of health spending . </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount of 46% on maternity leave and work accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube , expressed the EUR 6,2 billion . </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And therefore 2,5% health expenses . </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010 , given the French to the 17,8 days in 2009 , according to a study by the Alma Consulting group on average only 14,5 sick days . </seg>
<seg id="2496"> Midway , of certain differences covered up: a different , in 2007 Monster.com , website for career development , was published , showed that 75 of the 40 th 000 , French workers said to have taken a single Krankentag . </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another , this time from the health insurance buoyancy; study makes it clear that were 37% of the sick; reports in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days , 22% between 8 and 14 days , between 15 and 15 days a month , 15% between one and three months and 11% . </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared to their European neighbours , the French workers not to incapacity benefit more than elsewhere . </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One in 2010 of two researchers of the French state , Centre for science research (CNRS), the long-term study that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (because of disease or otherwise) oszillierte , in France between 10 and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark , 15 in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands . </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud in sick; reports is a very small proportion of the black economy . </seg>
<seg id="2501"> On the fraud will be achieved only a weak Ausma . </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there is systmatische controls on sick; reports that exceed 45 days . </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008 , the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1,5 million checks that 13 of the 285.000 of the past , short-term ill , the expressed in 37.050 cases , &quot; unjustified or too long . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="2519"> Euthanasia and physician-assisted Freitod must be legalised , a panel of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live in denial of death , as stated in the report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The body , said that governments , institutions of the health care , and doctors did on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death . </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians are a really out to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose . </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an excellent report by the Royal Society of Canada , were involved in the six experts , the different subject areas , including ethics , justice and medicine--a are linked . </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This body , the Government to amend the penal code so in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia , where this election , and for patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision . </seg>
<seg id="2526"> As a prelude to the experts a recent poll by the independent EIU society , which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the Erdballes . </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although has placed in Canada at the 10 th , the study noted that &quot; has produced the death medical care in Canada a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medical care or not:77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers , tell us the of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts . </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the desire of the overwhelming majority of Canadians , to die at home , so die , however , 68,6% of these in the hospital . </seg>
<seg id="2530"> The whole country is considered the rate with 86% in hospital deaths in Quebec . </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In the sensitive issue on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide are the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government , which has already geäuert , no changes to the law on euthanasia and want to begleitetem suicide , are against . </seg>
<seg id="2532"> But now there is according to the experts , the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected; , whose approach legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or drug use , we have no proof that such a non-criminalisation Miβbräuche in their application , so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting persons would entail . </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Quite the reverse you encounter much more cases such breaches in the countries in which are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , as yesterday Jocelyn Downie , a co-signatory of the report , in a teleconference . </seg>

<seg id="2536"> Canadians support the euthanasia </seg>

<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that do not have the issue of legalisation of euthanasia , to convey the message that besäe the lives of older or disabled people less value . </seg>
<seg id="2539"> In terms of the people who already have implemented a assisted suicide , the respondents to 41% are of the opinion that this should not be prosecuted . </seg>
<seg id="2540"> As far as maintenance or the resources to patients , the situation is less clear , the authors of the report . </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Similarly this in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis should be close to that in the penal code tunnel; , that the possibility of the funds , for the legal rejection , there have been not as criminal should apply . </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The panel of experts , that should be trained health care professionals in the task to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life , and this without fear of prosecution . </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The body , said that governments , institutions , health care and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Least , calls on the body where already wide-ranging in the Canadian institutions to health care means used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen , at least to consider it , because these little as well as the euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and they relate to the same procedures spawned . </seg>

<seg id="2549"> RA Deschamps also stresses , the author of the report seemed to put the responsibility of the individual above all others who are involved in the social upholstery of society . </seg>
<seg id="2550"> But now , he says , there would be &quot; guidelines and obligations in a society . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> Margaret Somerville , expert on health law , also has a &quot; strong opposition &quot; to the conclusions of the report , which they described as &quot; Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest &apos; . </seg>

<seg id="2660"> Was the European currency worth 1,3570 dollar which about 10 p.m. , so it was at 0,4% . </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to the traders has fallen , after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel , who had gathered on Monday in Congress , had granted a request , which includes the possibility of a troubled countries to leave the euro zone , without having to leave the European Union . </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit . </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Italy and Spain are still at a very worrying level lending spreads . </seg>
<seg id="2664"> This Tuesday morning , the yield on Italian bonds at 10 years 6,85% , the Spanish title established on 6,2% . </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions of the interest rates in the southern countries , but also in France , are still the fears of investors . </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The future Italian leader Mario Monti called for by the markets more time to question the threatened by paralysis due to the debt situation in Italy . </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had , in turn , confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the starting on 27 October summit of eurozone are &quot; the main task &quot; of his government . </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is in the Visir of the markets , and on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country . </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The Zinsschere (&quot; spread &quot;) between the German and Spanish 10 -Jahres-Obligationen has once again achieved a new all-time high . </seg>
<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of eurozone growth figures </seg>
<seg id="2671"> Statistically , France had a budget by the consumption; supported economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter , ergodynamic a little better than the expected 0,3 . </seg>
<seg id="2672"> Had the statistical Federal Office INSEE the market downturn , however , the figures for the second quarter , revised and a deficit of 0,1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a Stagno-Europe . </seg>
<seg id="2673"> In truth , it is the fourth quarter , the economists concerns me the most . </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany had , for its part , for the same period there has been a growth of 0,5% . </seg>
<seg id="2675"> An initial projection of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 p.m. , with the European Commission warns against the risk of a double-dip recession . </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts should win against dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> There is a matter that is not on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions , so this is certainly the energy policy . </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and cost of electricity matter--to in direct Mae purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company . </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to take a Wahltreffen for a reason , to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy . </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only bear fruit if it the whole economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed explored options . </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French should their opinion on objective facts , quantum leap rational data . </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although there are 7 billion people on the planet , the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by making 2050 , must not give up a huge share of the world &apos;s population in a vital element . </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time , it must be the scarcity of fossil resources , in order to be able to continue to produce residuarity electricity , without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , a lost from the environmental debate issue , to forget , to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten . </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters . </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore blebt Germany continue to isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power . </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case in Belgium , which is the decision of the need to find a replacement objectives--before replacement source , in Switzerland , which is just to build more nuclear power plants in the last generation . </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Groβbritannien , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India and Brazil , to name just a few states , pursue their projects continue to unenthusiastic; with determination . </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States have decided , after Fukushima , its Park another , using the following the nuclear accident Sidmar Three Mile Island once again go into operation . </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Even if the focused on renewable energy sources , German model occasionally as an example , that is , however , the reality the discourse . </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of the means , one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence in particular of Russia , an increase in the gas and coal plants CO2 emissions . </seg>
<seg id="2692"> The whole of this unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months to come . </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Denmark is a cause for thought the case . </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is European tables leader in wind energy , from which it takes 30% of its electricity , but the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas , used it with wind energy; because of his CO2-Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average . </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French budgets by 40% higher electricity bills . </seg>
<seg id="2696"> As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key role of the competitiveness and the stability of the industry at national soil , the French electricity companies because of the best in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy , what the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to liesse illusion . </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Polls showed that the price is , the very broad majority of French people , as well as little is willing to pay , they resistance against the principle of this energy source . </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remind ourselves that our country &apos;s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs . </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings them a whole lot of specialised small and medium-sized businesses on the international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs . </seg>
<seg id="2701"> France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power , it would put a Groβteil SMEs to victims , and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced . </seg>
<seg id="2702"> The electricians would make a work on sixty years designed EPR , when is the decline of its producers ? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are no more a as a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity . </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The developed by the company Areva , low-carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy of the complementarity of energy sources . </seg>
<seg id="2705"> This is the highest possible level of security for the nuclear power an absolute imperative . </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a safety authority , is the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as the construction in Flamanville . </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Their work teams , who have made a name for their professionalism , are the safety position just had . </seg>
<seg id="2708"> The nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents within 50 years . </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one , and at Three Mile Island , under normal operating conditions has occurred , and so has he been without consequences for people and the environment . </seg>
<seg id="2710"> At Chernobyl was the tragedy of reactor design and unendschuldbares , human error . </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters unprecedented scale , which caused the deaths of several thousand people . </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will learn their lessons , from this accident , as they had done so after the two previous . </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As a result of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants , the EPR a draft , giving him resistance to such phenomena . </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Because it is considered among the Elektrotechnikern as desirable to build a nuclear power station , it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF , liesse by giving them free rein to gut the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development . </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country , but it would be irresponsible , emotion-generating , dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate to dominate , the equally determined economic , social and financial situation of our country . </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is burden--if or opportunity for the economy ? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> , as France has had a change of Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s immigration policy has been criticised for many corners - congestion of police , judicial and administrative bodies of policy on the basis of the figures , reconcilability this policy with the status of a &quot; country of human rights . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently had the against foreign students of official harassment of the weeks , the Interior Minister had it (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France &quot; no talent , have Masonic-style or waiter from abroad needed; . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this policy was analysed rarely from an economic point of view . </seg>
<seg id="2720"> On this issue , there is a wide consensus between right and left . </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Of right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac , 1976 , had declared that &quot; 900.000 people unemployed , including about 2 million immigrant workers , should be not a problem for a country &apos; , of Manicheanism side by Michel Rocard , 1990 , France &quot; could not accommodate all the poverty of the world . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005 on both the right and the left . </seg>
<seg id="2724"> By both camps , the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society . </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the extent of the Grozügigkeit , is to be the immigrants to willing . </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on the banalities , point out , EC-Morocco development would like it , &quot; our migration problems to solve . </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden , as a problem , can possibly have an effect on the elections; however , it is economically costly . </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As we consider the economic experts Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work that combines the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Our World Shaped migration and does Define Our Future , May 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 S.), is among the specialists; a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth , jobs and wages in the immigration; countries . </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The immigration would limit the growth of damage and the labour market situation . </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears of the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that this threat , the local workforce , particularly the less qualified to replace , by exercising pressure on their wages . </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Experience shows , however , that the immigrants in truth complementary are as much as the local wage workers , because they have schwerpunktmäig professions in sectors that are work technically unausgelastet . </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract the local wage workers , the better the immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which is a result of inadequate training the labour supply . </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive wage effect </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Also would have as a surgeon , to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten , does this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation . </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri in this way has calculated that a 1% disabled person rise in flood miteinbezogene , long-term increase in wages between 0,6% and 0,9% herbeiführe . </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the Ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and the economic growth (high proportion naturalized -immigrants under American Nobel laureates; from Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants are also net to the social systems , in European countries , on average , for a total of 1% of the total budget . </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates , for example , that a at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue less spending), of the 150.000 euro . </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate the lack of average points &quot; with the teeth . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These said teeth , which the immigrants should be , achieved just the opposite effect . </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy , it now remains to rethink the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate asset . </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should remind themselves , who , after its invention in Athens; more than two thousand years ago the entire 20 th century on the tragedies of the First World War , the Totalitarianism , the Holocaustes , of the Gulag , but also in Franco &apos;s Spain , Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece on had to endure . </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some thought likely that it will be enough to exercise the right to vote , and to scale possible way , in order to see the democracy once and for all of their enemies win . </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know since Napoleon &quot; the small , &quot; that it was a feature of the state of mind . </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The general election , is the necessary condition of democracy , there is not sufficient condition and can become the &apos; repression &apos; , just as good as s--which it the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it . </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No , democracy requires much more: a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation that separation of powers and control , training , education , economic and social community spirit , a jurisdiction . </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe , in which we find ourselves , is an economic crisis , but it is also very and first and foremost political and European democracy . </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The attitude of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums would have been in this respect , telling character; had twice: once the need for a strong return of the policy , on the other hand , but also those of the troubled sense of their impossibility , their Unangebrachtheit . </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be considered as outdated . </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that have shifted the front lines of the democratic struggle today , and that the Republican soldiers , or at least most of them , are no longer in the right direction . </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain , in order to push for the success of the infra-national referendum , which according to the needs and in or order . </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Does a receive a carte blanche for the European dictator or a leap with their eyes in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the citizens . </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No , we want to Hackebeil , but a collective responsibility , quite rightly , and cross-breeds , an election and democracy , this time at European level . </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal - you know , in fact , not more , where the list - as there is only one crisis , and this is hunger; in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe , which is the dictates of the markets and rating agencies , which is suffering from its impotence and his solidarity . </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe , which is humiliated at international level . </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We are concerned about sovereignty transfers in Europe - it is the whole of Europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and every one of them connected nations . </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is to the sovereignty of the leadership of the European project to give back to the hand . </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is located in the set , whether the Europeans to reduce the burden of debt , by the markets and to enable a future through investments . </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that can be taken without complete democratic Rechtmäigkeit , without us certainly into ruin . </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal was fought by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time about , urges today every European economic governance . </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Agree . </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But this without political integration and greater democracy - as it has in mind - to present to the citizens , would be another foolishness and another prison . </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take on a new stage European construction . </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In the Republic of France to create , it took the fact to Republicans &apos; create . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of the interests; alone was not enough . </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This instruction remains valid . </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must form a better on an economic level integrated Europe . </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be achieved by , you create a politically more democratic Europe , a truly European popular sovereignty . </seg>
<seg id="2771"> We need Europe to create Europe . </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &apos; contact , &quot; smart cards become the common property </seg>

<seg id="2778"> Europe in terms of contactless payment gaining ground , after the region for a long time Asien-Pazifik hinterhergehinkt is . </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa cards are equipped with this functionality , and 75.000 payment terminals accept them . </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France , the modest beginnings: only 400.000 contact , visa cards have been disseminated . </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The consumer markets but steam . </seg>

<seg id="2797"> Paris is about the relationship between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram . </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The relations between the already long under suspicion of the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm . </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday had confirmed the Algerian Vize-Auenminister Abdel Kader Messahel that Algiers; now on &quot; is certainty . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot; The way in which both organisations and the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation , &quot; he told without going into detail . </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to make a similar analysis . </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation on the last January kidnap two Frenchmen in Niger have promoted interfaces . </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In a restaurant in Niamey of members of the Aqmi kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should on successive days at the same time as several their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces have been getöten . </seg>

<seg id="2806"> The analysis of the telephone calls , to several interlocutors in Mali , in Niger and Nigeria are stationed . </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a commissioner; leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri , a city in northern Nigeria , the cradle of Boko Haram had stopped; the other leads to a man who , as the Aqmi and close to the sect applies . </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot; This is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we must wait for clearer evidence before we can talk of a operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot; However , it is conceivable . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot; We know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support of flood and shows that they are increasingly active , &quot; of the Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo . </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In these last few months are these &apos; assistance &apos; has become ever more apparent , just in the speeches and the Operationsmodi of Boko Harem , which is now on the Hinzuziehen of suicide bombers and the use of complex explosives , which bear the same mark as those who have been used by Aqmi . </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community to begin with Washington , has since that time so that they will put pressure on Abuja for the problems caused by Boko Haram . </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Indeed , the Nigerian authorities have the group for a long time as a community of Illuminaten , respectively , of no special attention must be paid . </seg>

<seg id="2822"> The Mohammed Yusuf will be killed in prison that was in captivity . </seg>

<seg id="2833"> If you are listening to the Republican presidential candidates , the voters could almost get that impression . </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For the last few days , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and their fellow-campaigners thundering statements , and their statements on the Auβenpolitik , traditional republikanischem focus , consistently reported . </seg>

<seg id="2866"> And it is already the possibility of the construction of a third pipeline; on themselves route . </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom is the timely and accurate point completion of this huge cornerstone as a victory . </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested . </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany , avoiding any train-path course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine) in the country . </seg>
<seg id="2870"> This is why these two countries will lose some of its power: it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia , by threatening to film the access to European markets . </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw , most involved in the debate , the Nord Stream pipeline was not be avoided , with a &quot; new deutsch-sowietischen pact &quot; in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to compare to the occupation of Poland in 1939 . </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuerst . </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has the support of this enlargement--despite project won an even greater security of supply . </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But at the expense of enfeeblement European energy , because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europe were beaten . </seg>

<seg id="2883"> Auerdem had to be taken more Manahmen for the Protection of fauna and flora . </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The management is a long queue of metal , difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme , which is suspended on the entire length of nothing: either through valves , maintenance stations . </seg>

<seg id="2907"> The 4,5 metres high outlets are the Gasaustrittspforte . </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors are pressure , temperature and other indicators of the gas arriving before transferring this in the German gas pipelines . </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday , this terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour verstreichende supplied . </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate remains of disabled persons to such a high level ? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Is about 19% of people with disabilities to search for a job . </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today is the 15 th week of work for the disabled . &quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a determined public policy , which was introduced in 2005 , is the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice the average average:19% to 9% of the total population problem . </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging ? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot; No , overstated; Civil Blanchet , Director General of the Association Adapt , the &quot; week of work for people with disabilities &quot; . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot; The within fifteen years progress are considerable . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot; When the unemployment rate was not twice , but three times as high . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot; Although there is still an enormous amount of work to do . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said , however , that persist for disabled people unemployed many obstacles remain before they get a job . </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Are also increasingly it is the elderly:37% (17%) on average more than 50 years old . </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level:80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10.000 were disabled persons under the 2,3 million students . </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally , is also the long-term unemployment very widespread:53 in the disability compared to 38% in the average . </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short , there are so many criteria , the Arbeitseinstieg again , and the &quot; heart of the problem , &quot; Christian Grapin , Director-General of Tremplin , a group founded in 1992 , the company is helping disabled workers . </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much for the factual brakes . </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remains the underlying implication that develop , which , of course , but slowly . </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A in April by the Association for the IMS-Entreprendre magazine La Cité study stated , the managers of &quot; a weak level of knowledge about disabled people , &quot; the &quot; over-represented &quot; &quot; of people in wheelchairs , mentally or intellectually less well-off . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to the Anstellungsziel from 6% disabled people , which was in a law of 1987 , to reach . </seg>
<seg id="2952"> This last-mentioned , from 2008 , figures point to a ratios of 2,6% . </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot; We are now in the 3% reported , &quot; Pierre Blanc , Director-General of Agefiph , the organisation , which is charged with recovering , contributions from companies that do not respect the law . </seg>

<seg id="2955"> &quot; The law of 2005 , which increased contributions , created a strong pressure on businesses , said Pierre Blanc . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot; But this improvement is also a real recognition , particularly in the groen firms groups &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Labour , only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 workers--those disabled workers , businesses with 100 to 199 staff in 82 . </seg>

<seg id="2964"> &quot; I would like to look forward , &quot; said the native Liller itself . </seg>
<seg id="2965"> What the contrast between his presentation in the club and Nationalelf &quot; It is a unity that justifies everything . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot; I am in Lille throughout the year , which is not the case in Belgium . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot; It is time for me to go to the start . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Hazard will come after Saint-Denis , reached Friday evening against Romania on the Matchs against France , at last &apos; to shine . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> However , without the note of the &quot; pleasure &quot; to refrain from . </seg>

<seg id="2974"> &quot; We have gone us on the way . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot; To play against them is groes luck ! &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Leekens liess , for its part , with goodwill &quot; pride &quot; offense . </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot; The pride , a Galamatch &quot; host . </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &apos; proud &apos; also - in his capacity as &quot; neighbors &quot; - to confirm that France &quot; has become a team at a very high level , &quot; and the little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna . </seg>
<seg id="2979"> Condemned &quot; Laurent Blanc has done a good job , &quot; he said enthusiastically . </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Although the Belgium in the next European Championship , so does the technicians very well the plane with the blue (the French Nationalelf) share ... and direction; Brazil in 2014 . </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot; We are small Belgians out great , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot; We are one thing , to plan , the players are ambitious , they are hungry . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="2986"> The Hinspiel had been two teams the objectivity . </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot; At the end of the 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine . </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him , there is not the slightest hint of doubt that &apos; La Selecçao &apos; , his Nationalelf , for which he is responsible , since September 2010 will qualify for the Euro 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="2990"> It means , in fact , only 90 minutes concerned for Portugal . </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a match to play , and an opponent abzuservieren , and Bosnia . </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In view of the Hinspiels (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that has not yet been decided . </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal , for more than an hour clear the game , but the team was not able to the cause the important mark of the pressure of it would have taken . </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot; It is a good result , but this is a certain risk , since we have made no Auswärtstor &apos; . </seg>
<seg id="2995"> Homes , however , in the light erstrahlenden Stade de la Luz in Lisbon , the Portuguese are convinced , in front of a crowd that should also be welcome at the game , for , even if the game , of course , as &quot; very close &quot; was announced , said the optimistic , but lucid Bento . </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot; We expect a very close match , but they are completely convinced , to win the upper hand , &quot; said the 42 -year-old Portuguese coach . </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot; We have to continue to be a 50% chance , in the European Cup in 2012 , &quot; watered down , however , the successor of Carlos Queiroz . </seg>
