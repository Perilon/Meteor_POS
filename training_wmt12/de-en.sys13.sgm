<seg id="19"> Only - our lifestyle is not the only and not objectively the best and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help. </seg>

<seg id="22"> The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We were only in a shooting incident, served the interests of Islam and our politicians getting in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit. </seg>

<seg id="78"> More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9% of all pupils and 5 percent of children are overweight. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Recent opinion polls proved - obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> It shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he breeds and examples that surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables adipöser children are sausages to a half more frequently on the table, as in families where normalgewichtige children. </seg>
<seg id="82"> More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the awareness campaign under the slogan &quot;obesity is not a coincidence&quot; chips for dinner. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families with Dickerchen is not just the favourite sports activities, but also affects the majority of today&apos;s pupils - only 15 percent said that their parents at least once a week for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was carried out last year by the end of the school year, were interviewed nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> This was the second year of action &quot;obesity is not a coincidence ,&quot; which is supported by the general insurance company and the company Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> To date, the project more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the surveyed children, for example, five times a day to eat breakfast in the mode of breakfast, lunch Vesper dinner - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet,&quot; is one of the survey results. </seg>
<seg id="90"> No breakfast and sausage for dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, such as the regular breakfast time the family, are important for the healthy development of a child. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic but only 23 percent of the families of the students. </seg>
<seg id="93"> And, in most families eating breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The worst was the observation that in every tenth family not eating at all. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the cornerstone of healthy daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The survey test, among other things, the day that the families of obese children consumed more often unhealthy chips. </seg>
<seg id="97"> And almost everyone - regardless of weight, drinking sweet drinks every day (70%) </seg>
<seg id="98"> Although more than 40 percent of the surveyed children&apos;s sports, but only less than half their parents do, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> If you your own menu together </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), from opportunities offered to appetite and view their own menu. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;What Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favourite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and, of course, fresh food. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet drinks,&quot; stresses in the final report on the poll. </seg>
<seg id="104"> At lunch, so the main court, pasta just before poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Pulses disliked the children, and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as lunch was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Hinkehr to health </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the survey showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits, if they have the right information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the conclusion of the informative lecture&quot; obesity is not a coincidence &quot;that, in many cases, a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy diet,&quot; is in the results of the project. </seg>
<seg id="109"> This was evident in the sweet Limos, for example, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children crossed paths in the questionnaire also much more poultry or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to less dumplings or sugary foods. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit that it was a bit too much fuel for the start. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Because I was not at all, what is to come. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing and problematic characters and a seminar on how the &quot;Square .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is worse to come. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer examination, the more information and practical challenges before us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the rate each on Saturdays and Sundays, he is nevertheless fully documented. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we debated with Director Ethyl (the rate is not a single man participating), as a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And these are, after all, most of us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> A have a short neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is a matter of Stylisten broad shoulders look better to extend the neck or conjuring up the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We also clues to how a type of women like Jennifer Lopez - with a great deal of Finland, a hip and thinner waists - attracts nicely and figurbetont, without being too provocative. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between waists and hips is so great that really suits, the skirt or trousers should be at least a piece of that. </seg>
<seg id="124"> This will not regret it, because good sedentary clothing is simply unaffordable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a, verrutscht constantly high and, in the absteht waists, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Jungenhafte characters can in turn, clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In this quantity of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week time, carefully go through the head. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And yet I fear that to create the House assigned task. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the course was a celebrity, for which they should devise appropriate attire - day and evening gown. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Should we take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and the type of type. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I should Miranda Kerr &quot;attract ,&quot; which you may be familiar from the campaign Victoria&apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Within juble I, because it is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears or attract Christina Aguilera, which has increased in the last time the hundred kilograms (never mind that this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, print, and then deal with graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the Mood &quot;Board ,&quot; as a result, then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is also very important to reflect on the side of the graphic Stylings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The Stylist model is not only physically, but also the so-called product page in the magazine (for specific target, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But the only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This means that a Stylist a good overview. </seg>
<seg id="140"> With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday presentation was peppered from three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word is variability. </seg>
<seg id="145"> For example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, you can but also on the naked body, (shoes to attract and hire him as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is, the sleeves or the collar sleeves and, the whole look quite different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;So,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most came to me but the following advice: &quot;Think you know the rules perfect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Only then can they violate them,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> At last, it is clear to me why we need to all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if on display in fashion journals often quite different. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention of fashion look. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options when he ultimately photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared to stylen at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite differently than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With all of that is so in shaping the attire. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and Styl sometimes half the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> You need only to look at Madonna, not just a brilliant singer, have made the image and marketing a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic is the services of Stylisten rather reserved. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even celebrities often believe that this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I au naturel secondary). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if stylen itself any of us, then we expect that he or she is likely a different (smaller) imposing size, as he or she really needs. </seg>
<seg id="161"> We need to googlen then only to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the celebrity have again or decreased, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario laid on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth &quot;assemble&quot; needs. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> People judge without curry and, in his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If any manager to sift through their clothes, and to complement beautiful pieces, then it does not remove the entire cupboard - my God, this is terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;We must find at least a few good things, which recommends what to take it,&quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also showed us exactly what a so-called &quot;pocket&quot; must include. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So a bag that zuknöpft the waists and bears in all necessary Proprietäten. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In such clear terms, such as scissors, Abroller for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains Utensilien, as a nylon thread (thus helps the Stylist the photographing of products such as handbags or meting out from), specific clips, which tightened up the clothes, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So we have to listen to, but not only, but also can try something, we learned how to unterklebt shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> The photography studio, where the floor, can be destroyed the base, let alone the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Us o klebten and klebten we... </seg>
<seg id="173"> With the gap even affect the shoes are not allowed to, so that they are not damaged. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So we really have to be sent. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario enjoyed myself, my &quot;Commissioner-delegate praised without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> This skill is not just my strength. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second weekend continuation rate. </seg>
<seg id="178"> One thing has become clear to me - the styling to address at a professional level, is not a children&apos;s game. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V Need for steroids: &quot;The run&quot; - The illegal race across America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Recession </seg>
<seg id="181"> The original reckless journey through a series of entirely preventable, dilettantish error on a routine trip to the class. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It was, in large part to fulfil the ambitions, but what is the point when obviously had no desire to do a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part, with the subtitle &quot;the run&quot; high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised that the able games series&quot; Need for steroids&quot; in a new dimension to postpone and the spielbaren examples to demonstrate he seemed actually to be not only one of many Action Rennspielen. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious to know how the eingepassten passages in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But how NFS is so accustomed to, in essence, is much different than we had expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Sure - are potentially quite decent Arkade race, but will reduce the risk of some unnecessary mistakes that are in this series more or less for a few years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather in principle, signs of incomprehensible laziness of the games developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> History will be in the first instance, whose main character Jack introduced certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, on the west coast, set the wheel - with the task to be first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual race. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every race with each other, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> No one has the impression that the game would offer the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some areas are still very attractive, although the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So nothing earth-shattering news. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the trip through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Occasionally bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, is surprised by a desert storm, which reduces the term. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful step that will not be buried by an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Incidentally, are fairly well in the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Only a few, but they are. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle a classic race), it has to make up time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single counterparty. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And this is also the police, who wants to blow the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="206"> A novelty are passages in which Jack leaving the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is more about some interactive animation, in which Jack fleeing from anyone and where he must help the players, he is the right moment the right button. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Surprisingly, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (actually only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> Ultimately, this is the case with the advantage, because it has this element at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game sweeteners. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that from today&apos;s point of view, there are no trees, on the other hand, could not be said that it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren the European Fahrmodell continue quite well, although it could be found in the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then, everything is peachy. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems arise only after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike Fahrmodell is not the collision model quite OK. </seg>
<seg id="218"> This type of a game is hardly to be expected that complicated deformities and collisions calculated, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea as to how the car, then obviously not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Case in point: the close do so or those driving to oncoming cars &quot;scratches&quot; on the other cars only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but went into a tailspin, and wild pirouetting. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or the Karre to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the rest of the system makes nothing, annoying is it all the time. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The rest of Arts are resolved that, if it has destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Only - in every race has only five rest of Arts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If they have been exhausted, everything is starting from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The rest of Arts, rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but we prefer not to rely on. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes helps but not the rest of nature, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some curves must pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise it is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere, the relevant department &quot;civilian&quot; cars are in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent before a romped to two oncoming cars, but until you arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must slow down or avoid it. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it doesn&apos;t matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again regardless of the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> The Madman Estonians, this is at the end of the game in the long bridge in opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The Kontrahent must clearly hell bent on overtake. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And if he is just a, then it is, of course, the point of view, so we drove there initially by car a few times in Klump. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and more exciting but it is clear that spoiled them quickly the joy of the game. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And that is a pity, because despite a simpler Fahrmodell is aktionsgeladen the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes so that we do not know almost more, where one of the head. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And, in principle, no matter what &quot;responsible&quot; - the concept of fifty unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can avoid boredom, or something else... </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race. </seg>
<seg id="241"> We must not overlook the petrol station on the road, because that&apos;s where you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the alternate motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical operations, such as the Serpentinen in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand with the way the game&apos;s history is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the premises of history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> There is not only medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, together for the tasks (challenges) and history. </seg>
<seg id="246"> In order to reach a higher level, drivers must be different items, ranging from cars to the Backgrounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is linked to the online function Autolog at the same time, among other things, its own results compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation last race in history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here is one with the car in a subway tunnel (I), where desecrate kept in the dark on the rail for (or). </seg>
<seg id="250"> On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km/h (or), but it is suddenly from behind a subway and a drive to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editorial will argue we probably still have a long time about whether a blackout of the game makers, or keep the authors so stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases, appealing and sometimes even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz slows and sometimes quite dramatically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> However, this is in particular the accidents with greater number of parties, where a continuous FPS useless anyway. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In a bid to such a broad scale as possible rather young audience, created a Sound Track a lá &quot;from any something&quot; - but anyone who buys such a game because of the music? </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall impression of Need for steroids: the run? The feelings are more mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game is not offset by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have of conviction can claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But the game somehow unfinished. </seg>
<seg id="260"> For a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye. </seg>

<seg id="276"> EU Ambassador Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of kilter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> I would not expect such a hard war flares. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will take five to six years, until the dust settles and we have all become accustomed to their new role,&quot; began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her lecture at the law faculty. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How seriously it takes the motto &quot;Verständlich and openly about Europe ,&quot; they showed in the first part of their presentation, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of the University of Karlsruhe might envy. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;Initially, criticism that he is too low-key - a grey officer, was incapable of such a role, but I must say that it has brought all the time, as well he has taken up the cause. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a person who is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently, communicate with and has particularly clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number to I call? ,&quot; as an important step towards integration and better visibility of the EU&apos;s Policy towards countries such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, the of the European Union, and intends to live in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs had handled the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the summit for the Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The case of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a major negative, which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the ambassador said, it was not only the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet quite hectic. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And it must be approved the seven-year EU budget, which makes it precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget, which will take precedence which countries more or less - all of that is now on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: &quot;Verständlich on Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;If I do not, then it know acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How should I know as citizens, whether in Brussels or round really curly cucumbers and variable bananas dream if someone really wants to ban the Quargel. </seg>
<seg id="298"> They had used the soil of the EU, in order to get more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe of two different speeds or in prospect </seg>
<seg id="300"> The EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation to be Eurosceptics, the more the negative than positive sides of the issue. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write letters and motivation, the weak support for the Czech side. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the successful Czech Presidency emphasised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, believes the Frenchman next to me:&quot; Hey, what is their heads together - is once again your V4? &quot;and it makes a pretty face acid. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Mrs Vicenové according to the EU in the future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states. </seg>
<seg id="306"> As a much fairer, as a &quot;European federation&quot; is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute, fully cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;For the first time, it was said that should cooperate only the countries that want it and those who do not want to stand aside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong&quot; multi-speed Europe ,&quot; &quot;Mrs Vicenová expected. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this regard, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU by all member states, and only by the countries of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Fire story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> They wanted to look for a suitable word that characterized the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word &quot;longevity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public is IBM synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although a century has passed since its establishment. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this longevity, already presented its first chief - the visionary Thomas j. Watson. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he considered the slogan, countless were easily solve global problems, if people were willing to consider a bit. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; was the brand, the lives of future giants should take place (and at the same time, the title of intra-group magazine which IBM in 1935 began). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was also an entire century, because it has remained faithful to its principles and not shied away from everything else around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The allowed us, in the course of the first century, the technologies, the business and to transform the society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, &quot;said Samuel j. Palmisano, the director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary today. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Educational system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson was already in the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the company Baa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the employer plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As more sophisticated IBM&apos;s long-term relationships with their customers. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was brilliant in the talent from the outset - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM any discrimination - and could choose accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, will invariably the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> It is thirty years by IBM, have so far adopted the position of the Vetriebs, head of marketing and strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM makes in recent years, so-called online brainstorming session, from which stem many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No wonder - there is no shortage of ideas, the company employs is almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Their strong position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and after internal and external. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, IBM, the concept of an institution, rather than a mere technology company,&quot; said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that the business problems through technology helps solve,&quot; added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself, there is a difference, to be on the market only present or molding him through this presence directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - in the states of their logos for family &quot;Big Blue ,&quot; has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the militaries developed technology companies - IBM hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible breadth of products - ranging from servers to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Most of all American technology company IBM patents and five of his staff were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or diskette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With approximately $220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was the second largest technology company IBM in this year (after Apple), and for the first time since 1996, Microsoft obsolete. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations, the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system, for example, the attempt OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;Business is based on the forward movement, should not be emotionell tied to the past,&quot; says Samuel j. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> It has no problem, to build its ground on various platforms - and if they are not going to leave it. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike the opponent, Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Ie technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> In the profits of IBM participate to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM veräußerte little profit without assets worth $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in buying promising technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In these investments continued IBM after 2008, when swept the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept the world. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Here too, IBM, the legacy of his first boss Thomas j. Watson, the increase in the midst of the major world economic crisis his investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far, it appears that the company survives IBM today&apos;s crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig at 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> IBM&apos;s corporate slogan is: not everything can be changed - only the values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also, to be expected that resolves this flexible giant the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: From cheese Schneider to outer space flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> The society, founded a hundred years ago in New York International Business Machines (IBM) initially had a rather complicated names - computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The name IBM took over until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> Laid the foundation for subsequent society IBM the merger of four companies, whose history until the 80 s of the 19 st century. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration work begins and endes. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architects of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, which until 1930 had also holds the presidency of the supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas j. Watson, so that helped him with the management of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow of Watson&apos;s ideas to date the invincible culture and identity of the company. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, which betrays the name, with the creation and distribution of all sorts of machines for trade - of sausages and cheese tailors to cash. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company is expanding gradually on all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so essential to the company that he was in the director&apos;s chair for a whole forty years, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Leading IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache. </seg>

<seg id="373"> Twenty years later veräußerte IBM computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the consul aunts part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and hereby fully in the business of Consulting services and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy pays off in the last three years, as is the concept of &quot;Smarter planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="375"> It is the intention to use technology in a wise manner in hitherto not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in urban transport and administration. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In the commercial sector, IBM introduced recently the platform &quot;Smarter commerce,&quot; which is supposed to help dealers, the whole trade cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="378"> In 1932, IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>

<seg id="453"> Voráček won behind the gate of the Hurricanes Puck and presented him between the circles the successful Maxim Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players Patrick Dwyer a Short Hander, but the second third was then Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hit, then drew Wayne Simmonds whose shot on the fourth goal. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I am not saying that he is the best players in the league, but it is one of the best three ,&quot; paid tribute to Jágr his Center. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I would never in my life that I have to finish my career with such ice hockey players, such as with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am pleased about this huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I raise my game to me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All the years in the NHL my players questioned their game to me and now turns the tables on,&quot; schmunzelte Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina made game for the drama - by the hit by Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who had from a penalty shot, there was a goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in two majority against a successful. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Excellent Pronger was still acting in our zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;He got off the Puck, I took on and (Read) to more distant posts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to take him, and I am glad that it has worked,&quot; Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> This victory came to Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defensive players Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo and left in the second half because of a violation of the upper body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Candiens losing up alongside her know Beck their leadership an unverloren Penalty shooting 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> One of the criminal shootings Tomáš Plekanec could not convert. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team the high absenteeism from default on the defensive - the game they played with five defensive players. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;This is bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;The meeting we played only to end with a single experienced players, the rest were young players.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But there is nothing, so we must be ready,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;With every change of a wave after wave of attack and we had nothing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We would make the game easier and Puck from our third rausbringen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> There was still room for improvement, &quot;said p. k. Subban, one of the defensive players. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec distinguished thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg. </seg>
<seg id="480"> At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, had five different trenches. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of the travel prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> By 1989, the then ČSSR only five authorized government travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agents sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were only chosen at the time. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And so, Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea and Hungary workplaces. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and so the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he took a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were not individual trips. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even then, travel agents and travel in the West, but then had to be huge queues in, or spend the night in sleeping bags in the travel office, or at least &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel office. </seg>
<seg id="489"> So was not the cause. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was given only &quot;politically reliable&quot; people - the others were allowed to travel. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Czechoslovakia&apos;s currency was not umtauschbare currency freely without foreign currency, it would have been impossible to the necessary financial resources (Western currency) find for a trip to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The journey most Czechs spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that bought the Czechs countless weekend homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A huge paradox, is not aware of it, is the fact that the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Right from the beginning of the 90 s, the foreign exchange duty in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe lifted, above all, what a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Tschechoslowaken could not get for a long time to travel to the West simply enough, everyone wanted to have at least a few days since. </seg>
<seg id="498"> So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for accommodation in the hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a length of canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna - after decades were able to buy our tourists Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and, consequently, the average salaries rose to what einmündete 1997 in another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by chartered flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 90 s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment with all advanced countries in the world, making travel easier. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of the &quot;velvet&quot; travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, when the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - after Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in the era that our &quot;post-revolutionary&quot; marked development, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, which our country is definitely among the world&apos;s advanced countries brutalized. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time, more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Assembly should find a new chairman - a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR) will be even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known. </seg>
<seg id="512"> To date, there is still no agreement on what is to be elected electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And this is no vote on the three potential successors. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June, Hašek resigned from his post, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to come together and find a strong personality could run the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only - in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two associations chambers again able to agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, as the new leader should be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates at the General Assembly were free of the People&apos;s House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not only about the election itself. </seg>
<seg id="519"> We could not agree about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutory representative or with a power of officials. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in power base is not admissible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The dispute over the election law, however, continue to take. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The Executive Committee did not have more clarity on the matter, whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Even if the views on the election a few times - the worst point remained the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how can we in the 3 st round in order to avoid a stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The point of contention is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model must be found,&quot; said dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the FAČR, representing management in professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to a registered model prevails in the third round the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that the one candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech Republic, on the condition that the winner of the other vote count at least a two-thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;We have the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would put the entire bicameral concept in question,&quot; Svoboda understands the objections of Moravian side that it would be best, not tweaking the electoral law, but to elect under current statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;It is my wish that largely elected under the statute.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So that no unreasonable ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly,&quot; said the owner (the clubs) Victoria Plzeň, particularly Pelta abgrenzte stood for the first time and in his opinions. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta but remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In his view, the new chairman Nymburk known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;If the football until the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more,&quot; said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience, both on a professional, and regional levels. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more circumspect. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes&quot; fudge .&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;It is a new block in the General Assembly cannot be ruled out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;I hope that common sense prevails in the end,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all sides. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generals until qualification at all. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The charter plane, fly, inter alia, Dalai boron Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice, was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all, and so was urgently for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee on the venue of the Barrage Hinspiels. </seg>
<seg id="545"> In the end, then surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education in the country&apos;s divided parties within the largest sports associations would have liked to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot at stake: government grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and also the forthcoming General Assembly of the ČSTV the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka new direction. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík in the battle for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate is </seg>
<seg id="549"> If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate could make that all his ideas on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) had met, he would not discuss it at all to the battle for the top position. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there is a good candidate, then I would fight for him and abandon the election.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;In the current situation, but failed to find such an Adepten,&quot; said Paclík ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for Paclík into duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, it is to prevent the alleged favourites for the election, Pelta, at the top of the FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stressed that he only if he wins the role of the chairman a year, until 2013, until the date of the proper main assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have personally spoken with some of the people in question.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;Hard to believe that some said they wanted to identify with the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Such views would have liked to have changed,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most of all disturbs Paclík allegedly linking Pelta&apos;s link with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association novel Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="559"> It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of the chairman. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;His victory would einkonserviert and the Czech football is not making any progress at all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;The support of Berbr, a cleverem Business Man, the football twice as bad,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> It is also important that Pelta&apos;s name was made some time ago in connection with phone taps to the investigation in a corruption affair came from the Pelta but go unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know what the victory of Pelta (tsch.) should play football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said řekl Paclík, its previous formula, &quot;he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman&quot; looks a little more calmly. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Should Paclík in Thursday&apos;s election win, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta well. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just think of another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great skills.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am putting my nose in matters of which I understand nothing,&quot; said Paclík, who had been in September that he was behind the resignation of the Commission with referee Luďěk Macela was at the Dagmar Damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík claimed, he felt the role of the chairman of the association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the League. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to the cultivation of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which turn up in horrific situations ,&quot; Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of its priorities, the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;This is one of the key things that should be addressed by the new chairman.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;When it comes to the taxation of luck games, such as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, they must also be clear where the money goes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Its link to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap, although he emphasized, the chairman of the FAČR &quot;bipartisan .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;It is not my opinion but also a lot of sense to transfer my shares in the club Pilsner hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years,&quot; said Paclík clear. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the post of chairman, Miroslav Pelta, if elected, he will ensure that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would defuse a possible success of the Czech selection. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided at the last moment, to participate in the election before the last General Assembly, and so did help him the two-month pause to defend his ideas on the running of football and in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels is devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect that the chairman on Thursday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="590"> This is also why he says that he does not have sufficient experience to guide the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June approved statutes that were not perfect, as had all accepted. </seg>
<seg id="593"> If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman, &quot;said Pelta in September. </seg>
<seg id="594"> The review of the most important document of the citizens association he used as bait for the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;I should be president, I take myself personally, and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;This is a matter of principle, without which it cannot be,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition, he is not trying to differentiate themselves to his opponent. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He had earlier announced that he could cooperate with Jindřich Rajchl imagine recognizes the because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Also Tomáš Paclík, he has been for a long time, which in turn, no dry thread Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;The attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;So many doubts about his true nature,&quot; Pelta addressed his opponent, who will probably be his proclamations to which he expressed in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the flagship of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;I would try to put an end to all Affairen - the issue Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately afterwards I would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football,&quot; said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> At the time, he promised that will mean his arrival at the tip of the Czech football staff cleansing. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I would like to start with the job content of all employees,&quot; he said in the direction Strahov, where is due to the length of anarchy understandably nervous. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk in vain. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If that is really the only point of contention, as you choose in the third round, then we come.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility and he is the only way back when he finally has a new leader&quot; remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the work of FAČR below him hard begins </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the current deputy leader Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, would supposedly frenzy that many people in the club&apos;s whim. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that in the case of his election promises to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce changes and the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As chairman, I would like to turn to the football as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national selection, the professional football, to the football for the youth. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;I am not saying that I want to do everything alone,&quot; said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and would distribute the competences of the executive committee that deals with each member pays a certain area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will be distributing hard tasks, so that the football in each segment with. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> Moreover, many not just delighted because, instead of only to criticise the work of others, now itself should begin to work really hard, &quot;he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered no longer to run. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;I know that I am working 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, not me constantly spanners in the works, and every step I am in question,&quot; he said as an explanation why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people have told me that I should not give up, because it would otherwise do others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is trust must not squander it,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Allegedly motivated him to continue the work that he has begun under Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I do not want to throw away now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Processes have been launched, the only in a few years to come, and I would hate to see that they ride,&quot; he said, and hereby expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Miroslav Pelta, could return the situation in the days before Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> I can be some, but not that I would be biased. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I am trying to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I don&apos;t want football for all, because it is all very well, and not just a selected,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> He also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do what is best for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part, the winners in each of the first League visited.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;It could not happen today only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the battle for the post of chairman, dares not Rajchl to assess his chances that he will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I feel a strong support in the chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me,&quot; led Rajchl, saving tens of millions of kronor for disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the fact that the association is not a single hymn sheet. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While Pelta he says, &quot;he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence, he believes that the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate to the football really does have something to offer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;Should he be elected, he would probably continue with things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> He would certainly not things in its favour altered want &quot;judgements Rajchl on his rivals. </seg>

<seg id="686"> German bank leaves commodity business, </seg>
<seg id="687"> By Christian Teevs </seg>

<seg id="689"> After SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the world&apos;s poor. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the company head then draw conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens of the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study that speculating banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents calling that Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report presented to the Food Watch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting that the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore complicit in the world hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of consumer protector is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Commodity bets were initially intended to traders to hedge against price volatility. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But in the meantime, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and profits at the expense of the poorest. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Unlike the U.S. competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to look into the allegations and said that no business is worth it &quot;to put the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an International Working Group is currently considering the allegations from the Food Watch Report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> By the end of the year is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how to deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January to share the top of the bank, what consequences it entails. </seg>
<seg id="704"> In the end could be a reduction of the commodity business, or even a complete departure. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann fusses over his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: &quot;the betting on rising food prices is particularly severe damage as reckless banks today the common good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann stand as top banking lobbyist now particular duty. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, where money is being used for betting on food prices,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The insight of Ackermann at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the head of the company a few months before his departure from office a perfect picture. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned no change in the supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And possible reductions needs to do it - that would have to do, after all, his successor. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Every second commodity assets would terminate </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organisation. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode the poll published on Tuesday, for which the Institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November 1001 people questioned. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just eleven percent believe that it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank facilities offering involving bets on prices for food. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would also personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Every second according to the survey would terminate all facilities where money goes into the commodity speculation. </seg>

<seg id="722"> The umgezogene pavilion </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Mrs Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: the Austrian World Expo pavilion was 1958, prices of Brussels in Vienna to the museum, was empty and descended. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now he will be considered issuing house reopened. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If modern architecture, dreams of clear, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the faith to technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Expo 1958 a striking and well-known example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy, steel and glass construction. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction has, to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He also made the architects so well known that the Austria at the next World Expo pavilion built. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem subsidiary building in Munich in 1973, he became internationally famous. </seg>
<seg id="731"> The planned construction of a temporary exhibition pavilion set up after the world exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, rebuilt and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20th century opened - the &quot;20 s house&quot; it was called. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="732"> It was the buildings but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, the contemporary art in Vienna a new house. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and came more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now has converted the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, he is now &quot;21 s House&quot; and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday evening opened the museum Belvedere, one of the House, where the first exhibition - a fortune in every respect. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Through the restart Agnes Husslein Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein Arco, solicitor art historian with considerable career including the youth than Eiskunstläufererin later Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the museum of Modern Salzburg, the restructuring strongly among politicians and the monument conservationists, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship funds and put the use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> No contemporary art should be issued the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous foundation, a cafe and a bookshop, and there should be an office House had to be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the implementation was then Krischanitz the ideal occupation. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him a &quot;tremendously important&quot; was the place where he &quot;almost every weekend&quot; had seen the exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the Ur draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reconstruction there was far greater problems: the building was an Energieschleuder, &quot;says Krischanitz.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glasfaserverstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Kältebrücken steel sources have been replaced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets were rescued. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two shells made room for the new use, an abgesenkter light gap between house and road provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original external doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old rotbraunen rust-protection color tone. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> The memorial authority and all this under strict supervision and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the monument protection office did,&quot; says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in the underground missile. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the constraints, problems and building the building remained flexible and easy. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It was difficult with the pavilion, &quot;which came from Brussels,&quot; said Krischanitz recently, a typical &quot;dropout in the City history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> So an architecture &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and wants to &quot;create a real awareness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, the 21 s house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke occurred: the Swiss garden just completely new planned &quot;Central Station, office and residential accommodation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke will happen: the 21 s house could increase by another Krischanitz construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin fizzled art hall, and we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden. </seg>

<seg id="775"> The financial market regulators NCUA raises a number of big banks, cooperative banks led to buy financial products with false promises; they have downplayed the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Such papers lost during the financial crisis sharply in value and tore the banks with in depth. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to move the parties in court,&quot; said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The bank admitted no fault with the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="779"> The same applies to the Citigroup, which undertook to pay $20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the willingness of the two finance houses. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and is in bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA tried, which caused billions in damage. </seg>

<seg id="784"> The regulator had other big banks, and in the summer WaMu sued Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> In the mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage backed securities. </seg>

<seg id="790"> Investors and regulators have mounted numerous appeals, in order to obtain compensation or to punish wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave action. </seg>
<seg id="792"> It raises 18 major international banks, the two state housing financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage transactions to the tune of around $200 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="793"> The Deutsche Bank faces a charge of FHFA, there is a business worth a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007. </seg>

<seg id="797"> Finanzguru Buffett invested heavily in IT companies IBM. </seg>
<seg id="798"> Since March he has bought shares with a value of more than ten billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="799"> So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett always said, not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the firms only bad forecast. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Now, however, he read the reports of IBM and changed his mind about investment in the sector. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He must understand much earlier that IBM mainly services and implied beschaffe computer systems for the IT departments of other companies. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment from Warren Buffett is a knight blow in the financial world. </seg>
<seg id="803"> Consequently, the it cornerstone IBM now call &quot;Sir IBM.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="804"> Because Buffett revealed now in the U.S. economic CNBC broadcaster that he bought since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion. </seg>

<seg id="816"> However, his lifestyle is modest. </seg>
<seg id="817"> It is a cult figure for many investors in the world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Almost unmistakable sense for earning him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the Buffett investment, the IBM stock vorbörslich rose by one percent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big Blue ,&quot; as IBM is known, is worth more than $220 billion in the stock market, and, therefore, together with Apple and Microsoft is one of the most valuable technology company in the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he would not enter. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Founder Bill Gates is a close friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is real </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &quot;doubt Turkish media on German Zwickauer cell,&quot; the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology, which auflebe now. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background. </seg>
<seg id="827"> This news will in Turkey and within the deutschtürkischen population in Germany with fear and anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many German türken is a long totgeglaubtes specter: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable violence with more extreme right-wing background against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> In Germany, xenophobia, but never in question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The recent right-wing extremist network shows, however, is not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;The bloody ideology again?&quot; the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper ran the headline &quot;Haber Turk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, &quot;stresses that one of the perpetrators may have been a V man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities might be involved in the extreme right-wing swamp. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Calmly responded to the Turkish community in Germany: you reminded at the weekend with a Mahnwache in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Franco-German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens. </seg>
<seg id="835"> In cheery colours was staged peaceful coexistence - as a history of success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> As a slap in the face of the reporting of some Turkish media: &quot;Germany&apos;s gift to the Fifty,&quot; reads the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &quot;X ,&quot; which cites the background of the series of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The German edition of &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not to consider these ideas. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It starts to stink,&quot; says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He stressed that people have been murdered, paid taxes and would have done with their work made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Highly critical of the actions of the police deutschtürkischen Internet forums, and their search later success. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why the German authorities have not learned much more to search for suspects in right-wing circles, surprised the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> Some shows, at least rhetorically drastic measures: &quot;there is a sloppy approach, there is nothing left for migrants as self-defence and arming.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;This will probably be the best form of protection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;The quality of education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much domestic peace in Germany,&quot; writes &quot;selenium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="845"> What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, clarified the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the burning ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event, the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks ahead but we sense on the Turkish side. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The not repeat past mistakes </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press was criticised at the time, above all, the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, at the funeral in Cologne but represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was then in his speech on how many charges here Turks. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As berechne the value of people at the height of his tax charges. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the domestic rule since then. </seg>

<seg id="857"> The UBS in the financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then has stumbled from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it is going to be a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> It was certainly not intended Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was revealed in July announced that he would make 2013 an almost equally spectacular new job: Board President of the big Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step. </seg>

<seg id="865"> A trader at UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and found some 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland&apos;s vaunted bankers had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the Board of UBS, also damaged - and all ask: when will finally Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> The bank was already known that Weber from February 2012 to discuss. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the administrative presidency assumes he already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber will be hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, an economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At a stroke, he then assumes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just shown once again that they have long been deserves the title &quot;biggest scandal bank in Europe .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and, on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss wealth manager had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On the one hand, the UBS 2007 managed to high-net-worth customers with $1.6 trillion more money than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, it was as an investment bank in the league of the world&apos;s largest banks late. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and subsequent longtime banking analyst Hans Geiger counter in Zurich: &quot;Do student I have portrayed the UBS was regarded as a model of good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From today&apos;s point of view, one wonders: How did I do wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, for the first time that something was wrong came in the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising hochintellektueller in the meantime, as well as ingenuous bankers. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, suspecting he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment bank had been with subprime securities and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In order to cope with the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> So it was in fact investors, but what about some until shortly before the face: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that they did not even have heard his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, there was worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to be new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid Board Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 was followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, on which they could be Miteigentümerin the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole country was shocked, because they said, as dramatic as it is for a small country, if it is so large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again we could not save UBS &apos;, says banks researchers Geiger counter. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first disaster joined the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America, agreeing to publish the data high-net-worth clients who had evaded taxes, perhaps with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> They also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and criminal charge. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus, the UBS more or less open to help in tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal was not Swiss banking secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It followed the resignation of CEO and Board President. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of customers&quot; money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> It had lost the bank within months its credibility in two main business areas: in the investment banking through the false speculation and asset management assistance for tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And, just as it has been somewhat calmer, just as it was thought that now will get the UBS it again, because this is An unfortunate traders history: An individual traders found EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it appears to be: the risk management in the investment banking is obviously still did not work. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed,&quot; says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at Bank Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial management of a large German bank is sure the UBS: &quot;the problem is that it has no risk control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> Was it just the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers for a long time ago, guardian of the major assets of the world: no great risks for safety for money - but also collapse across the Alpine republic in the world. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The Tresore Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli particularly noble chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is only a little bit bigger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road that leads from the main train station in Zurich directly on the sea, flanked by the summits of the Swiss mountains along paths. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers as Tiffany&apos;s here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries, the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bear. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The reception hall of the UBS boards through a revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls marmorverkleidet verge thick leather armchairs, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the &quot;safe .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually betrayed - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS had become too big, he finds - particularly in investment banking, where would spread the Anglo-Saxons. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss had nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its only high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008 was a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;On that Wednesday, the coalition of small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Luke Hässig in his book &quot;the UBS crash.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion approved politicians, in order to save the large bank for the from bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How did it happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> Talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks a huge corporation. </seg>
<seg id="934"> It was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Switzerland - and grew still further. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that supplemented the two different precursor banks UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they could a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team,&quot; says banks researchers Hans Geiger counter. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, higher intellectuals, Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who has heraufgearbeitet from the bank lesson to the top.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel have to rely on Wuffli finish. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: &quot;He thought his models were the reality,&quot; says Geiger counter. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: embolden came in the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The leaders of UBS clearly remember the meetings at which company chief Wuffli purported to be the same slogan: Dethrone Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> They led the &quot;League Tables&quot; rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then the UBS, according to the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps were their success. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she played at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Business advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international interest in the business, bankers &quot;fixed-income,&quot; there is a huge gap among the world&apos;s largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS have gaps in U.S. mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, UBS in an adventure that almost cost the existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, the bank invested both themselves and their seats of hedge funds in American subprime assets. </seg>
<seg id="955"> They became a huge machine that securities on American mortgage loans packaged and passed - but also risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also, as other banks for an exit. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market in flames, has bought the UBS there,&quot; says banking expert Geiger counter. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The euphoria so great, so deeply. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after another had to go to clean up the attempts were more difficult than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Items in the UBS were to be used as a weapon and are still shaky. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Whoever leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which are all obvious business models. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bankenforscher Geiger counter has an idea: stop the investment-banking activities, focusing on asset management to return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> So far, the bank is not (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But that investment banking is to shrink sharply, so much is already clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> On Thursday will present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was intended only as a temporary solution, as the bank surprisingly from predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Now he has won: it is the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to roll back the investment bank in the mid-nineties. </seg>
<seg id="970"> He renationalises 3500 posts. </seg>
<seg id="971"> It will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What they want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly he says only that he would seek with his wife at a home in Zurich. </seg>

<seg id="995"> The investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in an interview CNBC. </seg>

<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that television trucks in the Church Street on the west side of the park photos could have made. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> When the police in the West through the mess of personal matters, the protesters, including suitcases, plastic lawn and bags with clothes, was followed by their city employees cleaning removed what was left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some protesters who refused to go to the outside world were towed, pictures appeared just a short time later on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A main core of protest learning was in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some erected barriers and police continued their methodological arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Approximately 10 people at the epicenter of the camp did in her arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people would chain themselves to trees, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Civil protection officials were called to loszuschneiden them. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> As Mr Kelly, until around 3:30 pm no arrests in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> To most of the arrests occurred, he said, because &quot;disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most prominent local officials was Joseph j. Esposito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officers of the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil t. Pula ski, departmental Chief of Detectives, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Despite his presence &apos;, &quot;Mr Kelly&quot; operation ,&quot; as Mr Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> In the event that they should have waited a second group of officials on the eastern side of the Broad, between Liberty and Cedar Street. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, one block farther south, barricades were set up. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It could be observed, as these sites from the police the area around Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> In one place has been observed, as several officials, many of them with protection signs, drove people out. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Approximately 28 people were in the northern area. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the most violent actions the night took place in the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Around 5 p. m., south of the Pine Street protesters jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tyres of a police bus. </seg>

<seg id="1360"> At the end of a civil servant and protesters to hospital. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Trade union for carers because of a complaint against the city </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union, the hundreds of workers who have lost their jobs last month, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies on the grounds of undue influence on the schools, the poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The complaint is probably the last chance that the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make redundancies, is still open. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school helpers, care coordinators and other staff, who are among the lowest paid employees of the city and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city&apos;s access to a health fund, which had the working groups, had refused to close the budget gap. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> These allegations were rejected by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis m. Walcott, director of the schools, last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the council leapt back and explained to him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that the school aid workers would be laid off. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials of the City council in 37 said that they have warned the Ministry of Education in a lawsuit on Wednesday there will be a press conference to announce the date the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally announced. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The complaint, mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, said that the city would not be the case, and therefore could not comment on their individual claims. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a lawsuit, which is of the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighbourhoods of the city to support a complaint alleging discrimination, claiming that had lost poor schools more workers, because they are chronically underfunded. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> It states that, while there are no redundancies at Staten Island and few redundancies in schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides in District 23 in Brown&apos;s Ville, Brooklyn, and have been laid off 46 workers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South raspberry. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> With the loss of five of eight 36 school personnel in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents who can organise the donations to offset budget cuts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P. s.: the budget of the 36 Javan was reduced this year by 3.26%. In addition, funds have been lost, as the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also complained that the head of the high schools with the language in a memo, which authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo used the English word &quot;excess&quot; to describe the act, even if &quot;excess&apos;: transfer) in the United States usually the exchange of teachers on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty six care coordinators, not handed over,&quot; says the complaint. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission ended, Congress prepared to agree on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Ultimately, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington, on the uprisings in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All that was needed in this regard, the success of the revolt, the arrest and killing of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday the committee on international relations of the Senate, a resolution, which Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph i. Lieberman (Connecticut), which Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their &quot;courage&quot; praises. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya who have started to rebuild their country,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is an affirmation of their democratic support efforts by two parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions on the approval or disapproval of the U.S. military role in NATO&apos;s Libya mission. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution that authorized the use of military force in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day, this bill in the Senate and the chamber also overruling a decision to cut money for American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> It was the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that it was enough to criticize Obama&apos;s approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the rug out from underneath him. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> It was the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate may be willing to take action. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the International Relations Committee congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their own liberation &quot;and&quot; praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their exceptional courage and professionalism. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also reaffirmed &quot;the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya&apos;s transition to democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or to divide the legislator, as it has done the law in June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The final version of the resistance of the Senator Richard g. Lugar (Indiana polis), the top Republican of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new law. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> According to Capitol Hill, the onus is on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term the Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have tried, unsuccessfully, to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that were presented to the Congress and include a range of issues. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are twice - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance in the Senate and another dozen would control federal spending .&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly first-year Republicans who want to burnish their CV - about the possibility that such a measure &quot;written .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to balancing the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> On the budget, some members want the number of provisions that can present the members of Congress to limit, while the Republicans José e. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms of office of the president. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The Republican Jesse l. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a good education and health care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment that prohibits marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen, as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, a rejection of two-thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So, as proposed by the changes, so they move even faster than in the past few years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, lawmakers 77 such changes, changes in the 110th Congress in 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace pales in comparison with that of the early 1990 s, in which members regularly every two years, more than 150 changes proposed, the figures, which the Senate library. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they were not much more successful than today&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Add the last amendment, which is - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already proposed 1789 Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;But not defeated,&quot; Giffords taken in the first television interview after the attack </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election rally in Tucson, they had entered Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) sang on national television Monday night, only to the Broad piece &quot;the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said that the desire to recover, is larger than the returning to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> As they, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News &quot;20/20&quot; appeared, they struggled for words and needed assistance in walking. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The broadcast showed severe slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, shared her skull, durchbohrt the left side of her brain and has crossed their heads from start to finish, has done. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago returned it surprising in the Congress to triumphantly cast their votes on debt brake. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, smiling Gifford, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked her how she felt, replied Gifford (41): &quot;well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an one-hour &quot;20/20&quot; Specials, on the eve of the publication of the new book by the couple recorded: &quot;Gabby: a story about courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you see them in the hospital bed, with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on their foreheads. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> They can raise only one or two fingers, if encouraged her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists to show how they simple movements. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A twitch of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, her first words: &quot;What.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After a few days whispering Giffords another word: &quot;toast.&quot; they want to see changed. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos, which will take place in the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords&quot; recovery: see how the members of Congress, together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Pettys &quot;Free Fallin&quot; .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords who spends two hours a day with therapy that they do not remember the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that he Giffords on 12 March had read an article in a newspaper on the attack when they stopped him and asked for the first time in the six people who were killed during the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forcibly treated medically, while waiting for his trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people have died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly told Sawyer that she said: &quot;I was taken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;Therefore, I would say:&quot; Gabby, you got to be unbeaten? ,&quot; &quot;said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You got to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops feel compassion rather than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street gala, collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> On cue, collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The servicemen and women were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, chief of staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen was observed, the role of the troops. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They were introduced as orphans,&quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure, the organisers have meant well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But there was no respect, not really. It was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and of the most distant, sometimes admiring American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops are showered with praise for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has its price, service members. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly behaving as do the people in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We were not victims,&quot; said Brigadier general Sean b. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it is the only way of support, to put us in the role of unfortunate souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, not the ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve, want to appear. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They have also recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War, was far worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result, there are discussions about compassion in the private sector between breastfeeding and war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons have returned from fighting with the marines, the former Colonel Mark Cancian, they warned that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would consider them with a sense of awe, since they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would wonder whether a &quot;angry, violent veteran beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and has taken a senior government post in Washington after his return. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly, whether he is able to immediately after his return from the pressure of a demanding post in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;If you talk about your service, you must keep their negative impressions about it,&quot; declared Cancian his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Services on the battlefield will be in a country that has little experience with the military, and sees little value in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, singled out only rarely. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We as a nation value military heroism no longer, as it was during the Second World War was absolutely normal,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno admiral, the U.S. troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the praise of the politicians and the public mostly on the suffering of a service members. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week is an important hearing on whether 28 men and women charged with failure to intervene in cases of rape in the military court. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers at night. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Mira Mar north of San Diego back from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, one of the 12 s, Pack beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked whether he should accompany them in her room for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;My alarm went on,&quot; said Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texanerin premonition aside their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: &quot;Oh, no, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas, &quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind them, put them down and they were raped, it claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, made in court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, d. c., the complaint initially 17 claimants, but rose in the following months at 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify and condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attack. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says that they had the top military leadership, because the problem there. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The military is hierarchical,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation to the leadership.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that, since February contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Their strategy: instead of all the claimants lay their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of defence for the Defense Ministry, led by Federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The files of the court, Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be prosecuted for violations by current or former soldiers in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, is not the government liable for injuries inflicted on active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged damage during military service, the plaintiff,&quot; the document says. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Ministry denied any comment on this story. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950 s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear-cut fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In both Iraq and Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time to modernize the military, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And it is not alone in their struggle: three further complaints except their are pending. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School, the veteran &quot;Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> This independent, non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a lawsuit against the military, in which the &quot;personality disorder&quot; diagnosis, rape victims received for them to be dismissed from the service - a standard approach, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women&apos;s Action Network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Their group filed in December complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which they accused their discriminatory practices in their dealings with entitlements for people who have felt, have been sexually abused in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws was submitted independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, according to the sex Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office of Prevention and reporting sexual abuse), the Department of Defense 3,158 sexual abuses. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But most abuses are not reported at all, according to the Pentagon&apos;s own estimate of this number approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases occur each year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in Burke&apos;s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> On this night, she says, they have been asked 11 times, the details of the rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She had a rape kit and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the assault with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the verdict was read out,&quot; says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought the trouble would use. I ran screaming from the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came back to my commander said: that was not his procedure, which was my procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was asked to go to a military psychiatrist, who ultimately a personality disorder diagnosed and dienstunfähig said. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 she was dismissed honorably, so that they receive no support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University law School. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nevertheless, it says: &quot;I think they should move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that will, since it was the first time in question. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am always a critic of the Feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military has lagged behind a decade because they do not possess the same incentive and deterrence, a liability. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &quot;The odds are against them... But it is important for them to try.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will change only when good people are ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff&apos;s lawyer, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will fight the military in this regard, pending reforms,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whatever happens first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik, the only one of many boys who signalled their anti-immigration views online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who has committed a killing spree in Norway in July to have killed 77 people, its first public hearing in court. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Despite Breivik, may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack at his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, as we find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This is easy - you just have to log on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We have found that it was not difficult to reach them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply advertising tool of the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - do as retailers for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups in Europe and visierte them with Adds, but rather with a new band or to connect a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, was asked about their attitudes toward violence and the their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - not just once her office had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a fairly new research method,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results come as little surprise. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a kind of surprising, &quot;those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to be a new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and policy researchers use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends such as &quot;Likes ,&quot; text messages and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, generated Facebooks &quot;data supernova explosion&quot; a research boom, the number of scientific work, with the name of this page title in the last five years by almost 800% increase. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook that can be achieved by the people who do not normally with his Clipboard on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;If you tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;They had to first inform the party and would never have access,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problem drinking as students who remained silent on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, residential advisers to help monitor the side and a student if they too many status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;They can&apos;t solve a problem, if you have not recognized,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co- author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children&apos;s Research Institute of the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also zapft constantly data of its own population. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The data team has statistics on the types of status and Valentine&apos;s Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and produced a national happiness index (which has been used primarily according to the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long understood that should make the their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But the users of Facebook that the side they are, whether they like it or not. with a friend, is thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side&apos;s own personal data sown. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know about? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, everything is permitted. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he explored the public pages of students on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;It was just them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in an user profile and in speeches. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you on Facebook and what outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as a technology researchers that are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools anyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute for the real world and to talk to real people,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research must address the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman &quot;: Anders Behring Breivik, appears for the first time before a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Different Behring Breivik, the man who has had two runs amok, in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, as a &quot;resistance&quot; kämpfer himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway,&quot; he said before a court with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I object to the court, because you support your mandate of organizations have received the ideologies of hatred and because multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik, during this monologue, because he &quot;wanted to give Breivik, the possibility to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he mitbrachte Breivik, an advance written speech, the permit, at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik, for 12 more weeks in custody, he has four weeks without access to the media. He said that the authorities will inspect all visits and correspondence about eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some were able to see in the hope that Breivik, in the eyes of, others wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All took part with the aim that is based on a Wegschließen. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought he looks cold and inhuman,&quot; a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I saw and heard the suspects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing, calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breiviks bizarrem saying that he would be part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; bewegung, the judge concluded that he was mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It may have been some that the attacks of 22 July, was the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But it&apos;s automatically the sadness and confusion, sensing a whole nation still? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not,&quot; said the relatives of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be so much easier if he did.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5. some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a large, modern inventors. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What Apple fans but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview, which was dusted off this week in particular film displays on the major markets, as has understood this creative head business processes and workflows. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-styled Hippie, but he was also a careful organizer, eager to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders to &quot;a disease of thought ,&quot;&quot; a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> 1995, Bob Cringely the TV series &quot;triumph of the specialist idiots&quot; on the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat longer than a hour with jobs, in a rare, detailed discussions. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At this point in time than 10 years have passed since jobs were already had been forced out of Apple, and he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> After Jobs death discovered a full VHS copy in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68 -minute film &quot;Steve Jobs: the Lost interview ,&quot; Mark theatre this Wednesday and Thursday in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who is well known that he abhors detailed interviews, jobs are surprisingly busy explaining its technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly pause. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interviews is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds after its head, which weighs jobs clearly his thoughts and accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when jobs&quot; perfect for days when he seemingly impatient and anschubst him anschubst, faster on issues or minor acts. Responded to questions Cringelys </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the distress interview somehow incredibly thoughtful, if assessed jobs, what other companies he believes is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing, posthumous awards the career jobs&quot; to read, but to see jobs here as the thrill of dreamers, is poised to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things could be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Shortly after he had stated that everything here, and he made it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> As he learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During the years I always wonder,&quot; Why are you doing things? &quot;and the answer you get is:&quot; Oh, this is done. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business think really hard about things. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I have said. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Amazed how costs were recorded - mostly began with &quot;standard costs&quot; on mere suspicion towards quantified and then with &quot;deviation&quot; he adapted - developed an automated factory, who ensured that the business costs could be determined. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> As has been veralbert the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs told of the &quot;Blue Box ,&quot; which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device, in the telephone company could lead slip and long-distance calls in vain. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> On the device was used a lot, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how Wozniak and he would test the Box, by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone, a phone call and then an AT to another, while durchschleifen they so many satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We sent about a dozen times around the globe, and if you go to the telephone, there was a minute later the telephone next door,&quot; told jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we learned that we can build something yourself can monitor the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without it they would be Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs told from a glorious stroke, the Wozniak and he almost withdrawn as they have in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk with the Pope, as well as they could nachmachten Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope even came to telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> In the technology smitten (and unprepared Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts, he sought to build a spectrum meters after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20 -minute telephone call received a part-time jobs for the summer job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;This has had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company that I had seen in old age, and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it with his staff.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later, jobs was one of the HP employees, who visited the research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he &quot;the first desktop computer that was ever produced .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase had a small screen with brown rulers tube and I am smitten with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would at HP as a teenager and attached to the machine and programmes for them. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> As improving innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview speaks about how to invent new products spontaneously. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, when he some circuit boards einbaute, he was asked by a customer, to assemble the entire computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He was working with a payment period of 30 days and had to both the assembly and the extradition of the finished goods. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later Apple reminds him of the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember, forceful arguments... You shouted at me, that it would take five years [in order to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I went out and found a manufacturer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we are building for $15. it was an incredible credible. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies that remain: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he revive Apple, jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in and lost control of their shares. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;We say that you are working with IBM, Xerox, so make a better photocopying or printer, na?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> They have a monopoly stock, so the company is not more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are] people who, which will ultimately result in companies and the product with which the people from the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product genius that has led to this monopoly, will of the people who have no concept of good versus bad products, eradicated - craft art necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This happened when Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990 s can be... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They have caught the defeat from victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> About innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... If you can develop this great idea, and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You learn a lot about its subtleties. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> It must be votes, certain things that you can&apos;t do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> We must remember 5000, these concepts and bring them all... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Ultimately it boils down to the taste, it is that they are trying to deal with the best stuff, have created the people, and then trying to bring these matters to what do. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historian who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health care legislation, as a court case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the same day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political teilende question whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama&apos;s health law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the Office of the services that will take the case to Court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases was a complaint made by 26 States against the far-reaching reform of the health system, adopted last year by Congress, a law that was among the conservative activists across the United States to a buzzword. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed with the hearing. Indeed expected in March, a 5 1/2 -hour bases discussion, probably the result of which will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time of the court decision is known, will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer, who will face and argue in court that is to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, a former Attorney-General under the administration of George w. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federal society, a veteran group that deals with the defense of conservative principles of law. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the Business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process enormously. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner took place a few hours after the court advised on the case, in a Washington hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Service, including Mitch McConnell, the leader of the group of Republicans in the Senate and sworn opponents of health reform </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years the Federal society. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And that does not violate moral rules. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges of the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal courts. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they would fall under principle 4 (c) of the Code, which states: &quot;a judge can participate in fundraising events near legislative and other organizations, with the judge no spokesman, the guest of honor or according to programme can be a host of such events.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this, morality and to alert government activists. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of the common cause-célèbre, a civil rights movement in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Her appearance and her support of a fundraising effort for this event undermined any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would court matter too easily with groups that follow the agenda, such as the Federal society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And Thomas&quot; wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> By contrast, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance court. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Its critics, Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, since it was involved in the defence of the law is to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan is not about to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing is attracting record of $18 trillion in country </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Airline two-track Emirates ordered 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 additional aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is a rare news that a company a contract on 50 of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it is a great deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and the list price for the 50 aircraft will be a record amount of $18 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing, the Middle East, growing gold mine of future plane orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a forecast, published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years, 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two-track Boeing 777 jets. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The gavel mission came from the Dubai airline Emirates. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to purchase another 20 aircraft, the entire lists price to $26 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> On Monday ordered according to Boeing, the so-called Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8 Dreamliner, the vastly improved fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The list price for six of these aircraft is running at more than $1 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is absolutely positive for Boeing,&quot; said Internal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of this particular customer is very high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> So they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which is usually the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so bad, because the country deserves a higher oil price. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important, because it is less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, if oil prices rise, Dihora said. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural hedge,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order from Emirates reaffirms helps Boeing&apos;s leadership position in the market for large aircraft and to keep the rival Airbus SAS, which attacks the supremacy of the A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&apos;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777 - 300 ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, called the customers a higher burden of farm and reach. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> Sister of Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon claimed to have supported the drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorships. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost its candidature for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, won the race for the governorships in the western state. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... You have occupied polling booths, road blocks built... And called on people to vote for the PRI [].&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes for victory in the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo beaten Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which is currently acting governor, was ranked three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers, and urges the other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specializes in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch in December 2006, the military&apos;s offensive against drug traffickers. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The violence still continues. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while canvassing for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> For the PRI strengthens a victory party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man who will represent the PRI in the presidential race is is Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington congratulated and said: &quot;I think that this victory makes us look boldly into the next year.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1731"> &quot;So everyone is helpful, can help Europe out of this crisis,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So, if China and India can help, then by all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Europe&apos;s monetary union has in recent months in a severe debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, Italy&apos;s borrowing costs are dangerous and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece are resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The arrival of heavy debt crisis in Europe raises fears that could plunge the global economy into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries should join forces to support the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag said that any support Asia is channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as buying bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer the European partners in Asia greater negotiating power. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, India&apos;s trade minister, said that &quot;India will do everything in its power&quot; to help the euro zone, because the economy is now suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants to see the euro zone remains volatile and turbulent,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not an option, it is a mandate, because where else are we work for our millions of young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, if they are themselves facing huge economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the American Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India aid for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 or less a day. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;Eventually, they will find that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and spend holidays on the beach, then you have a problem,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro zone &quot;significant knock-on effects&quot; will have on the whole of Asia. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the Pentagon possible cuts in the defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday, as he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security. That set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already rethinking cuts $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts $600 trillion or more necessary if Congress could not reach a conclusion in the spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to a 23% across-the-board cuts and an end to a large number of new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a large cut, carried out on such ill-considered manner, would make the most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously,&quot; Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We would also be forced to separate us involuntarily by a majority of civilian staff and that the reduction would be implemented as quickly as we would almost certainly civilians in order to achieve the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts were in the combat troops, &quot;said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;During the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect,&quot; Panetta warned the serious interference in the budget war efforts. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;Staff have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war, would lead.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The salaries of the staff would be reduced to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would be a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are strongly against these draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they Panettas letter published. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is a result, we cannot live with, and it is certainly none that we should impose.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has increasingly outspoken said the possible cuts, although he has many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he arrived at the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the defense minister a gloomy picture of what could be a military - with skin, but without a core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a brigade without ammunition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;There is an air squadrons without sufficient trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to fulfil the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is an armed force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;It can be a really angry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions &quot;creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crises, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global commitment and response capacity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future military operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> To this list also includes the Fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Coastlines Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, Army and Navy need in order to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> It would stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say that it is an important next step toward rearmament, so that potential threats posed by China and other opponents can be averted. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to lie revealed </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lie in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, is the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The leadership of Penn State is accused of Scooter, which has withheld supposedly reports that has abused a retired football coach sexually abused boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In the last week has been mitangehört on an open microphone mitangehört, as claimed by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers, shaking countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he said renunciations in circulation, which were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in Kampagnenfinanzierung in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, of course, no one forgets that it has seen the media circus that has caused the President Bill Clinton, when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories about Schummeln in school and college examinations are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been incidents where teachers have indicated their students&quot; test answers, so that they themselves in their Leistungsüberprüfungen well. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors to teach the opposite should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception we see? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Many of these lies but as white. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Lies to or &quot;detecting lies&quot; is one that learning for every human being is important, both for personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a parlor game such as host Aden, where the aim is to call &quot;possessions you! &apos;, is an Enttarnen of deceit a serious knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the past six decades of prestigious universities that had far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> As a result of research is that most of the old myths about the lies were exposed. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies a look in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They sputter, fumbling, blush and zappeln not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> They do not, however, that detect liars and difficult to treat. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, by something about the structure of the claim that the subtle facial expressions, learn about and timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years, the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of exposing to investigate, and it is clear that this is a modern ability Enttarnen of deceit, which is easy to learn and help us in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of persons or negotiations or management of its own professional responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are very good to see other people to raise their interest and to control their own emotions. And they intuitively how they are perceived by others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people often lie than introvertierte people that men more often &quot;selbstorientierte&quot; lies more than women whose lies more &quot;other&quot; - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that their partners less often than unmarried people lying married people (but the lies they tell that are mostly &quot;big lies &quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if a person as a culprit was exposed, others feel less guilty, this person to have lied. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> As you can see whether someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, while you watch the normal behaviour of this person. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &quot;Baselining,&quot; the starting position. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It is a point of reference for later assessment of changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> You watch the attitude, the laughter, the quality of their experimental person. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> They should know better, but when someone normally constantly with the foot behind, so that they are not wrong to blame him if he during meetings with the foot behind. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then you accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these accumulations as alarm bells, bells, not as evidence of drug-dealers. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who are, perhaps, if they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet in the door or they are in the process, change their position in a significant way or show a &quot;relaxation after the recruitment interview,&quot; this deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Questions signal often mistakenly that recruitment of conversation is over, only to this relaxation after the recruitment interview. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> You also pay attention to the language of your experimental person. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The gaffes of Scott Peterson is famous, as he used the past tense, as he claimed that his wife was killed still live and a national search for her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Deceptive individuals can also use a sporadic language: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky,&quot; or if a vexed question repeated in its entirety. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use &quot;qualifying language&quot; when they answer a vexed question: &quot;Well... To tell you the truth... As far as I know... In good faith.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This will give the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which often sounded the alarm bells. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen of lies, but you can learn skills, which is a drug-dealers. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Thanks to these skills can be any more victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> Controversial plan for a pipeline will be revised after exposure to delayed U.S. approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and at the same time to delay, which the unions angered environmentalists, is that the pipeline would provide companies sought to plan the project so that we can return to normal. </seg>

<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real step forward,&quot; said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new Umweltüberprüfung, has ordered the Foreign Ministry, may defer a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task for the State Department and said his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 1700 -mile pipeline, linking Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> This would have to pass through the pipeline in six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Environmentalists they hate, but labour markets love it, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the legislators Nebraskas who are against the plan, if the laws, a departure from the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is whether a lobbyist who was stopped by Trans Canada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, is mired in a conflict of interest. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company contracted to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is with trans Canada. </seg>

<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because those who stashed accumulate dollars, it is not easy for this to work, to invest or to use it for anything else,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="2089"> As long as we think that the people because of the music, it reminds you that you are the music and what it has created, must be careful not to be determined by a famous rock star. It has never interested anyway. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> What memories you have of your project Mother Love T-bone? </seg>

<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed, for so long. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), with the band, a friend of us, when I hear a song or see photos, I think what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh.

<seg id="2108"> Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting, because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The two came to tears when I heard how Ed they played, they are very dark lyrics. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects, in addition to the disputes about the fees with the tender. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban tender on 16 doors opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid-1980 s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitan Bishop Ana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was even in figures compared with the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and bottom (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification Collserolas as a natural park playing with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> As a model was no longer the Central Park, but yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far as it was, as the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions for further access gates after Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of the parks. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone at the gates to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city as a topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste who meet in the elevator, can turn. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it is this fact provides the fuel for one of the rare common ground between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán &quot;it is necessary,&quot; after the attack on the coast on the &quot;frontline&quot; in the mountains, &quot;the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;We should start from the principle that is the park overlooking the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;judging the architect, for the title&quot; gates of collserola &quot;a&quot; &quot;is in itself: they must not&quot; imagine than access to a park, but as a narrowing of areas where action must be taken. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a &quot;intellectual challenge ,&quot;&quot; some risks .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risks as a result of the &quot;uncertainty, which entails the creation of a public space today&quot; after the experience from the 1980 s in the field of Forum had their &quot;swan song .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is its own limits to what can be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Something always means to determine the next step,&quot; i. e., to cross. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We must consider a new urban planning instruments, because the current [regarding the plan General Metropolitan Bishop Mariano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol, keeps close to the matter, says that the side of Collserola towards Valle Sana, &quot;can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ,&quot; for purely topographical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronage de Collserola, not the &quot;should fall on deaf ears ,&quot; although he was grateful that it has given his body, the possibility of this project&quot; from the outset .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition, it says that the proximity of the city of escort letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he has expressed his &quot;doubts&quot; about whether this technical profile which launched multidisciplinary teams (&quot; exactly the right thing, &quot;he says,&quot; We should architects should only be a tool. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tendering conditions of Collserola lack a global vision: &quot;there have been advertised 16 competitions in the sample,&quot; he says, &quot;on the axis mountains. But there is no Längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has led at least in his case that he attends the 16 championships. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway would clash with the architects of the Tors. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, should guarantee the city that is the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, which is a soft transition between city and green zones. </seg>

<seg id="2267"> MSS announces a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity in </seg>
<seg id="2268"> It is Mexico&apos;s social security fund a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by the IPN specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto Mexicano - IMSS del Seguro Social (Social Security Institution Mexico) announced that it is a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title &quot;genetics of obesity in childhood and youth&quot; is to be found the genetic markers associated with obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz López, the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Division for medical research, focus biochemistry) in the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can come to the sports fields of IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8,00 am tests with children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation at the sports venue of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) began, and since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the target of 500 to 600 people, the study achieved at the sports venue of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and the continued Moreley (in the north of the capital district). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the anniversary of the diabetes worldwide, he said, it will seek to three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents&quot; nutritional questionnaires. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family medical history, risk factors, which could have diabetes or kidney failure, to control. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He also said that, as measured by the so-called Saturdays investigative persons (weight, height, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López stressed that this would take place at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain in young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 that had increased in nearly six years, the proportion of obese boys at 77 percent of the girls with obesity at 47 percent, and the obesity has risen dramatically,&quot; said the expert of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because of differences in the genetic history of the Mexican population from that of other peoples. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He stated that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% on average indianisch American, to 5 percent to 30 percent of European and African descent, reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity in the inability to press the surplus to us of energy (calories) to burn, so that it will be stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers said that the direct benefits for the participants, in a comprehensive study of the children, which would be whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It would even the of a different skin wrinkles in the neck and arm of the Interior (Akanthosis), the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All information would be kept confidential and told the parents in writing by the doctors, the doctors tell the parents all measuring results and beat them with lifestyle changes, which are for the prevention of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz said López, there were three fundamental factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the time of the day in front of the television and transport to go in for short distances on foot. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high caloric intake, in other words, an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Standard (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and genetics in this research project is to be analysed. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt from UNAM prevent potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Would the message emanating from the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes, when the rainy season in Zona Metropolitan Bishop Ana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if it were the travel and the maintenance of Asphaltbelags, the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture &quot;bumps from a technical point of view,&quot; he said on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible for developing with Polymeren modified Asphalte to produce a similar mix asphalt, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Mr García-Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, for example, some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of the low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface typical zähelastisches behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that the high temperatures approaching 180 ° C behaves like a liquid, it is very viscosity at 120 ° C and 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;This is not the resilience of the Asphalts on the road uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations ,&quot; the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researchers said the FQ, the majority of the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road surface from six layers of material zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the upper classes is a layer of asphalt, from small asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each piece this decay class, had been sweating in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles themselves, and generating forces, this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot;If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better,&quot; said the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &quot;On the decay class,&quot; he tells us, &quot;is being interpreted a final class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, sweating in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Since this class in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the wear-and-tear class and they must produce friction. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> The road surface receives most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and material from which it is, must be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather conditions, in particular, moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all, the water, &quot;he said,&quot; because it affects the behaviour of the decay class significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the was wet, water in the class and only difficult. This caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and, consequently, the incidence of blow holes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If there is a pothole, &quot;he said,&quot; will first of all the deck flattened class, while the decay class afterwards, but the damage was not immediately affected, but it is a process, at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Which is a member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores Nationales Research System (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the incidence of blow holes, so must the thickness of each layer of the surface are always in relation to the vehicle, and it must be ensured that in order to frequent blow holes this regulation will be met. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research to achieve, for example, Asphaltemulsionen who are in other countries already on the market, and the potholes and repair without application of high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What was missing the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors is that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia is not. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> EL Valle receives his 14th misstitel. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time had to be Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the band, a new Miss Colombia, to them. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar, has joined the Americas at 14 Miss title and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had kept the crown almost. Among the Misses proclaimed: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question facing many today is: What was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The decline because the result is a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain, the Queen of the police and the Mejor sandbanks Jolie Vogue, who had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and took the crown of Miss Colombia home. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor is seen as crucial for the jury&apos;s decision to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question &quot;which book has influenced you the most and why?&quot; by Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta litre Arias Leamos was not convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca the questioner replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I quite believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book that shaped my childhood,&quot; the Little Prince &apos;, is a very deep. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the moment I read &quot;crime and Punishment,&quot; it is a book of universal culture that we should read it. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, &quot;passions&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that was met with skepticism, firstly because of &quot;civilise&quot; and, secondly, because they do not specifically how each of the book they had improperly. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, to feel calm and happy with the outcome: &quot;the universe is wise, it is what has to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all people: please read a little bit &quot;The little Prince &apos;. it is a great book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things, that is out of love of El Valle. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the Priority measures that all Beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), &quot;the other candidates jealously what stresste the Queen, who could not shine on the stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And that, in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and two lifts during the coronation ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although she appeared safe, lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme &quot;Como en casa&quot; the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, &quot;shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, not ultimately Queen &apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> It was at the end of the press - a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie could not convince regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the National beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they sought a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Beauty for Miss Colombia alone is not enough. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social sense, that they are already participating in the competition had worked on projects,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, said her in the stomach area, had sinned, but this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for &quot;natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán said, is that Melina did not have the best body that there were better, &quot;but the problem with the fibrosis in the stomach, for me, honestly was hard to say, put their score on the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should get it right. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this prize, the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing suit a cruel prediction, which should be in the middle of the night. It was getuschelt that had been Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, they enjoy the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their for a year, not as the Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will be one of the queens, who had escaped despite their overwhelming outburst of Cartagena, go down in history. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> It was the work of the doctor, who identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A Lophoskopist from Cali, as the man who &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; identified in history. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials plays a key role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On 4 November was a Lophoskopist of the investigative unit of the Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office (CTI) from Cali, as the man who the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; by comparison of fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, had this week&apos;Elia Tsar González on-call service, a man from Puerto Tejada in criminal investigations and proceedings for the last 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career Chocó González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go five days in the jungle, in order to achieve the place where the bodies were he should identify. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> 2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie, which is investigating the skin is exposed to the friction, that is, the flesh and blood. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week the use against so-called Alfonso Cano recalled&apos;Elia Tsar, put clothes for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Great things expected of him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he flew in by helicopter Palmira to Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that the man, who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, could be, which is why he should the Ten fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name) take. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> When he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the corpse was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, which resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had a beard and was dressed like a farmer in the area, no glasses and was much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don&apos;t lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifying glass to ink a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp&apos;Elia Tsar compared the fingerprints of the cadaver with fingerprints on the story. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He had seen right: It was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Nor was this the same night from Puerto Tejada originating man responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was the leader of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> To trace search </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali was the acknowledgment that the President Juan Manuel Santos&apos;Elia Tsar González at a press conference on the use of &quot;Cano ,&quot; very important. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people are not familiar with our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten not only identify corpses, they also support investigation of murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of those arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they were arrested many offenders false identity papers, or they have not. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take the fingerprints and look them in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researchers told us that he is in a theft had to grab a piece of wall of a house, because the thief had aufgestützt precisely at this point, in his hand aufgestützt a cramped safe herauszog with jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;Walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have the imprint of the machine and the offender, who had participated in several thefts,&quot; he recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The fingerprints can also be burdened murder suspects or discharged. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently, a was surrounded by bottles of spirits. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> The investigation was that it could be a family member under suspicion and, in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, but the place where the offence was committed, in context. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist CTI declared that &quot;the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen the object.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If they appear, used a Pflanzkelle or a band for the carriage. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> And then sent the prints to Asif, the criminal database, or to marital status. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented,&quot; said the expert from the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He said that not everything is as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As gold is not all that glitters is not everything it touches, a fingerprint. </seg>

<seg id="2379"> The &quot;outraged&quot; call on the authorities in New York, </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators packed in tents on the&apos;s Zuccotti Square. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> Much of the evacuation orders came to and changed its location in a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street this Tuesday called on the authorities in New York, as they sought a court warrant to enter the Manhatten Square, after they had been cleared in the dawn of the place and had tried to occupy a different part of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators packed before the Zuccotti Square, with a court order that the &quot;outraged&quot; the renewed tents at this point, wanted to gain access. Meanwhile, another part of the movement of the evacuation orders and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen Square, we are in a different place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement &quot;Ocupy Wall Street.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray said that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; at the evacuation of their tent camp, which directly by Michael Bloomberg, had been ordered the Mayor of New York, and came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings an Order that the forced evacuation of the square and threw supported the protesters&quot; tents. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition, occupied the &quot;outraged&quot; a New park, which is at the crossroads of the centrally situated Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> They were able to occupy the place at least one hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can give no precise figures. He told the news agency Efe that he saw including several journalists with handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization stated that it had joined hundreds of people at this point, which were also a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Now, the&apos;s Zuccotti Square (a site in private property) closed pending a court hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday, and the legality of the dawn&apos;s clearance should be analysed. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some of the seat backs demonstrators wore photo copies of this court warrant and distributed it to themselves, and they gave them some policemen guarded the place, which led to &quot;some small clashes ,&quot; as reported by Bray, who had indicated that some police officers had beaten demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The judicial order prohibits the authorities, members of Occupy Wall Street to remove and the use of &quot;laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to ban the protesters with their tents and other things that they had used before, back in the park.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> Mayor Bloomberg is clear in the press, on the basis of this court warrant for public transport and the re-opening of the square demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws allow them to re-engage with tents and sleeping bags in this place. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The mayor defended the clearance of&apos;s Zuccotti Square, carried out at dawn in the nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators&quot; to contravene the law. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg said he would have been the order for the evacuation of the place, because this &quot;had turned into a place to which the people&apos;s, but to break the law and in some cases, in order to harm other people&quot; because &quot;some shops had received threats and the residents&quot; doubtful &quot;about their quality of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The evacuation at the crack of dawn and shows that Bloomberg was disgusting basically on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman for the movement, the mayor anschuldigte &quot;not to respect the freedom of the press.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The leaders of Occupy Wall Street &quot;informed that they thought about it,&quot; major action &quot;for Thursday to organise, together with local organisations and trade unions in the two months that the protests since the 17 September now to take. </seg>

<seg id="2418"> With a stronger currency are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big technology companies. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September on the listing of the yen. </seg>

<seg id="2429"> With the soaring risk premiums way of the peripheral countries and spreading uncertainty become lost Greece further into the labyrinth that breaks the major European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek interim government is a response to pressure from Brussels is a genuine conviction of political forces is slowly by the facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Mr Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that at the time of his appointment agreed a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, the new austerity measures and support his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February, will withdraw. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October,&quot; assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will meet tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Nevertheless, it does not Samaras communication doubts about his position: &quot;We have committed to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader was a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body of the 8000 million that Athens must entsperren. He made it clear that he would accept no commitment on the implementation of the austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, which is concerned about the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum still confirmed again yesterday, their request was not to shake: the economic aid would not signed, if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek political parties&quot; not a clear written agreement as soon as possible. &quot;NONE. </seg>

<seg id="2440"> The Queen said the &quot;dominant&quot; position in relation to this type of financing </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Spain has a dominant position in the role of micro finance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain in the last two decades, the world&apos;s second donors have to this means of international cooperation. The &quot;essence&quot; is based on the fact that it is a &quot;tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that these kind of deals &quot;absolutely vital&quot; to achieve the United Nations until 2015 the millennium objectives and &quot;in particular, the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, below the poverty line .&quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continues&quot; to the network of beneficiaries&quot; until the last corner of the world, and it is this task responsibly, &quot;said the Queen Sofia, hopes that the initiatives and contributions of the summit, which lasts until Thursday,&quot; the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women &quot;as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;We have had many successes&quot; and &quot;face many challenges.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to push &quot;two fundamental objectives.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> The Queen, said it will seek to have until the end of the year 2015 175 million poor families access to financial services and that ten million of these households exceed the poverty line. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world back to the way &quot;initiated by Muhammad Yunus&quot; years ago, the Queen Sofia as an&quot; act of justice and recognition .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2449"> The father of this financial instrument described it as a &quot;admirable idealists who have committed to the fight against poverty&quot; and whose work they have known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh, the lending strategy on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience was followed a year later, the first world summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all &quot;we are seeing a steady development ,&quot; said the Queen, whose commitment to this project their yesterday&apos;s assessment as&quot; head of the family &quot;in Valladolid and as a&quot; champion of the poor .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her speech by Queen Sofia to participate in the debate and the search for solutions in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity &quot;an ethical imperative&quot; for the whole of the democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, they stressed that it was a mistake to link aid in times of economic boom, because it would be a &quot;lasting commitment .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez was of the opinion that the microcredit is a &quot;serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty ,&quot; and that the governments of the industrialised countries&quot; now more than ever &quot;to work according to unified criteria, should not be allowed and that the solidarity of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, the microcredit, &quot;one of the most important forms of aid.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded &quot;the success ,&quot;&quot; marginalized &quot;people,&quot; always closed doors &quot;to give&quot; hope &quot;and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, was staying in a city,&quot; their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes that the EU president to choose on the basis of general vote </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Christian Democrats (CDU congress on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, German Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real trouble. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has been held in the autumn, particularly those activists would be enough to ensure that the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Among 1001 delegates voted against only nine, ten had abstained from the vote. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation lasting several minutes, on the basis of their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble, a few hours later, the three European secessionist-minded Finance Minister no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the application - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot;not less but more Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &quot;there are nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> The Chancellor is &quot;the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could come through the control of the European Union a reinforcing modification of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro zone, as could be, however, in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote &quot;to give Europe a face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> However, this is definitely one of the request for proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 rapidly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the chief of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The milestone is, however. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Also rejected the delegates in an overwhelming majority, the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, which would be an awakening of Germany&apos;s position. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> To calm the climate within their party named Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. They did not, however, their Congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; or in difficulties European countries to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> As far as the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship ,&quot; calls Angela Merkel France devotes a paragraph on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not directly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago was at the centre of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What represents the fraud in sickness? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the family allowances are UMP and the government now sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to go to a family aid coffers and a speech on the - since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against fraud, as well as social, economic dependence on the state. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy in a tough test, on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, wants to focus the majority of workers sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> With haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government is seeking the introduction of a fourth day of leave of a sickness occurrence of workers in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of specific company would lose the wages of four days, at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure which, according to the newspaper &quot;Les echoes&quot; anger threatens to provoke would, however, to EUR 280 million. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And were accompanied by a different measure rather symbolic nature: the state officials unvergüteten day of leave in the event of illness (so far there for them, the Gegensatze to the three days of leave in the private sector, no minimum period). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Meanwhile, these issues in the debate, the majority also of the issue of fraud, and this time aimed at the abuse associated with labour shortage. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Checks will be much more important, and there are rückzuvergüten, if requested,&quot; Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent actions seem a little unproportioniert in the areas of sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is in fact, already since 2002 under constant observation and political campaigns, which have borne the most fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> However, the first nationwide paragraphs. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the country&apos;s sickness benefits CNAM were paid out in 2006, more than 237 million daily. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of health care, the daily compensation in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and accidents and 54% on sick leave, i. e. EUR 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And so, 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010 the French were granted to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> Midway, covered up the differences: a, in 2007 by monster. Com, a website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40 surveyed 000 individuals French workers, not a single sick day. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another, this time by the health insurance, study makes it clear that 37% of the sickness in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% of between one and three months and 11%. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared with its European neighbours, not the French workers more than elsewhere to incapacity. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One in 2010 of two researchers of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (disease or otherwise) oszillierte, and in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud in sickness is a tiny proportion in terms of undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The fraud is achieved only a weak levels. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there is systmatische controls on sickness, which exceed 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, the CNAM (public school for education and training of technicians and engineers) noted below 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285,000 of the past, short-term sickness, which in 37,050 cases, &quot;unjustified or too long.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the systematically controlled hospitals reporting cases of more than 45 days duration was under 1.2 million 11% &quot;unangepassten or unjustified&quot; cases, which is 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Overall, this makes 169,000 cases of &quot;unjustified&quot; several million workers who have made use of a sickness occurrence. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A paragraph, which represents only a weak levels such as those of undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP MEP Dominique Tian, who in July published a report on this issue, that is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss of earnings per year, i. e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation last. </seg>

<seg id="2519"> Euthanasia and suicide free death to be legalised, a panel of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada says </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources, and also about the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society lives in an attitude towards the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians are in fact, to talk with their doctor about conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent society EIU, who had compared the death in 40 countries of the Erdballes. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada has placed on the 10 th, the study noted that &quot;the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the overwhelming desire of Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of those in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> The whole country, the rate of 86% in the hospital deaths occurred in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report&apos;s conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already said, any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, illogical. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> But now there are, according to the experts who have inspected alike all those countries, whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization abuses in its application, would lead to the practice of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide unkompetenten or not consenting individuals. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, encounter a lot more cases of such violations in the countries that are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is illegal in Canada, where they are clearly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Suicide suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal,&quot; says Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> Canadians are in favour of euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let us remind ourselves that had already carried out in 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll said 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, since they are of the opinion that this would allow people at the end of their life journey to alleviate their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that was not the issue of euthanasia, to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Regarding the persons who already have an assisted suicide, representing 41% of respondents to the view that this should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> As for maintenance or suspension in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Similarly, in its recommendation list that should be stated that the criminal law that the dumping of the funds, which have been a legal opposition, should not be regarded as criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The panel of experts also requires that should be trained health care professionals in the duty to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to provide the best palliative resources, and also about the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, the body of the Canadian institutions for health care, far-reaching means of pain relief or lebensabschließender measures used at least to consider, because this is neither as euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and spawned in the same procedure. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Reservations other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some legal experts in the field of health care have reservations about the conclusions of the experts&quot; report of the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Council Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts described as &quot;extremely ,&quot; among other things, because of the practice of euthanasia practice in hospitals in the final stages of any borders. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone, lebensmüde and more than 18 years to ask someone else to help him in his suicide,&quot; RA Deschamps, who had looked through yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Council Deschamps stressed, the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values that are involved in social fabrics of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> But now, he says, there would be &quot;guidelines and obligations in a society.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> Margaret Somerville, one-rule-for-one-and-one-rule-for-another health law, also has a &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the conclusions of the report, which they described as &quot;per euthanasia manifesto&quot; not long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the report claims on the failure of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts about dogmas should win </seg>
<seg id="2678"> There is a matter that is not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of, this is certainly the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to take an election meeting as a reason to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only if they explored the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data footing. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, will have to a huge share of the world&apos;s population on a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources in order to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from the environmental debate lost subject, forgetting to combat climatic irregularities. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision, the need to find a replacement substitutionsfähige source, even in Switzerland, the barely intends to build only nuclear power plants in the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against continue with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States have decided, after Fukushima to connect their park another unit, using the following the nuclear accident in Three Mile Island plant back in operation. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Even if the on renewable energy sources, German model is presented as a model, contradicts the reality of the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, by the increased use of gas imports increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in the gas and coal-fired power plants, CO2 emissions. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is cause for reflection. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is on the one hand, European leaders in wind energy tables, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, used in rotation with wind energy; so are its CO2 Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French households higher electricity bills by 40%. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Because the price of energy in the globalised economy, a key element of competitiveness and stability of the industry on national soil, the French companies on the basis of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy, which is the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Polls showed that a price to pay is the vast majority of the French nor prepared, as opposition to the principle of this energy source. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 inferred jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Due to its strong export nature brings with it a host of small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> Should France to take a decision to withdraw from nuclear power, it would be the most of these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would wither away more and more. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> The electrician would work at sixty years designed EPR, if it is inevitable that the decline in its producers? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In order to solve the energy equation, there is also a little like a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Developed by the company Areva, low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are testament to the complementary nature of the energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have a security authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The working teams, who have made a name of their professionalism, the security idea just obsessed. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one in Three Mile Island happened is under normal operating conditions; so he was without consequences for humans and the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> Chernobyl was the drama created by reactor design and unendschuldbares, causing human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of several thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as well as they did so after the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As a result of this approach and cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and manufacturers of nuclear power plants, the EPR draft, which enable resilience in the face of such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Under the electrical engineers is deemed desirable, to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition of Areva and EDF liesse by giving them free rein to the position of leadership in the inevitable nuclear power development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is inevitable and legitimate, looking for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate, the equally determined with economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is a burden or opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Under Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s immigration policy has been criticized for a variety of angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of the figures submissive policy, this policy with the status of a &quot;country of human rights&quot; as France had branded themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently, the harassment against foreign students of regulatory side, the interior minister had the weeks look passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that it has &quot;no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad is needed. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this policy was analysed only rarely from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> There is a wide consensus on this issue between right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> The right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed, including about 2 million immigrant workers, should be no problem for a country,&quot; from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had made 1990, France &quot;could not accommodate all the poverty of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the level of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005 on both the right and the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Both camps were perceived the immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference in the level of generosity, and is willing to admit the immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on trite to point out that partnership development will allow it to our &quot;migration&quot; problems to solve. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, an issue that can affect the elections; however, it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book in mind, the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus exists among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Limit immigration would weaken growth and labour market situation. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threaten indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace, putting pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> However, experience shows that immigrants are more complementary than than the local wage workers, because they are jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet arbeitsplatztechnisch. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low skilled immigrants work in sectors that indigenous wage workers, the higher quality among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not in line with the labour supply. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive wage effect </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten that complementarity between locals and immigrants have a positive effect of immigrants immigration on wages and domestic labour market situation. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants miteinbezogene long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants creation and is conducive to economic growth (high proportion naturalized immigrants under American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants also contribute to net the social systems, in European countries on average in excess of 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget, on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start of his mandate, the lack of contact points &quot;with the teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The question, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy, to rethink the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a sensitive material. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should remind themselves, who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the gulag, but also in Franco&apos;s Spain, Salazar&apos;s Portugal, and the Supreme in Greece have had to endure. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some were believed that it would be sufficient to exercise the right to vote, and is progressing possible way to democracy to prevail over their enemies. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know since Napoleon &quot;small&quot; that it was a feature of the spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient, condition and may well become the &quot;repressive instrument ,&quot; as it was at the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost policy and democracy crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The change of the Greek enabling cardsharper referendum would have had twice insightful character in this respect: once the need for a strong return policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be seen as outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that have shifted to the front lines of the democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised by depending on the needs and perverse sequence. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free licence for European absolute ruler or a leap with in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want to Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one, moreover, was no longer know where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is an Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from his powerlessness and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is an Europe that is humiliated at international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> It is concerned about sovereignty transfers in Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and each individual achievements nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project back. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of debt, from the markets open and to build a future investment. </seg>

<seg id="2763"> I agree. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind - to the citizens, would be a folly and another impasse. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could almost get this impression. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For several days to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditional republikanischem focus, reported. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> On China, Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans. </seg>

<seg id="2839"> He had a solid, but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also called Obama&apos;s current position). </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream gas pipeline, on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, was put into operation. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> They should provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Over 500 boardroom, including four leaders, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany under the sea directly. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise Russian gas tax Ventria&apos;s films together, which to the Western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year through a pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the region St. Petersburg Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, supplied to Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second pipeline, amounting to a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is allowed to be completed by the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And it can be referred to the possibility of building a third pipeline along the route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this enormous provide as a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was controversial in Poland and the Baltic states. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream pipeline will make a direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any route, through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to contract access to western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, most involved in the debate was not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a &quot;new Franco-German sowietischen pact&quot; in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to compare the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has won the endorsement of the Russian project an even greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> In barely five years Russia has managed to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and their gas run out. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way,&quot; François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by pointing out to what extent are the large gas contracts of political and economic side. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smile in Lugmin number of Gazprom managers regarding the Gaszuleitung. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete shelter to protect them from Schiffsankern. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the seabed at a depth of approximately 200 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> The building had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;As hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,&quot; Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It had to be taken stronger measures to protect the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The line is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing, either through valves, or maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A control platform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained from, as the Swedes have little eager, a Russian state company in a permanent way to match its coastal settle. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the event of an accident contract we Gasdurchlass in less than a minute,&quot; clarified Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak leaks in the pipeline and gas in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> In this case, the designers, however, than just unlikely, since it was estimated the sweat completion of a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The government&apos;s monitoring of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot will to external surveillance purposes by a sea, as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It has the form of a cigar, attaches a metre diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three full days of moving through the pipeline at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformities of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to function for fifty years, without the slightest undergo repairs. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This is 200, 100 in cash to the access cash at the exit. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have united to achieve this project their forces. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Attached to the German companies e. ON and BASF attached (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie group GDF Suez, the French companies (9%). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It is located in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly good. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom has the entire capacity of their Gastransportes hired out then this society, and on renewable twenty year contract. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how big the real from transporting volume,&quot; clarified Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the pipeline construction was at 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> The minority shareholders are sure to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline is a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip Lugmin from the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The 4.5 metre high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measuring pressure, temperature and other indicators of the gas, arrive before transferring this in the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas verstreichende per hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and $6 million in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a trademark note book. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created by an Italian company approximately fifteen years ago, would like to express Moleskine now the letter back new style. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has a flair for adventure, by candlelight with the letter zugebrachte hours. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine note book is again, with his black, rechteckigen cover, his rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen sides, as it has aged over time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> The Moleskine note book, as we know it today is, however, in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to bring a distinguiertes design note book on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, technical adviser at the time of the company, is charged with market introduction of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The note book was a traditional production technology, called jetty start (mole skin), which described a Baumwollack, which will be used for salaries of padded benches. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of note book was asked by writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten subject again, until the 20th century was seen as an icon of would-be artists,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi, now brands responsible for Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success comes. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010 increased sales by 26% and establish a sales of 12.7 million. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> This is a far cry from the usual production in the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine the Italian border, and in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyer, since the notice book as businessmen as enthusiastic students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Moleskine the image cosmopolitan, cultured and offengeistiger customers. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian companies, which had its beginnings in 12, and today employs over 100 employees and has since 2008 on two offices, one in Milan, the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutique in city centres and goes to assert its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have followed the spirit and his new printing needs, despite the recovery of the e-mails,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand exposure called &quot;Detour (a) &quot; launched, in the architects and artists their own notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, the company at the film festival in Locarno also cover with leopard pattern on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and showed it to diversify its products: pockets, diary, pen, computer boxes... The brand has the full range of articles. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success, the begrudgers in the plan: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo by the investment fund bought SG Capital Europe, today&apos;s Syntegra Capital, and proposed a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people to such a high level? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today marks the beginning of the 15th week of work for the disabled. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite the purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people always twice the average average: 19% to 9% of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, stressed Éric Blanc Franchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, the&quot; week of work for disabled people .&quot; &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The within fifteen years are considerable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;That was not the unemployment rate twice, but three times as high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed are still many obstacles remain before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students with higher levels of educational attainment. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% in the overall average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working, and the &quot;form the core of the problem,&quot; says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much for the factual brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> The underlying implication that mentalities, certainly, but slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A in April by IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have &quot;a weak level of disability,&quot; the &quot;over-represented&quot; &quot;persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually well-off.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latter, which dates from 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now about 3%,&quot; said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked to collect contributions from companies that flout the law. </seg>
