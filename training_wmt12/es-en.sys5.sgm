<seg id="1"> The parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Parliament of Ukraine has refused today the proposal of repealing the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code in which the leader of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko is condemned. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The modification would open the doors to the release from prison of the exprimer minister, but the members of parliament rejected the proposal of reducing the sentences for economic crimes in the second reading. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison for the supposed firm of a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The sentence yet is not firm, the court of advocation has the duty to revise it in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymoshenko appeared convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in west doubts have risen up on the impartiality of the court. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The proposal that the paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which he tormented himself was withdrawn to the ex first minister was supported for 147 representatives in the poll. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For its approval 226 votes were required. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The victory of Libya </seg>
<seg id="10"> The history of the Libyan release, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar the-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the one deserted and without it already there is not war. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It remains because it defines who is the winner </seg>
<seg id="13"> As it is already a habit in the region, the Islamists won the choices, but it is now a matter of elucidating if they are moderate or radical </seg>
<seg id="14"> The transitional National Board has made come into effect the traditional law, the sharía, that in a certain way we already know. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya will become a country without delinquency, because the hand will be cut for the thieves. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The women can already keep forgetting to be emancipated and the apostates waiting for its execution and like this successively. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of for the person of the dictator, the society, composed of warlike tribes, he will join for the Koran. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Libya an order that we can ourselves not even will be established to imagine and that certainly we can not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, our living is not even the only one even objectively the best and, probably, the already mentioned Libyans did not need, however. </seg>
<seg id="20"> What is true is that it does not stop surprising that the Islamic combatants accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs thankful. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only justification was that, from its point of view, the attacks of the NATO did not direct them an American, but big general or Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When winners in Libya are looked for, west is not among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We are caught in a firing that the Islamists make use of and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without there being accountabilities of obtaining profits. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this case, expelling the ones &quot;crossed&quot; does not mean a problem to the sites </seg>
<seg id="26"> But, without occupation, will the oil industries manage to get hold of the Libyan black gold alone with good words? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is quite possible than, but can be that finally west can boast about protecting the human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As long as the followers of the sharía are not crossed us. </seg>

<seg id="77"> Daily menu of an obese child: he does not have for breakfast and dines on sausages </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than one third of the children with ages comprised among the 9 of them and 13 years have problems of overweight, where the overweight affects 9% of the school population and the obesity at 5%. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The obese children come in the main from families with a way of life that is not healthy, as it transpires from current researches. </seg>
<seg id="80"> It is proved which is the importance of the atmosphere where people grow for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models who act as reference again. </seg>
<seg id="81"> In the table, the obsessed children feed, for example, on sausages at least with the double of frequency that the children of families with normal peso. </seg>
<seg id="82"> To dine, of 19% of the obese ones fried potatoes had dined on the day more before the analysis, which is linked to the program of prevention &quot;The obesity is not a chance&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of children with overweight there is not habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where alone 15% of the children answered that at least its fathers, per week, find time once for the physical exercise. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Enquiry carried out to 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The enquiry was carried out at the end of the last school year and almost 900 children of Basic Education of all Czech Republic took part in it. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was already the second edition of the program of &quot;The obesity of is not a chance&quot;, which supports the Company of General Sanitary Insurance and the company Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Until now, they have taken part in the project more than 12 a thousand children from the 4th up to the 8th course. </seg>
<seg id="88"> An adequate diet and quite a lot of exercise in family are determining factors, which they make decrease the number of children with overweight and even obesity notably. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Alone half of the interviewed children have answered that they have five daily foods according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, afternoon snack and dinner, that is one of the basic conditions&quot; &quot;for a healthy diet&quot;, comprises one of the results of the enquiry. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast but with sausage to dine </seg>
<seg id="91"> The specialists warn that, in a healthy development, they are important, besides, to the details, which also have, as for example to have a fixed hour for the breakfast in family. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In Czech Republic, however, alone 23% of the families of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same hour. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most of the families, each has breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> But the worst thing was to discover that by 10% of the homes it is not had for breakfast at all. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is, however, the base of a correct daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The study shows that in the families of obese children the insane fried potatoes are consumed with much more frequency. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost all - independently of the peso - drink sweet cool drinks (70%) to journal. </seg>
<seg id="98"> For general norm they do sport more of 40% of the children interviewed, however, you enter its fathers this result is reduced without the half, alone 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Fabricate yourself your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> The following phase of the study it made it possible that its own diets were created by the lads chosen (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) from all the possible offers according to its tastes and opinions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The food preferences of the Czech children in ages comprised between the 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy feeding, are very far from what is ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among its favorite foods they find the paste, the meat and the candies </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The popularity of the sweet cool drinks&quot; &quot;is especially alarming&quot;, is warned in the final report of the study. </seg>
<seg id="104"> As main food takes the paste the palm and the meat of bird follows him from near. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Practically, the children always refuse the legume and the taste for the fish and the vegetable is very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Change to healthy habits </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the study shows that the children are ready to change its food habits if they receive the just information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the group of control of the participants in the study, which filled the questionnaire in after finishing the program of prevention The obesity is not a chance, it was given in many cases an important change in favor of the beginnings of a healthy feeding&quot;, is noted in the results of the study. </seg>
<seg id="109"> What is relative catches the attention of the sweet cool drinks, for example, where many children would start to prefer the normal and ordinary water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children would also choose the meat of bird and the fish for the main food with more frequency in the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the derivatives from flour. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The designer has to be also a good psychologist, sustain the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article, Cómo learn the designers, I already complained a little of which the initial lessons already were quite full. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It did not have nor plans of how that would go. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Conferences of three professionals of the bouquet, how to dress to problematic characters and, besides, a seminar about how it works in the show business. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> As much as nearer they are the final examinations, more information and practical tasks await us </seg>
<seg id="117"> And although every Saturday and Sunday are developed by the course, a pin does not fit any longer. </seg>
<seg id="118"> We are time we have studied with the manageress, Alena, (in the course there is not any man) about how to dress the woman that does not have a perfect symmetry. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And like this it is the great majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Somebody is cuellicorto, somebody has a figure stylized without the adequate curves and somebody suffers overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The designer has to know how to soften some wide shoulders optically, to stretch a collar or to recreate the necessary curves </seg>
<seg id="122"> They have given us certain tricks about how to do to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of breasts and enormous hips but narrow waist and not to dress it at the same time in a too challenging way </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or the trousers are not adapted, it is worth to be done to sew at least a bit of extra cloth to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Undoubtedly they will not repent, because the clothes that he feels perfectly are unpayable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> With a skirt to measure it will feel much better than with one that not for of being moved, to be lifted, dances in the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Dressing clothes with folds, ornaments, embroideries or drapings can be allowed by the stylized body. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are many types of different information and of bodies certainly, so I am happy that I have all the week to put order in my head all this information. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And even like this, I fear that with the assigned task, I already have more than in excess. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Every participant in the course has been assigned to him two famous, to, those that will have to design two wardrobes: one for the day and another for the night. </seg>
<seg id="130"> The current aspect, the style of fashion that adapts to the person in question, has to be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="131"> It has been me due &quot;to dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know it of the campaign of Victoria&apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Shout inside, for me is much better that, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have fattened about a hundred kilos (please, they take the exaggeration into account), or the very young one Selena Gómez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The dresses have that to cut them of the magazines or to search them in internet and to print them, for afterwards to elaborate them graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The moodboard, who is as it is called to the complete result, expresses besides our personal style and our relation with the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is important also to think in the graphic part of the fashion design. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Therefore, the designer does not dress alone physically, but he also is in charge of the pages of products, for example, in the magazines (of specific subjects, as trends, bags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Of everything he spoke the designer and designer Mario Kameník for us. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But all this already remains for Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The designer has to have a global vision. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The three specialistic guests cheered the conference of Saturday up with information on every type of bodies. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The designer Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the photographer of fashion Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub remembered us that the fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how for this to profit. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a good designer knows how to work with a same garment of different forms. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is, in this case, basic. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Thus, the such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to what is classic with cowboys and T-shirt, but it is also used for dressing the bare body with court shoes and photographing it as if it were in fact a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or else it is enough to tuck it up and to raise the collar to obtain a totally different image. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play with that&quot;, insisted to us. </seg>
<seg id="148"> What I value more is the following board: &quot;To start to work, it is necessary that first you know all the rules&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Afterwards you can already break them&quot;, said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> At last it remains me clear why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if afterwards it works out that in the magazines of fashion we find different results. </seg>
<seg id="151"> That without talking about the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a designer has to have more types of clothes in the reservation of that which he intends to photograph. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Thus, for a history of fashion that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), fifteen has to be had prepared, ready-to-use, at least. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different to those that are used in the reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> All that has to be taken it into account at the time of designing the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and the style mean they alone, in many cases, half of the success. </seg>
<seg id="157"> It is enough to look to Madonna, which is not precisely an extraordinary singer, but the image and the márquetin have acted as it a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Czech Republic, there is for the moment not a clear trend to use the services of the designers yet. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are me enough, my physical aspect is not important so many). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And when somebody asks us for our services, it has to be taken into account that it is very probable that they indicate a very different cutting to his real (smaller) to us. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Afterwards alone remains guglear and to find out whether the gossip magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/been slimming, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted us in that it is not it enough for the designer to be orientated in the fashion, but has to know about outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> During its work, it must especially communicate with the people that it dresses, therefore it is basic to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> It knows how to value the people, is not acted as less, defends its opinions. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a manageress hires you so that you classify the wardrobe for him and complete it for him with pretty garments, you can not catch and throw all what there was and say: &quot;huy what horror&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Find at least a couple of things that you can ponder and recommend so that somebody can put them to himself&quot;, says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It himself also showed us that everything must fit in the call &quot;placovka&quot;, that is, the labor exchange. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are had there. </seg>
<seg id="169"> They are objects as scissors, as scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There is also thread of nailon (that it serves it such to the designer during the session of photos of products that bags or caps), special tweezers of hook of garments in front, if this were bigger (the pins and another type of hooks are not allowed, for they could damage the fabric), or a game of seam. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Not to stay in the passive listening and to put something into practice, we have learned to line the sole of the shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more still the exterior. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And we did not make more to line and to line. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We could not touch the shoes with the scissors not to damage them by accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So it had to be very skilful. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has given me a joy when praising my work without reservations. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The truth is that those skills are not given to me very well. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is alone a small part of everything those that we have listened to during all the weekend, in the second part of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I have already realized that dedicating me to the fashion design at professional level is not a path of rose, but what the people say makes exactly no difference for me. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed: The Run is competed through all America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> A journey, in principle disregarded, gets complicated because of a series of oversights unbecoming to a routine journey during the turn of morning. </seg>
<seg id="182"> In a certain measure it was managed to cover the expectations, but that does not act as anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to make anything extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new delivery, to which The Run is added to the bond, aroused great expectations already before its debut. </seg>
<seg id="184"> For Speed promised that saga of careers Need would give new airs in the old-fashioned way and, as a result of has been shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being again a gender of action simply. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We also feel curious because he knows how the scenes inserted, where the main character goes down from the car and walks for its own foot, would remain. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As it usually happens in the series of NFS, the results do not vary big thing with regard to what we waited for each other. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are careers that can occur for acceptable, but in the total counting points are lost because of absurd failures, which already come appearing in the series since years ago. </seg>
<seg id="188"> In fact they are not been able even to name errors, but it is rather about the incomprehensible unwillingness of the programmers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure starts very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are introduced in a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, it is offered to take part in an illegal career through all America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit to the steering wheel in the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive the first to New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is to offer something interesting. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route divides in ten stages and, afterwards, in more than fifty careers. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It is deduced from that that every career takes place for a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> That way, one does not have even remotely the sensation that the game always offers the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the environments are even nice in sight, although the technical level of the diagram is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore, it is not anything of the other world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the avenue through the desert, the fall landscape or the high mountains covered of snow cause a very nice visual effect. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Besides, the careers diversify from time to time for an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> For example, thus in the desert you find a storm of sand that decreases the visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, in the mountains people have to be careful so that an avalanche does not bury you. </seg>
<seg id="202"> According to that, each of the careers is very well developed. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Alone there is a couple of models, but with that coarse. </seg>
<seg id="204"> During a moment, you try to advance to a quantity of competitors required (what is normal in a classic career), you try afterwards to gain time (timed classic duel) and it waits for you for a duel afterwards against a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In the middle of all this the police appears sometimes, that it does not do but still to obstruct the things more. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty are the landscapes out of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Animations are presented interactive when Jack, in most of the cases, has to escape of somebody and you have to help it, always pressing the button exactly in the moment exactly. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising, however, that there are quite a lot of less landscapes in the game of what one might wait (specifically there is alone three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> But the final result is positive, because this element does not get to be troublesome and, in the already mentioned context, it is one of the elements that make the game be more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of conduction follows the marks of the previous episodes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That means that at day of today it is not a big thing any longer, but it can not be stated that it is bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you look for a realistic simulation, you can already search in another part. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But a career conceived with quite a lot of action needs this style of conduction quite a lot, although we will be able to find something better among the games of the competence. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Up to here, everything in order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems arise after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike what is correct of the models of conduction, the same with the collisions does not happen any longer. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Of games of this type one may not expect it to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a knock against any object, you can not predict how your writ will react, with what not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> It is typical that, when doing a very adjusted advance or to circulate the writ with a normal traffic, so alone there is slight rubs, but in other almost identical situations, your writ ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> O even finishes totally destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system of reseteo, great problems do not arise, but it can make you of bad humor. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The reseteos are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or te salts of the track, the game returns you to the last point of ransom in the track. </seg>
<seg id="223"> However, in every career alone is had of five available reseteos. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If you consume all of them, you have to resume the career from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So it is not more than a help in the event of something not going well is, but it is not very trustworthy. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, not even the reseteo helps, alone help being learned the stage given by heart. </seg>
<seg id="227"> A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some curves, for example, have to be entered in a specific way; in another way, they are impossible to take. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Other times you always find in some place &quot;civil&quot; vehicles with the same configuration, even if the first are, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This does of raging especially in situations, when you see that two writs that go to the meeting in opposed addresses, your opponent advances troublefree, but when you arrive, must turn or else to stop. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is in the same way when you arrive, because it is programmed for the &quot;surprise&quot; always happening in front of your noses. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have besides one more advantage. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During all the departure you will arrive to places where, without taking the moment into account, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Besides this happens at the end of the departure, in a long bridge, which is still more startling. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Your opponent must arrive before you, to the price that is. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it goes in front of you, it obstructs you the vision of the writs that come head-on, so at first you can do baby food the car. </seg>
<seg id="237"> The idea about creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenalin can be understood, but the execution is so visible that it probably disappoints you immediately. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And is a sentence, because even if the model of the journey is simple, the game is amused and with action, so that often it is not possible to follow in a retail way what happens not even where. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And really it makes no difference, if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the career so that there is not the boredom, or any other thing. </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the change of writs during the careers. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You have to be attentive to the petrol pumps next to the road, because precisely there you have to change writ, although in the great majority of the cases what you have will be enough for you. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The writs divide into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sport ones are adapted for urban zones, the American strong writs for the straight highways and the exotic supersport ones for a technical conduction, for example, for mountain roads with curves. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Besides main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are careers in specific places that you will know for the histories. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here you will obtain not alone medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which is used as much for the challenges as the stories. </seg>
<seg id="246"> As it reaches the superior level, the driver is opened by several possibilities to him, starting for the writ and finishing with backgrounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> At the same time, there is an online function Autolog connected, that it compares your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other community functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> It is one of the elements most difficult to understand how it is the last career done in the history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> With the car you arrive up to the tunnel of the meter (happen), where you start to run in the dark for the ways (happen). </seg>
<seg id="250"> The speedometer marks between 150 and 200 km/hr (pass) for you and, suddenly, at the back the convoy of the meter arrives you and it takes you in front simply. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In the writing we will probably have a discussion on this during several days, about if during the programming of the game none thinking at least a little or if the real authors taking us for a panda of silly. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical part of the game is not at all extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects work out in most of the nice cases, sometimes up to arrogant ones. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Then what sentence that, in the most tense moments the quality of image and, on occasions, in a severe way comes down. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This affects especially the accidents where there is many participants involved, when the quality of continuous image any longer is not valid. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The audio one is well and the soundtrack is a question of tastes. </seg>
<seg id="256"> So that it is of the liking to most of the young group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each of its father and of its mother&quot;, but it can be meant that nobody would buy the game alone for its music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is then quite confusing. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game avoided absolutely foolish errors, we would have ourselves problems in stating that The Run is the best game of NFS of the last years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> It gives the sensation that the game is not concluded. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The amusement is guaranteed, but prepare because the errors will hit you in the eyes with the force of some reflectors of airport. </seg>
<seg id="261"> The choruses of the University Carolina will take part in the concert &quot;Students of Velvet&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="276"> The ambassadress before the EU, Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation of negativistas and Euro-skeptic. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The treaty of Lisbon has affected significantly the balance between the individual institutions&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;He did not expect for me to be assembled a merciless war&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will last five, six years, before the situation is stabilized a little, it is soothed and the new players are gotten used to its new papers&quot;, like this started with conviction its conference in the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassadress before the EU, Milena Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How not to take seriously its &quot;white&quot; motto &quot;and&quot; that &quot;openly on Europe&quot;, it said in the first part of its conference, when it managed to describe every organ of the EU and its relations with such an accuracy and clarity, then would already be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the OR. Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Vicenová also pondered the work of of the new permanent president of the European Board, Herman go Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;The first thing rise the criticisms, that if, a grey civil servant, capable of assuming any role, is vapid, but have to say that it left to all confused, because it assumes its roles to the perfection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="284"> It &quot;is a man that knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, to be communicated with them and that it has a very clear vision of where the EU must go&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new post of representative of the Foreign Policy and Safety is explained from the question: &quot;Who is this EU? To which number I can call it?&quot;. They are then an important crossing towards the unification and the clarification of of the political union of face to States as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to forbid us the cheese of Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová has been in charge also of the agenda followed, follows and will follow the Board European in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs were in charge of the emergent economic crisis, solved the crisis of the gas and organized a summit for the Oriental Association. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government in that moment was identified as a very negative aspect, which affected seriously Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU has many appointments for the moment. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In words of the ambassadress: &quot;a good racket&quot;, not alone the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being treated now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated, has to be approved. </seg>
<seg id="294"> If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive bigger support and which less? That is something that will be present in the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassadress remembered also its main mottos, with which it arrived to Europe: &quot;About Europe with clarity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;What is true is that I do not like the ugly abbreviations, the foreign expressions or the jargons that the people&quot; do not &quot;understand&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;How can understand a citizen that in Brussels are not invented real the cucumbers the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes or that anybody is not going to forbid us the cheese of Olomouc?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="298"> He also intends to benefit from the atmosphere of the EU more and to bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> The Europe of the speeds waits for us </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the ambassadress, the Czechs have fame of Euro-skeptic and the people rather perceive the negative aspects that the positive ones. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Besides, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is of crowd of factors, as the modesty of our candidates, its inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Besides the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the force and the collaboration of the Group of Visegrad. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Think for me that when a Pole and a Hungarian go to me and a Slovak approaches me, a French at my side tells to me: &quot;What, those of the Group of Visegrad, have already remained?&quot;, and it is seen that it does not do any grace to him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="305"> In the future, new very hard norms of budgetary policy await the EU, according to Vicenová, for the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It is perceived as something very real of the concept of both speeds, if they are not more, in Europe, more than the new one of &quot;the European Federation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the Euro-Area and countries out of the Euro-Area&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the space Schengen and have besides the procedure of reinforced cooperation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;It was said by first time that alone cooperate the countries that want and the that, not that they stay outside&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;These procedures will be every time more and they will reinforce the Europe of both speeds&quot;, Vicenová is waited. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this sense, it also highlighted the paper of Czech Republic and of Herman Rompuy go not alone from the Euro-Area in the application of the beginning, according to which all the subjects that affect the whole of the EU must struggle between the member states, among the members. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovator IBM initiates its second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If somebody looked for a term that defined the strategy of IBM with great accuracy, the most approximate would be &quot;a long deadline&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and have, however, already gone by a hundred years from its foundation. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The base of this largoplacista character put it the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson men. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He already minted the motto that many problems of the world have solution if the people are ready to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its motto &quot;Think!&quot; it converted in its seal, about which the life of the gigantic future (it was also the bond of an internal magazine that IBM started to publish in 1935) will keep being built. </seg>
<seg id="319"> Watson was besides the base of a carefully lifted corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous motion towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it was maintained faithful to its basic beginnings, but without fearing to the changes around. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That us, during our first century, has allowed to transform the technology, the business and the society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We expect still to prosper more in our second century&quot;, stated during its anniversary, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, already in the thirties saw to the care of its employees as the businessman of Baťa in Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were of the first American workers that had holidays with pay, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that awarded the best inventors and vendors. </seg>
<seg id="326"> IBM holds the same long-term sophistication in the relation with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company already from the beginning knew how to discover talents (when being one of the first world companies in finishing with any type of discrimination, could choose troublefree). </seg>
<seg id="328"> In the line of the antidiscrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which it will replace next year Palmisano: Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She has already been working thirty years in IBM, where he has been a head of sales, márquetin and strategies. </seg>
<seg id="330"> During the last years IBM has shared the called virtual meetings, rain of online ideas, from which infinity of future strategies and innovations rise up. </seg>
<seg id="331"> One may not it surprise ideas that they are in excess, for in the firm almost half a million of people work. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, IBM maintained one more concept of institution that corporate technological&quot;, the economist states professor of the Harvard Business School and authoress of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve problems of businesses for users of the technology&quot;, points out George Colony of the consultant Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself says there is a difference among entering the business and creating a business directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;Big Green&quot; - as it knows it to himself in the US. familiarly because of its logo, companies of the world has been converted in the last hundred years in one of the biggest. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The technological company is possibly more versatile (web accommodation in a wide range of services develops equipments as programs, infrastructures and services so much, that they go from servants up to nanotechnology). </seg>
<seg id="339"> He exhibits the biggest number of patents of all the North American technological companies and five of its employees have received the prize Nobel. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its inventions they find the automatic teller, the cards of payment, the financial exchanges, the bar codes and the diskettes. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM will bill this 220 a billion dollars. This year it has converted in the second technological firm for capitalization of market (the first is Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking per future </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all the products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of the customers and the moment (IBM did not bet PCjr for its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or IBM computers). </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If its business is based on advancing, it can not be anchored emotionally in the past&quot;, recognized Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> That&apos;s why, IBM does not have problems in building its bases in other platforms (and equally, if they do not work, abandons them). </seg>
<seg id="346"> And that the difference of the competence, Microsoft, that basically is maintained and always falls exclusively with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Technology of future </seg>
<seg id="348"> In question of sales, IBM is dedicated especially to services, of which approximately one fifth part are of programs and another fifth of equipments. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With everything, still in 1990 the equipments represented more of half of the fee of the suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From 2000, IBM has sold a billion dollars of low yield for a total value of 15 active. During in the same period, has inverted 58 a billion dollars in the purchase of technology of future. </seg>
<seg id="351"> The inversions have followed from 2008, when for the first time the modern financial world crisis appeared. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM acts according to the premises of its first head, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29 increased the inversions. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It seems that until now the IBM company has known how to dodge the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the actions of IBM from the beginning of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to one 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The exchange of IBM is all to change it, except its value. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Then, it can be waited for that when it takes revenge the following crisis, this flexible giant will last. </seg>
<seg id="357"> History of IBM: from the cutter of cheeses up to the space flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> The IBM company (International Business Machines) was founded on New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The IBM name is already adopted in 1924 - it was originally treated of a brand used in the branch offices of Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The base that gave rise to the birth of IBM rises up from the merge of four companies that soar to the decade of 1880. </seg>
<seg id="361"> It had inventions as the famous &quot;time clock&quot;, which allows controlling the entry and exit of the employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who up to 1930 also presided over its supervisor board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint registered the head of a company of the competence, Thomas J. Watson, so that it helped it with the management of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The founder of IBM (the ideas about Watson keep being the firm base on which the corporate culture and identity are sustained) was eclipsed by the new leader. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson managed the company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as it indicates its name, started with the production and sale of every type of devices for businesses, from cutters of meat and cheese up to cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the four first years that Watson managed the company, the invoicing doubled in 9 million dollars and started the great expansion of the company through the continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so crucial for the company that, almost after forty years occupying the chair of the head, was replaced by its son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under its address, IBM started to work in the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the sixties the staff and the computers of IBM helped to the NASA to guide the flights to the space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon). </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM series System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classic &quot;pecés&quot;, which established the standard of computers of that time, arrived to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years afterwards, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, on its part, acquired the part of consultancy of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started to offer a complete advice and services of high markup. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that has paid IBM these three last years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is, &quot;a more intelligent planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its goal is to do a more rational use of the technology, although the areas have not been planned yet nor the circumstances have been improved, for example, as for the transport and the administration of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> For the sector of the trade, IBM presented not long ago the platform &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; that allows the retailers to manage the complete commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a long history in this country. </seg>
<seg id="378"> It already in 1932 opened a branch office in the Czechoslovakia of then, the first country that had it in the Central Europe and Oriental. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today here, the IBM ČR operates besides on the strategic center of externalización in Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The headquarters for Central Europe and Oriental has is in Prague. Also here there is an equipment of research of world fame that he works with the recognition of voice. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Rychtářová about its unfaithful husband: </seg>
<seg id="382"> Keep, Iveta, to that donkey, which any longer I do not want it! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtářová (53) said it ran out! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After its lover had been converted by its husband Josef Rychtář (53) in the only protector of Iveta Bartosová (45), but also, Darina kept having the expectation that Josef woke up of its pink dream and it would return home. </seg>
<seg id="385"> However he is not going to wait any longer and has established clear rules for the life in the future. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &quot;Pepe can return home, but already not as my couple&quot;, explained Rychtářová. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Darina Rychtářová received during the summer Bartosové in its home, he could not even imagine how it would finish its marriage. </seg>
<seg id="388"> In spite of the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not give up the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Even he declared publicly that he loved it. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With time, Darina resigned itself, in an apparent way it accepted the relation of its husband and he even said goodbye to it forever. </seg>
<seg id="391"> It is not important to Rychytář with whom its woman lies down. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If a day Rychtář broke up with Bartosová, its woman would not wait at home for it with the open arms. </seg>
<seg id="393"> He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of its life in our home, nobody will &quot;throw&quot; it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;But here it would not already live as my darling and borrico old man that was mistaken, but as a man&quot; that &quot;certain links unite me&quot; to, said Rychtářová and added that it had already been unhooked its husband and it insisted only on the mutual respect. </seg>
<seg id="395"> To Josef until now it does not import it that itself woman has closed it the door behind. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &quot;I accept the decision of my woman&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;I will be with Iveta and there is not possible change&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;My woman established this as a marriage on the paper and I respect it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="399"> &quot;The company follows in force, I do the hotfixes of home, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the purchases&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="400"> &quot;Darina and I talk ourselves with normality, the only thing is that we do not share bed, said Rychtář. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;We do not sleep joint and it is not me interesting, neither where it goes nor if it has some boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I already know that it is fault of mine, fell in love with Iveta and assume all the responsibility&quot;, concludes Josef. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices of the women: Do they also refer to you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men to be capable of mentioning some typical vices of the women, each of them will in general name them without thinking. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Women wanted, do you recognize each other in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are mentioned, that they manage to make the males boil the blood? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Going from purchases </seg>
<seg id="408"> Does he reproach its orange average that it has for dependence from the purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Does he have to buy itself a trapito at least in week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Does it like often to buy in the lowerings? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then in its case it can be said that to go of purchases it has been converted in a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women realize that they should calm its passion for the purchases, at least a little. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But to see, which woman could resist the temptation to walk simply through the stores of clothes, to look for well adjusted garments and afterwards to prove them to himself all in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Although for most of the women to go from purchases is a pastime, for the men it can convert practically in a hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Alone remembers how many times it has already said it at its couple that better waits it in front of the door. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too fat?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;It would need to be slimming at least five kilos - it should start to do exercise?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;Real taste te?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Are these sentences not familiar to him? </seg>
<seg id="421"> To which yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Then she is one of those women obsessed for its aspect. </seg>
<seg id="423"> It is not that you must stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hear its couple to complain all the time of its physical aspect. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The strong sex also agrees in that as much as more it increases the frequency of the complaints, more troublesome are returned the women. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The order and the cleaning in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is as an infinite roundabout. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Cleaning the windows, to pass the vacuum cleaner, to scrub the ground, to remove the dust, to scrub the bath and all that at least twice per week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Does he reproach it for its couple that has trod it the clean ground with a dirty foot, to its children who have dirtied a newly cleaned toilet and a shelf with doors of glass that so much cost it to clean? </seg>
<seg id="429"> If you suffer this &quot;deviation&quot;, it tries to be conscious that nothing should be exaggerated and that the order and the cleaning should probably not occupy to be fundamental in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This inoffensive desire for cleaning could threaten its relations and the familiar welfare. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Doing unpleasant comments </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;The used underpants are left with the dirty clothes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You want to put on also tomorrow those used socks&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;The wet rag is not left in the ground!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If it does those cometary at its couple more times at the day, it knows that like this will obtain to take it out of its boxes. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Naturally. You do not mean at all bad, alone wants to get everything to be in order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps, if the men knew this, the women, for its part, would not do so many comments. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Calumnies and gossips </seg>
<seg id="439"> To some women also the calumnies, the gossips, go them but also the offenses and the conspiracy against somebody. </seg>
<seg id="440"> The women are concentrated in the relations, that&apos;s why they like to talk joint of things of the type who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Maybe to each of us it sometimes lets slip a small and inoffensive gossip. </seg>
<seg id="442"> With the hand in the heart, this is characteristic almost of all the women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> On the other hand, there are gossiping women of those that are not controlled, which they love their gossiping and they often make it, they despise all of them and they are dangerous for those that surround them, especially in a feminine work equipment. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jágr and Voráček helped with its assistances beat the Philadelphia </seg>
<seg id="445"> The front one of hockey Jaromír Jágr shared on Monday in the meeting NHL with two assistances that brought the victory on the Philadelphia 5:3 in the court of Carolina and puts the Czech players again in the vanguard of the competition. </seg>
<seg id="446"> In both cases Claude Giroux made use of the move of the star of 39 years, and gave one more crossing and was declared better player of the match. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Two assistances in the match and also the colleague of Jágr, Jakub Voráček, were granted. </seg>
<seg id="448"> After the meeting, Jágr stated before the journalists of overseas that Giroux had predicted a big night. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;Already before the match it had said it that it would make triplet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;He felt it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes they seem ambushed&quot;, explained Jágr, after its performance gave a goal to Giroux, as a result of the first lash of the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A while also the second intervention of the equipment had a Czech trace afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voráček got hold of the disk at the back of the goal of the Hurricanes and moved it among the circles up to Maxim Talbot, who put goal. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part already they dominated the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Precisely for Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> After collaborating with Jágr he put the third goal, after its shot slipped in through the quarter of the goal of Wayne Simmonds. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love my playing with it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I do not mean that it is the best player of the court, but it is undoubtedly among the three best&quot;, pondered Jágr to its headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;It would never have happened to me that at the end of my career he was going to play with a sportsman as it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am very satisfied of that&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play for it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="462"> All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now causes results&quot;, adds Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina still converted the match in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and afterwards of new one of Dwyer, of penalty, until it put of distance to a goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read did not allow more complications, although they finished surpassed in number of two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Pronger had a good performance in our field&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;It cleared the disk, I took speed and Read went towards the furthest part&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to hit to the disk upon it and I am happy because I obtained it&quot;, Voráček described the last goal of the match as it lived it. </seg>
<seg id="468"> With its victory, Philadelphia has set in the lead of the East Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play up to the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third it retired for an injury in the top of the body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Canadiens not alone lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomás Plekanec did not know how to make use of one of the shots. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More that the points lost to the local coach regretted the great quantity of injured in the last rank, and the match alone with five defenses to play. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;That is bad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We play the match alone with a veteran player, the rest was new&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;In end, but is that against that it can not be done at all, we have to fight with that&quot;, said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;So much to rotate to the players was returned against us, we could not withstand it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We more still had to simplify the game, to take the disk of our field.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> &quot;And like this we leave hollow&quot;, explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The goals of Jets were scored by five players who put like this an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five matches. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have the prices of the journeys evolved since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Up to 1989 there were five authorized state travel agencies in the Czechoslovakia of then alone: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agencies of that moment sold in most of the journey cases alone to the socialist block, for the journeys to west were very restricted. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists went, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the RDA (East Germany), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A positive exception was the comprised period between 1962 and 1972, when people could travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslavian regime inclined afterwards towards the west and the journeys of the Czech tourists were then quite a lot restricted. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of the socialism was the fact that to the citizens of the socialist block (that is, also to the Checoeslovacos) was not allowed them to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, needed a card of invitation, if not, the individual journey was not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The agencies of journey offered in those times also journeys in the West, but one had to be put to the queue with a sleeping bag and to spend like this all the night, or to have &quot;good acquaintances&quot; in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Still like this not everything was gained. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The called &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for the journeys in the West, was not granted to the &quot;politically little reliable people&quot;, that like this could not travel not at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak coin was not a freely convertible coin and, without accountability of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the occidental coin) to travel to west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The big majority of the Czechs spent its holidays in its own country, therefore there was a great number of huts and homes of summer, which the Czechs acquired. This habit still persists. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The mode of traveling from the Czechs has suffered since 1989 an authentic revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Whereas up to 1989 for us it was the not goes more to pass the holidays in RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs did 4.5 million journeys of holidays to countries of all the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Is nna great paradox, of which nowadays any longer we are not conscious, the fact that to the favorite destination at present, Croatia, up to 1989 could not be traveled freely, because was part of the Yugoslavia of then. </seg>
<seg id="496"> At the beginning of the nineties the occidental discharge from visas to travel to the adjacent States of Europe imposed itself, which provoked an enormous wave of visits of short duration, overcoat to Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The checoeslovacos, for much time, were not seen full of the excursions in the West, all the world wanted to see it to the the less for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs in the parks in tents slept, since our admissions of then did not allow us to pay a hotel or guesthouse. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was the to take the food (preserves, sausages, etc.) with themselves to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, like this our tourists could finally, after decades, to buy occidental coin freely. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living increased and with it also the average salaries, what about 1997 provoked an increase in the demand for journeys. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With the increase of the demand for journeys they started the agencies, from 1997 with regularity, to prepare the journeys using the connections of charter flights, which did to bring incredibly the prices of the journeys down in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility to obtain discounts for the volume of passengers. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 90 of the last century, the Czechs already traveled without visa almost to all the developed countries, except US., which still simplified more ours journeys. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolutionary tourism it already happened in the 2000, when it was organized, thanks to an enormous demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> From that year, break up all the years direct charter flights with Czech tourists did distant and hot countries. This winter it will already be blown up directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> The exotic countries visit them at present nearly 100 a thousand Czechs per year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment of this period, which it symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, it arrived in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 of November 2008, US. eliminated the visas for the Czech tourists, with what our country passed to be among the countries most developed of the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in its history, have passed more of half of its holidays abroad (50.3%) and by first time in its history, have been used up in journeys abroad more than 15 a thousand Czech crowns for head, including the expenses in the place of stay. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Ordinary General Assembly called for to choose the president, who could finish again in neutral gear. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Since almost five months ago the Czech soccer is without president and it is probable that the successor of Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR), will not know himself even after the call of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> In fact, people have not arrived to an agreement on the rules of poll to continue yet. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without them, it will not be able to be voted at least to choose among the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> The ones shown interest to preside over the Czech soccer are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hasek renounced its charge in June not without before to call for its colleagues in order to find a strong person that knew how to be in charge of the soccer in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> However, after concluding the era Hasek, a controversy between the two federations of the association incapable of arriving to an agreement to choose a common candidate broke out. </seg>
<seg id="517"> That remained in evidence on 16 of September when the new president had to be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the General Assembly were brought together in vain in the National Home (Národní dům), praguense of Smíchov situated in the neighborhood, because the conversations had been blocked and not alone as for the method of choice. </seg>
<seg id="519"> It was not arrived to any consensus not even as for whom in the General Assembly it had right to voting - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> From that moment and due to this only point, a partial agreement, backed up also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation for full powers is not possible, took place. </seg>
<seg id="521"> However, the disputes about the electoral code are still open. </seg>
<seg id="522"> More light on the situation any longer could not throw even the Executive Committee that, in its, ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not solve nothing. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The opinion on the possibility to vote has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point keeps being it. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is the following one: which way to proceed in the third round to prevent the neutral gear? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute turns around to if it must be proceeded according to the statues or find &quot;another model&quot;, says Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, that, from the address of the association, represents the professional futbol. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the model suggested in the statues, in the third round that candidate will win who has bigger percentage of support in the federation to which he will present its candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The Region of Moravia is ready to arrive to an appointment so that that candidate can win with a bigger total percentage of votes in both federations. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these porcentuales calculations, must have the majority of at least two thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;This would remove it, however, the meaning to the two previous rounds and would refuse completely the concept of bicameral system&quot;, like this is as Svoboda understands the objections of the morava part, according to what the best thing would be not to touch the order and to vote according to the applicable statues. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With has been said, surprisingly, agrees also Tomas Paclík, although it is meant that Pelta needs more the electoral regulation established by the statues of all the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I would like it to be voted to the utmost according to the statues&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So that they do not invent any silly thing about the representatives as in the last General Assembly&quot;, it says the owner of Victoria Plzen, which is postulated for the first time as candidate and which mainly directs its observations against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta keeps being optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to it, in Nymburk he will decide on the new president and it thinks that the candidates in the future cooperated constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passions will be calmed with the match of today of our national equipment in the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;The soccer will be again a protagonist, and like this was cooperated more at ease&quot; states the representative of the Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in management of the soccer, so much at professional level as regional. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is the most reticent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I expect it to be arrived to an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> It &quot;is not about the conflict between Bohemians and moravos, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to its own convenience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This can have as consequence a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;Anyway, I wait that the common sense will be imposed&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> It does not remain any longer much time so that all the parts arrive to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations had to be carried out in Montenegro, but who can know the match until it starts if the equipment of soccer will be complete? </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special airplane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among another the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not gone out this morning for technical problems in Prague, an alternative having to be looked for to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the match of classification will take place. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Quizas the decisive meeting, at last, it could be the one that will take place at governmental level, which, as they have, will be celebrated this Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobes, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like a lot to incorporate the parts divided up to the most powerful sport organization of the country so that people arrive to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot in game: the state subsidies, the credibility of the soccer and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation of the sport (ČSTV) which it will try to endow with a new address to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the home of lotteries Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík will fight because it reaches the presidency, because it does not find a more adequate candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the soccer players of Pilsen, Sockets Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an adequate candidate who satisfied all its ideas on the new president of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAČR), he would not even present himself as candidate to such a relevant post. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there were an adequate person, it would be fighting for it and would not present as candidate to the choices.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But until the day of today a person has not been able to be found like this&quot;, said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK) </seg>
<seg id="552"> What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility to block Pelta, the winning supposition of the choices, that opens the path to the presidency of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR). </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that, in case to beat, would remain in the charge of president alone up to 2013, when would arrive the turn of the ordinary general assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In that charge it would like to see an expert and good manager who is not related too much with the soccer events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have already talked with some people that it could have in account&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was a madness to hear to some to say that now they not even want to be identified with the Czech soccer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;It would please me to change that vision&quot;, adds. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What bothers Paclík supposedly more now is the relation of Pelta with the President of the Association of Regional Soccer of known Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, out of the world as a powerful lobista with capacity to be influential in the poll of the delegates in the general assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential armchair. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he wins, the current status would keep and nothing in the soccer will change&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, the soccer will still benefit less&quot;, said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> He mentions also the fact that some years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a tapping during the research of a case of corruption, from which Pelta went out unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know which prestige to the soccer could bring the victory of Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And with which eyes it will look us the UEFA and the FIFA&quot;, said Paclík, which also takes with a certain precaution its previous declaration that would &quot;sell the Club Pilsen if Pelta be converted in president&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case of winning the choices of Thursday, the cooperation with Pelta could be suggested by Paclík in the future. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Of the same opinion, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly of September that it finished in a fiasco, is the other candidate. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first that he would follow&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="568"> It &quot;is very capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine it, for example, as head of the representation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;but not as manager of an association&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I do not put the noses either there where I do not feel capable&quot;, added Paclík, which in September sparked off a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Commission of Referees presided over by Ludek Macel, replaced afterwards by Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> He recurs to its capacities of management of the private enterprises, for since last summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who with its support celebrated in May the triumph in first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;Tengo forces to change some things in the area of soccer and to contribute to its safe practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to be influential in the decisions of the disciplinary committee and of advocation, causing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding its antipathy towards the president of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> One of the priorities would also be that of consolidating the relation between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on the political leaders so that more money to the sport of the taxes of the lottery is destined. </seg>
<seg id="577"> It &quot;is one of the key problems that the new president should dedicate himself to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If they increased the taxes on the games of chance, as announce it the political parties, it would support its arguments, but, frankly, all this money has to say where it is going to stop us&quot;, indicates. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Ademas, Paclík now does not take into account at least its association with the Club Pilsner, although it himself states that the President of the FAČR must be &quot;not partisan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is in turn an associate with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But I do not see to return there after a year meaning to the fact that yields hypocritically my actions of the Club of Pilsen to another person for afterwards and means&quot;, said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised the FAČR new statues that they would finish with the neutral gear of the choices. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Soccer one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if it was chosen, it would guarantee that the FAČR had some new statues that definitely were used for solving, in the future, the controversies as for the electoral regulation. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic as for the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and thinks that the pre-electoral conflict could advance towards a solution today with the possible victory of the equipment of soccer. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Already before the choices not carried out in September, Pelta promised to be focused, if it was chosen, precisely in the representation and in raising backgrounds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided to take part in the last minute in the last general assembly, therefore this adjournment of two months could go well for him to defend and to present, in a wider context, its ideas on the management of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people of all the levels are in charge of the soccer already a lot of time ago and expects to know this Thursday the new President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that the hour that somebody manages the association has arrived&quot;, the man that is associated mainly with the Club of Jablonice, but that worked in the Sparta and in the executive committee of the Association thinks. </seg>
<seg id="590"> For this reason, he thinks to have sufficient experience to manage the Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced that behind the current problems with the choices is the euphoria that reigned in the period of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Regrettably, in the general Assembly of June the statues that were not as perfect as all thought were approved.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we already have a president since September&quot;, noticed Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as decoy to get round the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If they choose me president, will take it to myself as a personal challenge and I am ready to answer if this fails.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> It &quot;is a question of beginnings, without which we can not exist&quot;, says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Besides, in theory, he tries not to enter with its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> It had already in the past warned that it was seen collaborating with Henry Rajchl, who he respects by its formation in Law, its first vice-president being conscious that its opponent would be besides. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Already the one who, contrary to Pelta, did not leave puppet with head had been not attacking a lot of time Thomas Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;Takes more than one year in the world of soccer, and has already achieved some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Its attacks but were shameful and many people remained surprised by the election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;That&apos;s why many of them doubt on its real character&quot;, told to its opponent Pelta, which keeps being faithful to the declarations announced already in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Its most powerful weapon is, according to it, its knowledge of the soccer, from the lowest competitions up to the superior ones. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This last one should be a shop window of promotion of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Likewise, it would try to solve all the scandals that rose because of the Bohemians as consequence of the scandal of corruption of the last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately afterwards I would get involved in the negotiations with the public sector and the one deprived, to guarantee that there is sufficient money for all the soccer&quot;, told two months ago To the ČTK the candidate of 46 years. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Next he also promised that its nomination as president of the soccer would not entail any personal modification of the staff. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;It should know first the tasks of every employee&quot;, said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness reigns. </seg>
<seg id="609"> In spite of the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, undoubtedly we will manage it to surpass. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;The soccer needs credibility, which will be recovered alone if at last it has a leader,&quot; still two days before the most decisive day in its career of representative, Pelta keeps being optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises, that under its leadership, the FAČR would start to work with desires. </seg>
<seg id="613"> If in the fourth General Assembly it goes out chosen the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as new president of the Czech Association of Soccer, many people would probably be shown suffered. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that, if it was chosen, it would be worked hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to implement a systematic change and to make the members of the executive committee be responsible for every area of the soccer individually. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also commits itself to solving the case of the Bohemians, improving the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, obtaining more money for the soccer and continuing with the work initiated by the previous president Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As president, I would like completely to dedicate myself to the soccer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;From the international contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA up to the selection, passing by the professional soccer or the training of young soccer players of high yield.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;With this I do not mean that it would do it everything alone&quot;, said Rajchl in an interview for the ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a player of equipment and want to divide up the competences of the executive committee in such a way that every member can be dedicated at an area specifies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will assign difficult tasks so that the soccer can, in each of those segments, to follow ahead by far impulse&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;Many people this probably will not like it, because it will mean to start to work very hard and not only to criticize the work of the others&quot;, added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the soccer movement, it is said that she has considered as candidate the possibility not to present herself again. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;All know, that I work 20 daily hours.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know that this will have felt and that there will not be people behind of my that it will prevent me and it will hinder to every crossing&quot;, explained like this the motifs of its indecision. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people have told me that I must not consider myself beaten, because then the others would consider themselves beaten also.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> It &quot;is a matter of having faith not to abandon like this, simply&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> As they say, it motivates to him also to continue the work that he already started with Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;During those two years, a great part of the work that I do not want that now is lost ended&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that had been started and that will have its effect in a couple of years and it would not please me that somebody stops them&quot;, announced worried for that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association would be able to be again as it was before the period of Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in the order, and it is something which, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not capable of holding. </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind it all those people that would be in charge of the soccer so that a privilege was alone for some chosen is especially.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;A heap of things, but not the fact that I am in favor of somebody can be reproached me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;Attempt to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to do a soccer for all, because alone like this will be felt well all and not alone the chosen ones&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> It refuses also the idea that alone serious bohemian the president. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Although some people try to state the opposite, I have in mind to do what is maximum for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is an hour of thinking in the fact that it divides up the second division into a Czech part and in another morava, whose winners would go to the first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Three equipments of Moravia would not be given by the current situation in the one that we have alone, which represents a problem for the moravos players young,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Although the fight of the presidential choices was added to Tomas Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl does not stop believing in its possibilities to be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;It still goes to have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which chose me as its vice-president and which knows that behind me there are clear successes&quot;, said Rajchl, whose successes understand the saving of some tens of millions of crowns of disadvantageous contracts, the negotiations of television contracts and the negotiations on the law of the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand, he recognizes its part of fault in which the federation is not joined. </seg>
<seg id="643"> And while he proclaims that Pelta is &quot;disqualified to recover the confidence in the Czech soccer&quot;, he considers the other competitor, Paclík, as a strong candidate who yes has something to offer to the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can deny that he did a great work for the Pilsen that year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;In the case that it is chosen, probably it will follow what already started Ivan Hasek and not cambiaria significantly the staff of the staff in the committees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;I do not want to use that to my favor&quot;, evaluates like this its competitors Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The prettiest pools of Europe </seg>
<seg id="648"> Jump to the blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> for Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Pools from an incredible optics, sumptuous baths in Budapest: The one who visits Europe can live its blue marvel, and, after a visit to the city or a hike, rest its tired legs on bubbly baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where it finds the best welfare in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder carried out a journey of research during the year and half a past, there was something that could not be lacking in its luggage, a swimsuit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Knocked down from behind on the water, it looked the artistic dome in what was high, swam towards the angelotes of marble, which waited it in the edge of the pool and was amazed in front of the modernistic covered pool restored meticulously. </seg>
<seg id="654"> The bath liked it, wrote down in its notebook to the moment of all the interesting details on the style and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 pools this way and presents them in its recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: the pools covered in Munich, the historical palaces of the bath in the Black Forest, the &quot;constructions of concrete&quot; in Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> He carried out its &quot;journey through the most extraordinary baths of Centroeuropa&quot; for 13 countries: Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> This German of 46 years is a real enthusiast of the culture of the bath. </seg>
<seg id="658"> It does not want to have to do anything with the sport, says Meder, alone the water is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Alone bothers it that the amateurs have to be adjusted to the bath with blue tiles and stench to chlorine, whereas the amateurs of running can breathe the gripping smell of the forests of firs or to listen to the happy trills of the birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;A day I wondered why the pools always have to be so ugly&quot;, states this inhabitant of Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I started to collect pretty pools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of the water doubles the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="663"> The splashing in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of welfare in the pools is so big because all the meanings, according to Meder, are attended to. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builder makes an effort, the covered pools can be a real gift for the sight: &quot;Instead of ground, in the baths a surface of water is had.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;For a part it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of all the building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> Everything doubles optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colors, the springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The book with photographs in small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides very interesting data on the architecture and the art history in the historical oases of the welfare on 190 pages, but, mainly, it gives desires of jumping to the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Meder, the collector of pools discovers the copies stood out in its researches in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Beside the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath of Széchenyi of Budapest, of 100 years, the waters with nitrates in a singular kárstica cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some springs, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are in a building with form of bottle are found (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular sights: While all the city puts the eyes in the pool roofed of Zurich, Arlberb, cover of snow, can be looked at from the exterior pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which the practice can be observed in the tracks of ski. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The design, perhaps, more extraordinary waiting to the customers in Längenfeld: The cathedral of the water of Ötztal seems a UFO that has just landed in Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Of three open fountains it goes up steam in winter, whereas underlying the mountains of Ötztal are raised in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> The smell of chlorine did not invade Meder, the collector of pools, in all the pools. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague to gas oil is so strong that the people think to have arrived to a sanitary bath. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose légamo sticks to the skin when entering the pool, an enjoyment of the welfare in a special way. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in its search of pretty places for the bath, when it wanted to visit open pools and baths of sun in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, found a blocked ground. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath of 1902 of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When Meder looked through the windows of the red, white and yellow modernistic building worn away, he saw the undergrowth to grow among the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> The decay counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald. </seg>
<seg id="681"> These baths have three phases of construction after themselves; not alone can be discovered neorománicos elements of times of its construction in 1844, if not also an Arab hall of style Alhambra, added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> From its neat modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the collector of pools, Iris Meder, and not alone because it is natural of the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;Has a lot merit to fuse different architectonic styles in such a fantastic unit&quot;, states Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In a palace like this the immersion in the thermal pool in an apparent way is not important a lot of. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Land speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> The Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of the raw materials </seg>
<seg id="687"> For Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Does the Deutsche Bank to its business renounce with agricultural raw materials? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has ordered a work group to check the consequences of the speculation for the poor ones of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg, </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, to 84 per cent of the Germans does not seem them acceptable that the banks speculate on the agricultural raw materials as the wheat or the corn. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of the interviewed ones claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions move away from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of an enquiry to order of the organization of consumers Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch mid October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the bags of global raw materials make the prices go up, and the banks take on the responsibility of the world problem of the hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the defender of the consumer is addressed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although the big banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act as similar way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally, the bets on raw materials were thought to protect the traders of the oscillations of the prices. </seg>
<seg id="699"> The main experts agree in that the players have disconnected of the offers and demands, and take profits of the costs of the poorest. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann reacted before the criticisms in a different way that the American competitors: He promised to revise the claims and said that no business &quot;deserves to jeopardize the good fame of the Deutsche Bank&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international work group is revising the claims of the report of Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The analysis must be finished at the end of year, then the results to the directive of the Deutsche Bank will be presented, together with the recommendation of how to handle the matter. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January, the address of the bank will inform about the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> In the end a reduction of the business of the raw materials, or even its total abandonment could occur. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann tries to fix its image. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but he reaffirmed its criticisms to the financial sector: &quot;The bets to increasing prices of foods show in a specially drastic way how the cruel banks damage the public good at present.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann is found as the oldest bank lobbyist, especially in the duties. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The Deutsche Bank must nullify all the inversions of its wallet in which he puts the money in game for bets of food prices&quot;, stated Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It makes no difference if Ackermann deals the subject of the people that passes hunger or the fame of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving its post. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the president of the board of management will change something different with what has not been planned in the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation it can perfect its image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And needs that as soon as they import it possible leaks, its successor will be in charge of that. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Two thirds would nullify the inversion in raw materials </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure high on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Up to the moment, more than 30,000 Internet users have taken part in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday, Bode published the enquiry for which the Instituto Forsa had asked 1,001 people the 7th and the 8th of November. </seg>
<seg id="718"> 10 per cent hardly considered it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offered inversions in which they bet the prices of the foods. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when discovering that its bank took part in such businesses: according to the enquiry, two thirds would nullify all the inversions from which money of the land speculation comes out. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 per cent would advise its acquaintances against a bank like this, 49 per cent would request, after reflecting, to nullify its account and it would be changed with another institute. </seg>
<seg id="721"> The home 21 in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The transferred pavilion </seg>
<seg id="723"> For Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with up and downs and a happy end, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 obtained prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was remained empty and fell apart. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it reopens as home of exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The architecture of modern postgerra loves, the clear forms, the halls of crystal, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of the thought on the technical progress, for what, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is an adequate and known example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Pavilion of Schwanzer obtained then the Grand Prix de Arquitectura by its slight and floating steel construction and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is considered up to the present a milestone contemporaneous with the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He did the architect who was so known who also built the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary tower of four more cylinders for MBW the adjacent building leveled in Munich, happened to internationally be known. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions got up after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten beside the station of the south of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated inside, was called the &quot;home 20&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building was adapted but it lacked the adequate spaces and technology for a museum; without no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="733"> In spite of that it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The building is empty since 2001 and decays every time more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> At present, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, he now calls it &quot;home 21&quot; and it will be used in the future as museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday the belvedere museum, which the home belongs to, was inaugurated in the afternoon with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new manageress of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in its youth, later in Sotheby, the museum Guggenheim and founding manageress of the museum of modern art of Salzburgo, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for the contemporary art, are exposed the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation, there should be a café and a bookstore and besides an office block to be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict control, low budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was the best choice to make it. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not alone because it reformed appreciably the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, extended it and the competition was granted to him, if not because it studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion it was for it an &quot;important and immense place&quot;, in which he contemplated &quot;almost all the weekends&quot; the exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and easiness. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was &quot;one voracious of energy&quot;, said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profile of the windows of the façade of crystal was changed, a superinsulant crystal with fiberglass was installed and he remplazó the ceiling of crystal for a special safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The heat bridges and the beams of steel were reinforced or remplazaron and the ceilings of asbestos were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light gone down between the home and the street provides the lighting, a bridge the pavilion of Schwanzer acts to enter to the almost new building, but still. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original exterior doors remain, the home is painted in old pitches mahogany and protected against the oxidation. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the room of cinema is exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often it had to find material that it was good, cheap and the office of protection of monuments also liked&quot;, states Krischanitz and warns about a rough ground in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> In spite of all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> That of the pavilion &quot;that came of Brussels&quot; has been difficult, stated does little Krischanitz, a typical &quot;casual appearance in the history of the city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> An architecture like this is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and that&apos;s why it wanted &quot;to arouse the adequate conscience&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case the home 21 is not in the wrong place, an urbanistic stroke of luck has happened. The totally new and planned &quot;neighborhood of the main station&quot;, with houses and offices, is beside the Schweizer Garten. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck perhaps succeeds: The home 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, then the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary art from Berlin and, as it is heard, it negotiates with the city on an adjacent place in the Schweizer Garten. </seg>

<seg id="766"> Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned about breakdowns and delays in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and the industry. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travellers, since, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Many new regional trains take years waiting for an authorization of the federal train office. </seg>
<seg id="769"> Besides there is a delay in the delivery of the high-speed trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Deutsche Bahn works from years in checking the axes of the high-speed trains frequently in the factory, after a high-speed train suffered the breaking of an axis in the main station of Cologne. </seg>

<seg id="775"> The regulating one of financial markets NCUA reproaches many big banks to induce the credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Such bonds lost its value during the financial crisis and drag the banks at the depths. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are satisfied of being able to clarify the subject without the parts having to go to the courts&quot;, said a spokesman of the Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This also applies to Citigroup, which obliged a payment of 20.5 million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the credit unions of the US. and gives support in the event of bankruptcy to protect the inversions of customers. </seg>

<seg id="784"> The regulator had also asked for accounts to other big banks and in started summer lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> In the matter of the doubtful mortgage bonds, it is about the called values backed up by mortgages. </seg>
<seg id="786"> These base themselves on house loans. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the property bubble of the US. exploded in 2007, it led to the perdition to many financial institutions. </seg>

<seg id="791"> The Federal Agency of Financing of House (FHFA in its initials in English) has produced the biggest quantity of demands. </seg>
<seg id="792"> He reproaches the 18 big international banks that the two American state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use have been made of the business of the mortgages in a volume of approximately 200 thousand for millions of dollars. </seg>

<seg id="804"> Buffett revealed at present in the broadcasting station of economics CNBC that has acquired actions of IBM for a value of 10.7 thousands of millions of dollars since March. </seg>
<seg id="805"> Its Berkshire Hathaway of inversions has promoted one of the oldest stockholders of IBM with that with a participation of 5.5 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="806"> Buffett said that IBM did not know anything of the appointment until now. </seg>
<seg id="807"> He praised the address that was in charge of the ordinary profits in the economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;They have done a brilliant work&quot;, stated Buffett on the strategy. </seg>
<seg id="809"> IBM established since some time ago the lucrative services of Information Technologies as the functioning of computer centers. </seg>
<seg id="810"> The computer pioneer old man of more than 100 years also offers software and advice like this as powerful equipments for companies. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Buffett prevented the companies of technology up to the date. </seg>
<seg id="812"> It said that alone inverted in companies whose businesses it understood. </seg>
<seg id="813"> On the contrary, Buffett seized the occasion in a goods train, in a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Its Berkshire Hathaway possesses Münchener Rück near approximately 80 own subsidiaries, thus as part of all a series of big consortiums as Coca-Cola or D Munich, formerly. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Buffett, of 81 years, saw about the textile small enterprise Berkshire Hathaway in the sixties and, with wise inversions, he extended it until it converted it in one of the most valuable companies of the world. </seg>
<seg id="816"> However, its way of life is humble. </seg>
<seg id="817"> That&apos;s why it is an idol for innumerable investors of all the world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Its fast and infallible meaning to gain money has provided it with the nickname of &quot;oracle of Omaha&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After discovering the inversion of Buffett, the actions of IBM in bag raised one per cent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;The blue giant&quot;, as IBM is known, a value in bag of more than 220 has a billion dollars and it appears, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable companies of technology of the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> With Microsoft, it stated Buffett, does not want to collaborate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat becomes definite </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of &quot;the cell of Zwickau&quot;, the Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper talks about a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that is revived again. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight small trick businessmen and Greeks among the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right. </seg>
<seg id="827"> In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin people have reacted with fear and worry in the face of this news. </seg>
<seg id="828"> For many Germans of Turkish origin a ghost that was believed dead some time ago goes back, from the attacks with form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, more episodes of violence had not happened with background of extreme right against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> However, it has never been questioned that in Germany there is xenophobia. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The open right-wing net reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were, by no means, foreseeable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;The bloody ideology is revived again?&quot;, titles the edition for internet of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; stands out on the contrary that one of the authors of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and concern is shown for the German authorities being able to be implicated in the right-wing pantanal. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The Turkish community in Germany reacted with good sense, the weekend remembered the casualties of the racist violence with a wakefulness in front of the Door of Brandenburg. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German politicians and Turks reflected in a solemn act of the fifty anniversary of the Turkish agreement-German. </seg>
<seg id="835"> The communal life set in scene with bright colors, as a history with happy end. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The information arrived to some Turkish means as a slap: &quot;The German gift for the fifty anniversary&quot;, says the bond of an article in the Turkish platform of internet To &quot;Have X&quot;, referring to the background of the chain of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The German broadcast &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not insist on drawing this mental connection either. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It starts to smell badly&quot;, says the bond of the column of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It stands out that the murdered ones were people that paid its taxes and they did an important contribution with its work to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> In the forums of internet of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its subsequent success in the searches they are discussed very critically. </seg>
<seg id="841"> The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not searched a lot before suspect in the circle of the ultraright one. </seg>
<seg id="842"> One is shown what less rhetorical as for the drastic means: &quot;From now here it is lost, the immigrants do not have more than the self-defense and the armament&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;This will be the best selfprotection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;The internal peace of Germany depends strongly on the quality of the clarification and on the adequacy of the sanction to all the net&quot;., writes &quot;Selen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will become clear in ninety years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories. </seg>
<seg id="847"> No other event showed more clearly the Turks who live here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that the mistrust and the distance can lead to the violence. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks sharpen the feeling of group of the Turkish part. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Not repeating the errors of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press the deficiency of the German policy was criticized then mainly after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visiting the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the attack with form of fire of Solingen it sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, its minister of Foreign Affairs, replaced it in the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in its speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with the taxes. </seg>
<seg id="852"> It remains clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current information of the Turkish means shows how deep the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin is, since then, in the legality of this country again. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Besides besides of the effort of a wide explanation and of a re-appraisal of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, this time frank words are necessary. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank of the scandal of the lake of Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The riskiest bank of Europe is not in Italy nor France, if not in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS almost entered bankruptcy in the financial crisis and slid since then of a crisis to the following one. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now a German directs it. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Insurance that had not thought Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After its spectacular departure of the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 it would start in one new and almost equally of spectacular work: President of the administrative board of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative crossing in its career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber is cheered up publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and to the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets fall nice observations on its future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The USB has achieved a revitalization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;It cheers me up to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> In September clearing remained that all would be totally different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the systems of safety of the bank and disappointed 1.7 a billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Oswald Grübel, chief operating officer of the USB, a banker not alone known in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The president of the administrative board of the USB was considered since then equally touched, and all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive? </seg>
<seg id="868"> It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And will see about the presidency of the administrative board in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> This is hard for Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Professor of economics and adviser is not a banker, rather, and it has probably had a period of adaptation necessary. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At once it is made responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just returned prove that it deserves the bond &quot;the biggest bank of the scandal of Europe&quot; since some time ago. </seg>
<seg id="873"> For a part, the USB is enormous, he was the oldest world trustee work until not long ago, and on the other hand, since years ago, it slides of a scandal to the following one. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, like this seems it, is saved it to the formerly that is so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The USB had an excellent fame up to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss trustee work discrete and solid, but also artful, was combined with ambitious goals, it also wanted to be a great number in the investment banks. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On a part, with 1.6 trillion dollars, the USB manages more money of rich customers than any other bank of the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, it advanced as investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Hans Geiger, the former banker and posterior professor of banking in Zurich during many years explains: &quot;Before my students, I have always qualified to the USB as model of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From the current point of view, one wonders: How it could mistake me?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> It was in a great error. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 it brought to light that something came out very badly in the USB. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of year, Peter Wuffli, chief operating officer, who until then was considered as a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months afterwards, the reason was suspected. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The background of inversions of the bank was embarked on leaks with bonds of high risk and had to redeem thousands of millions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To load with this, the USB announced an injection of capital of anything less than of 13 a billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this it found inversive, naturally that some looked with contempt until little before: an Asian and opaque state background of Singapore and an Arab state background, that is so discrete, that had never been heard its name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This was alone the first knock. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to declare the leak of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative board, in 2006 in the second better paid administrative boards of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, it continued the catastrophe, in view of its misdirect investments, the UBS was in the financial crisis in the face of the bankruptcy and it had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many thousands of millions, the Swiss Confederation gave six thousands of millions of francs for an obligatorily convertible bond, through which it converted in co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> All Switzerland was affected, how dramatic was this for a small country, if it lodges such big banks, was stated. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally the addition of the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times bigger than the economic results of Switzerland (to see graph). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We can not rescue again to the UBS&quot;, said Geiger, expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The second joined the first catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Few months afterwards, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and appeared ready to deliver the data of the rich customers, who possibly had disappointed taxes with help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Besides, he approves a cipher of 780 thousands of millions of dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits of these businesses with a compensation for payment. </seg>
<seg id="901"> With that, the UBS confessed more or less to having helped in the tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Simultaneously it wasted something that had been since always its capital in the competence for rich customers: the halo of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank any longer is not it. </seg>
<seg id="904"> To this followed the resignation of the president of the board of management and of the president of the administrative board. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of the backgrounds of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="906"> This way, in few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment banking through the wrong speculations and in the administration of goods through the help to the tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And exactly when it was a little calmer again, exactly when it was thought that the UBS obtained it again, this unhappy history of the operator happens, an individual operator disappointed 1.7 a billion euros, before the bank realized that something went badly. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And was revealed, apparently, this yet does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli it is declared that the controls of risk have changed too little&quot;, states Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finances in the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The chief financial officer of a big German bank is also sure: &quot;The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the controls of risk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="911"> For what the idea about the precaution, with which the Swiss bankers presented themselves since some time ago rose, to be the guardians of the biggest goods of the world: no too great risk, however, the safety of the money wants to crack to the other side of the alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The deposits of safety of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliche of the solid Swiss private bank, alone is a little old. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its main headquarters on Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the master station to the lake of Zurich, framed by the summits covered of snow of the Swiss mountains, directly. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Here jewelries as Tiffany&apos;s are among Swiss traditional businesses as the sweet shop Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Here lie since years ago the Swiss banks: from the national bank, happening through the palace of Credit Suisse, up to the private banks elitarios as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It is entered in the room of reception of the UBS through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are lined with marble, in front armchairs of leather are found big, beside the logo of the bank there is a big sign to indicate the &quot;safety&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer looks for here: Safety. </seg>
<seg id="922"> The two big Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, in some moment have displaced the idea about the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank gives an opinion. </seg>
<seg id="923"> It prefers not reading its name in the newspaper, after all it does, as all the Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has been done too big, gives an opinion, mainly in the investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground. </seg>
<seg id="925"> There the Swiss did not have anything else to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And have been gotten used for a lot of time to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first great profit and afterwards the disaster came, no European financial institution had lost money in the jungle of the high risk as well as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On the 15th of October 2008, the catastrophe was evident. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;That Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in its book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish). </seg>
<seg id="930"> The politicians granted up to 68 thousands of millions of francs or approximately 45 thousands of millions of euros to save the big bank of the bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How does it occur to them? </seg>
<seg id="932"> It is spoken with the Swiss bankers, like this see the problem in the dimension of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three big Swiss banks merge in a powerful consortium. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank that, due to the merge, was too big for the small Switzerland rises up, and it keeps growing. </seg>
<seg id="935"> For what it acted so that the two different banks introductory of the UBS were complemented: a bank rich but asleep with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the internationalized merchant banks arrived appropriately with a lot of money, with the one that they could make film a big financial bicycle. </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are two related names with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect equipment&quot;, says the expert in banking Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the, modest intellectual, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that it managed to make the way from the learning in the bank up to the summit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive error: &quot;It thought that its models were a reality&quot;, says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> It &quot;is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, maybe. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: The tactlessness arrived before the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The employees of the UBS remember clearly the meetings of managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Lowering from the throne to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful merchant bank of the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> They led the &quot;League Tables&quot;, the classifications that then documented the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> The UBS wanted to be in the summit. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some crossings came out for him well. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the operations of exchanges and in the negotiation of actions it was in the highest thing. </seg>
<seg id="951"> However, the responsible advisors of companies highlighted a weakness: In the business of the international interest, in the language of banking &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is an enormous compensation for the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS has emptiness in the American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill this emptiness, the UBS started an adventure that almost costs it its existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Eager for growth, inverted the same bank as well as one of its backgrounds of high risk created in American inversions of high risk. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It was transformed into a powerful machine to titularizar American mortgage credits and to sell them next, maintaining specific risks on account own. </seg>
<seg id="956"> And also, as other banks it looked for the descent for a lot of time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> In summer of 2007, as the American property market was ablaze,&quot; the UBS bought there, &quot;said Geiger, expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So big the euphoria, so deep the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager had to leave, since the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The posts in the UBS turned into projectable seats and are insecure up to the present. </seg>
<seg id="961"> At present, the one who manages a big bank, has an almost impossible work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It must find a strategy for a bank, in the face of which all the logical models of business are lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, to put an end to the investment banking, to be concentrated in the administration of goods, to go back to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The bank does not want to arrive so far (still). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking must decrease a lot, is clear at present. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> In fact, alone was thought in the Italian-Swiss of 51 years as a temporary solution, since the bank the bank was separated surprisingly of its predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, he imposed itself: It must direct permanently the businesses of the UBS, communicated the bank of Zurich on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to return the merchant bank to its state in the middle of the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="970"> He suppresses 3,500 posts. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But this is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what does he want to gain money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that insurance is done Axel Weber at present. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Up to the moment alone he says that first he will look for a house with its woman in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The following year. </seg>
<seg id="978"> The fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the American bag </seg>
<seg id="979"> The imminent recession in Europe has given fear of the American investors in the beginning of the week. </seg>
<seg id="980"> The changes of government in Athens and Rome continue without vigor. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The industrial production stopped in the continent puts down the expectations to stabilize in its origin a crisis provoked by the indebtedness. </seg>

<seg id="991"> The industry of the 17 euro countries has reduced its production clearly and places itself in the end of its apogee. </seg>
<seg id="992"> The companies produced in September two per cent less than the previous month, as it informs the office of statistics of Eurostat. </seg>
<seg id="993"> What created scepticism among the American investors: &quot;We are not an island, if not dependent&quot;, said Steve Goldman de Goldman Management. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe can not be released so quickly of a recession, besides there are more signs of weakness in the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Warren Buffett, the legend of the inversions, alone confirmed this precaution, yet it is not clear if Europe is strong enough to do all what is necessary to put an end to the crisis, stated in an interview for the CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> That&apos;s why, from its point of view it is too soon to invest in state borrowings or European banks. </seg>
<seg id="997"> Instead of that, it throws a decade of old beginnings through the gunwale and enters the American technological sector. </seg>
<seg id="998"> Its inversion of more than ten thousand a million dollars in IBM supports the price of the actions of the traditional consortium and makes it value hardly one higher percentage against the trend in the market at the beginning. </seg>

<seg id="1258"> Massacre at personal level </seg>
<seg id="1259"> The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, La beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate history about the First World War, &quot;starts with a long dramatis personae of the type that the soul can make to one fall it at the feet. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Here are some boards of performance: It pulls softly this page and converts it in its brand pages. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> He will get to know very well these people in the novelistic narration of Mr. Englund, and this dramatis personae will work as its GPS, a light during those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, it is confusing and forsaken in the fog of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Mr. Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Prize Nobel de Literatura. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> What he has written here is a little ordinary book, which he describes, wisely, as &quot;a work of anti-history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains some remarkable names, important treaties or famous battles; practically there are not ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or material. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is not so much a book about what it happened, explains, as &quot;a book about how it happened&quot;. It deals about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle &quot;combines the experiences in times of war of more or less 20 men and ordinary women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, drivers of ambulance and clerks. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some will convert in prisoners of war, or its members will lose, mad people will turn or they will die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Its lives blink here as candles votive turned on in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others fade away. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation of the books of standard history. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It is also one corrective to the notion of which the First World War alone was the disastrous trench warfare in the occidental front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; moves expertly across other theaters of war: Alps, the Balkans, the oriental front, Mesopotamia, Africa of the East. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> To the soldiers in this book the beehives fall above for them; one passes the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is a touching book, almost from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war floods the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that stinks to cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or do you run away? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Anyway who comes? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost nobody understands what is passing, not even why this war has to be fought. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Lack of facts&quot;, observes Mr. Englund, &quot;theories of the conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and rumors has been filled in with conjectures, assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; follows individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a German seafaring youngster of the fleet of high sea. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Its histories have been obtained mostly from memories, cards and another material already published previously. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The explanations of its lives can be terrifying or touching, but they are fuller of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of these are about deprivations and of fixing them for him with what there is. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> About telling the history of a German schoolgirl he says: &quot;Ersatz, everywhere ersatz&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Substitute of coffee, false aluminum, gum of imitation, bandages of paper, wooden buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> It continues talking about the ersatz food in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> It describes &quot;meat done from cooked rice and pressing in grease of ram (and finished off with a false bone fact wooden); tobacco done of roots and peelings of dry potatoes; shoes with you tend wooden&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There is, observes, &quot;837 allowed substitutes of the meat in the production of sausages, 511 substitutes of the coffee registered&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some histories are about the honor and the value. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes its own impulse towards the savagery and expresses about the war: &quot;You feel that, after all, this is for what the men are conceived and not to be sat in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the newspaper of the afternoon or a best seller, and to intend that that varnish means civilization and that there is not a barbarian behind that starched and studded bosom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> However a British soldier realizes that probably it will die, and that nobody will find out or will be important to him. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;Once one resigns itself to the thought of being sacrificed, one would like it to think that it could happen in front of the public&quot;, writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> However, it is horribly similar &quot;to one condemned being strangled in secret&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations are Europe about an old man disappearing, and about new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict has been converted every time more in an economic competition&quot;, the gentleman writes Englund, &quot;a war among factories&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new sort in the bestiary of the young century: The murderer in mass eloquent and convinced ideologically with clothes of good dressmaking who executes its carnage while it is sitting behind a desk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> The people behave in unexpected ways; there is so much ignoble behavior as heroic. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers that tried actively to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as way of evading the service in the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The trade of gonocócico pus, which the soldiers buy and daub with that its genitals with the expectation to finish in hospital can be seen by the most grotesque expression of this&quot;, writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those that are really despaired rub it on its eyes, what often gives rise to a blindness forever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from the Swede done by Peter Graves, the prose of agile but not extravagant Mr. Englund, it is perfectly adapted to its human task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to &quot;broken out exceptionally uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The people start to ask why its leaders are making them fight. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as La Gran Guerra and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Sin novelty in the front of Erich María Remarque, instead of integral histories. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The volume of Mr. Englund joins to an off-center pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Its book has one of the most devastating ends that I can remember in a work of non fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I will not reveal it. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But is as if it had arrived from its book, pulled off among your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned it with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a crossing falsely previous, an assault planned per minute </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of policemen were involved, some of them taking riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> It was chosen the night of Monday to Tuesday because the park Zuccotti would be emptier. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation kept in secret except for a few officers of high range, telling at first those ones that they were joining an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, its presence underlined how the operation was filled with challenges for the department of police. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> The episodes of recent weeks, as the pulverization of pepper spray on the demonstrators, could not be repeated infringing the norms of the department and creating a storm of public friendliness towards the &quot;squatters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And because of that the police operation to clear the park Zuccotti of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The agents had prepared seeing the occupations as they had developed in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A simulation of bigger catastrophe was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The agents increased the called training of disorders - measured counterterrorists that they implied mobilizing quickly to a great number of officers of police - to focus on the Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last session of training was in the night of Monday, on the side of Manhattan of the river East. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> You order them of entering in the park arrived in the &quot;last minute&quot;, said somebody familiarized with the orders, which were referred to the mission alone as &quot;an exercise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;They did not tell them, the few polis that I know that were called for this, that it was to enter in the park Zuccotti&quot;, said the person, which spoke anonymously. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only people that knew that they were going to enter in the park Zuccotti were in the highest levels of the department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> A reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned through the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 of October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of demonstrators rose before time after having heard about the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation of Tuesday implicated agents of several police units, including special forces of all the municipal district - tens of mobile agents who usually used to flood the neighborhoods with high index of criminality. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that many people, as those, had been going that travel daily to the work and coming of the park during the day, acting as the 1 a.m. a good hour to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;Was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people in the park was&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Trucks of the Unit of emergency Services with focuses and loudspeakers were gathered together in the cross of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before going out. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and the prerecorded messages that echoed from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> The agents of community matters went to the park with its light blue windbreaks, many demonstrators simply collected its things and they left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Any store up to the 1:45 was not touched a.m., said the police, the demonstrators having time to comprising its belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other equipments of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter the park if it was needed to do arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The journalists in the park were forced to abandon it. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the head spokesman of the Department of Policeman, said that it was for its safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists said that it was tried to avoid their seeing the police to come into action in the park, and that they had been dealt brusquely by the agents. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that the mobile units of television in Church Street, along the occidental edge of the park, could capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> As the police moved towards the west through the dense tangle of personal belongings of the demonstrators, including luggages and refuse sacks of paper and of plastic crowded with clothes, equipments of the Department of Cleaning followed them, comprising what she forgot behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some demonstrators who refused to moving went outside dragged, images in Internet appearing little time afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A central group of demonstrators took positions near the area of cooking of the camp, near the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> About about 10 people in the epicenter of the camp he candaron among them for the arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The agents of the service of emergencies were called to cut the padlocks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Were not done arrests in the park even more or less the 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The operation of removal was complete about 75 minutes afterwards, said the police. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests were for &quot;breach of the peace and endurance to the authority&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The agent of higher range in the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the superior officer made uniform in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives of the department, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly, while it was present, &quot;was not directing the operations&quot;, said Mr. Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of agents waited throughout the oriental side of Broadway, between the streets Liberty and Cedar, in the event of their having to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades on Cortlandt street, a block in the north of the park, and on Pine street, a block in the south rose up. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> From those positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond the park Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> In a given moment, a series of agents, many of them with escudos, were seen pushing the people towards outside. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> There were about 28 people in the north perimeter. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> One of the noisiest action of the night took place in the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> About the 5 of them a.m., in the south of the street Pine, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a car of policeman, and to others it was seen taking away the air of the wheels of a van of police. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> In a given moment, a part of plywood came out flying from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The trade union of workers of support will sue to the city for the dismissals </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The trade union that represents hundreds of workers of school support that its employments lost last month plans for the city to sue on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to its disproportionate impact on the schools that attend to poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The demand is, possibly, the last weapon availably of the trade union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred seventy and two assistants of the school, the coordinators of fathers and other employees that were among the ones worse paid of the city lost its work the 7 of October, in a movement that the union leaders have described the access on the part of the city to a background of sanitary assistance as a political revenge for its refusal to allow, last spring, in charge of work groups to close its budgetary gap. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The municipal authorities have denied that accusation categorically. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> In an audience in the Town Council last month, the adviser of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dismissals were a part of the approved budget in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Board counter-attacked telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the staff of support of the school would be dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Civil servants of the municipal district 37 said that they presented the claim in writing, noticing the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be celebrated on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in the State High Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The demand will include to Mr. Walcott and to the Department of Education of the city as accused, and account with eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latin women, as most of the assistants that lost its employments. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and could therefore not do comments on its specific allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the trade union has focused in the number of dismissals on the schools of poor areas of the city to support a claim by unfair deal, saying that the poor schools lost more attendant, since they had been insufficiently subsidized chronically. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> It is indicated that although there were not dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals at schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost its employments in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Taking into account the leak of five of the eight assistants used by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students lives in the poverty, the demand says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of rich fathers that can raise backgrounds to cover the budget deficit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.D. The budget of the district 36 came down to 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way in which he calculates the additional financing for every registration for poor student at schools. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The trade union also states that the directors of secondary schools can have been mislead by the language in a memorandum that authorizes the dismissal of the coordinators of fathers. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memorandum used the &quot;excess&quot; word to describe the action, even though &quot;surplus&quot; describes with bigger frequency the act of transferring a teacher of the payroll of a school to a labor exchange, whose pays are paid through the home office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty and six coordinators of fathers were &quot;dismissed&quot;, says the draft of the complaint,&quot;and not only in surplus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Finished mission, the Congress prepared to arrive to an agreement on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems related that finally republicans and democrats in the Capitol are ready to come to an agreement themselves on something with the raising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All what was needed was that the rebellion had success, that the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi was captured and murdered and the participation of United States arrived to its end. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the Senate is going to consider a resolution, sponsored by the president John Kerry (democratic for Massachusetts), together with the senators John McCain (republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding to the Libyans by its successful rebellion and to the troops of US. for its &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honor to the brave of Libya, when starting to reconstruct its country&quot;, said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> It &quot;is an assertion of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language can seem inoffensive, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy until now. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, the legislators of both matches fought among themselves and with the White Home on the writing of a series of resolutions to pass or to refuse the paper of the soldiers of US. in the mission of the NATO in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain they presented a resolution that authorizes the limited use of military forces of US. in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated in the Camera through a wide margin bipartisan, and that never got to be voted in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day in which the bill was refused in the Camera, the camera also refused a measure that would have cut back the backgrounds for the American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That left the mission of US. in a sort of legislative purgatory - with the Congress troublesome enough as to criticize the handling on the part of Obama of the mission, but not so annoyed as for in fact to mow the grass under its feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Next, the indecision of the Congress was surpassed by the events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered on the 20th of October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The mission of the NATO finished the 31st of October officially. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate could be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee of Foreign Affairs &quot;congratulates to the people of Libya for its tremendous courage and extraordinary endurance to be released to itself same&quot; and &quot;it praises the men and women of the Armed Forces of United States and its members of the coalition that took part in military operations to protect to the people of Libya for its extraordinary courage and professionalism&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Gain will the complete support of the commission of Foreign Affairs the new measure, or will it divide up the legislators as he did the bill of June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The last version was refused by the senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main republican of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The spokesman of Lugar said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> At the other side of the Capitol, the Camera is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority almost for all the republican congress members and some democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, sponsored by the republican Bob Goodlatte (republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that in fact achieves a poll of all the assembly in the Camera or the Senate in this Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have not had success up to the moment to make its amendments to the assembly arrive, but not for lack of attempts. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> That of Goodlatte is alone one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which include a wide range of subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are duplicates - the same bill is suggested in the Camera as well as in the Senate - and others with slight variances among themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance that is so alone in the Camera, and another handful that will &quot;control the federal expense at least &quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of those bills are also identical among themselves, but give to its sponsors - especially beginner republicans that look for refining its curricula - the opportunity of boasting that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Law of Control of Budget, which was passed in August, the Camera as well as the Senate voting required an amendment of the budgetary balance. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a not binding resolution that supports the idea about that amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that the members of the Congress can comply with, whereas the representative José E. Highland (democrat for New York), wants to take away the limit of two mandates for the presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democrat for Illinois) he has suggested a series of amendments that guarantee the law to an education of quality and sanitary attention, among other subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment that the homosexual marriage forbids is an everlasting proposal, thus as one that forbids the burning of flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of the federal statutes if they are refused by two thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So enthusiastic that they have been the members at the time of suggesting amendments, are not moving to a rhythm more quickly than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, the legislators suggested 77 modifications, and presented 66 in the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The rhythm is unacceptable in comparison with that of the decade of 1990, when the members presented more than 150 amendments regularly every two years, according to ciphers provided by the Library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they did not have much more success then than they have now. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment that was added - on the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but it was in fact suggested by the Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Knocked but not defeated,&quot; Giffords talks in its first interview in TV from the firing </seg>
<seg id="1418"> That ten months people afterwards of a gunman shooting it point-blank in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democratic for Arizona) appeared in the national television the night of Monday, sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway &quot;The sun will rise tomorrow&quot; and said that she wanted to recover more than it wanted to go back to the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In its appearance in ABC News &quot;20/20&quot;, with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The program documented its difficult path of turn of the damages caused by a bale that fractured the skull to him and perforated the left side of its brain, and that I pass from the front up to the subsequent part of its head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, it turned the Camera candid to emit its triumphant vote in the agreement of the ceiling of debt. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In its first television interview from the firing of January, which killed to six and hurt to 13, Giffords smiled, itself rio and sang - and it described its recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked him how he feels, Giffords, of 41 years, answered: &quot;Quite well&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Giffords and its husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, belonged to a special program of &quot;20/20&quot; of an hour of duration, which was emitted the vespers of the publication of the new book of the couple, &quot;Gabby: A history of courage and expectation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords from the firing of the 8th of January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, it sees it to himself in its bed of hospital, with the shaved head and a long scar going through its forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She can only hold one or two fingers raised, while its husband cheers her up. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, is seen to Giffords seated in a wheelchair while the therapists show it how to carry out simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A movement of head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A gathering of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And, afterwards its first word: &quot;What&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> On few days, Giffords pronounced another word - &quot;toast&quot;, an application for change in its menu of breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos spread by ABC show that the music played a central paper in the recovery of Giffords: The congress woman is seen singing the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; of Cyndi Lauper and &quot;Free Falling of Tom Petty&quot; together with the therapists. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours of therapy ago all the days, said that does not remember the day of the firing. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Its husband said that he was reading an article of the newspaper for Giffords on the murder of the 12th of March when she stopped it to ask about first time about the six that had died in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a prison of Missouri and medication is being administered to him for the force while he waits for judgment. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people died&quot;, told Giffords To Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told Sawyer that in a moment of the recovery of its wife, she said: &quot;I have been defeated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;Like this that,&quot; I said it, &quot;Gabby, you have not been defeated,&apos;&quot; said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> &quot;So alone you have been hit. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you are going to go out of this, and are going to recover yourself and are going to return with more force than ever.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> The troops make more pity that I respect feel </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a soiree of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for the homeless veterans in New York. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad on the impotence, the frustration and the leak. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> In that moment, several hundreds of, seafaring soldiers, pilots and infantes of navy they broke into its posts about it. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The formal crowd set standing and they applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women were considered as heroes&quot;, said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of backgrounds of spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A military officer of high range in the soiree, also known as the then president of the Joint Staff, the admiral Mike Mullen, saw the paper of the troops differently. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They showed them as a sort of orphan child&quot;, wrote the officer in an electronic mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure of the organizers having good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Itself that they had them. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it was not respect, real. It was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relation that hold has been taken of the soldiers and an American public often distant, sometimes, worshipper. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> It is lavished on the troops with praises for its sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has a price, say the members of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public every time acts more as if it felt sorry for those ones made uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not casualties at all&quot;, said the general of brigade Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon it will set off towards Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way that some show its support is to put us to us in the paper of helpless souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The subject is a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, that they do not want to seem ungrateful or in disagreement with the public to whom they act. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also realize that the wrath that the troops faced that went back in the last years of the war of Vietnam was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As result, most of the conversations about the pity are carried out in silence and in private among the veterans of war. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After its two children went back of fighting with the Infantry of Navy, the withdrawn colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the people would consider its service apart from the soldiers from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgent ones and traveled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would wonder whether there was an &quot;angry and violent veteran under the surface&quot;, said Cancian, which fought in Iraq and went back to a work of high level of the government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During its job search, it said, felt that some interviewers had asked her subtly whether it would be capable of lasting under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after its tour of combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about your service, you need to face the negative impressions&quot;, remembered Cancian telling it to its children. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military unrest, partially, of the American indifference towards the wars rises up. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for the praise on the part of a country that has little familiarity with the soldiers and sees few direct profits for the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> We, as nation,&quot; do not value the military heroism any longer in ways that were in a complete way common in the Second World War, &quot;said the general lieutenant withdrawn David Barno, the one who commanded the troops of US. in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> However, the praises of the politicians and of the public are focused to a large extent in the depth of the suffering of a member of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have held, the number of friends that they have lost or the scope of its injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army confronts an increasing pressure to finish with the rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a historical audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for its supposed passivity in the face of the rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing themselves for the following one. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The welded of first Elizabeth Lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which it says that it was violated by a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was October 2008, and went of return to its barracks in the Air Base Miramar, in the north of San Diego, after the dinner with a friend when it ran into a colleague that took a packet of 12 cans of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her whether he could join in its room to take a glass. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;It sounded a signal of alarm&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> However, the native of Texas left its worry at a side. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought, not, has 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> It &quot;is of Texas&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;Hopefully it had listened to my instincts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> At the few minutes of entering in the room of Lyman, the man was approached to him at the back, throwing it down and violating it, claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, the 18 of November, Lyman and another 27 members of the military staff current and former wait anxiously a judicial decision in a historical judgment that will be celebrated in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide if the demand that have interposed against the exsecretary of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to judgment. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The demand claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the rape generalized among the soldiers, in rape of the constitutional laws of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, A.D., the demand implied at first 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, they all state that were violated or attacked sexually by its colleagues, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or giving adequate justice after the supposed aggressions. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says that it goes to for the staff of the army, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a structure above downward&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people that are in a position to eradicating the culture of the reprisals? The high command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that since February, it has been contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of which they could belong to future demands. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Its strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in a same basket, so to speak, it is going to present several cases, of being necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The equipment of the defense for the Department of Defense, once Neil MacBride has been led by the federal prosecutor, has presented a motion to reject the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defense -in essence, which the soldiers can not be sued by current or former soldiers by the injuries suffered in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> For a sentence of the High Court of 1950 called the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damages suffered by the staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The claimed damages belong to the military service of the plaintiffs&quot;, say the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense refused to doing comments for this article. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> The things have changed since the fifties. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Whereas it is still for the women in combat officially acting forbidden, this distinction is only nominal: The modern wars rarely have the lines of the front clear. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In Iraq as well as in Afghanistan, the equipments of women welded are having every time more important papers, especially to arrive to the local women in areas of war. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between those two wars, 150 women welded have dead man and two thirds of them in situations of combat. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is hour that the army is also modernized, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> It is not alone in its fight, and another three demands are in progress, besides of the his. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> In the Faculty of Law of Yale, the Private Hospital of Legal Services for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for supposedly to promote a misogynous atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the organization without Vietnam profit motive Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of &quot;disorder of the personality&quot; assigned to the casualties of rape in order to give them the discharge of the service -a common event, according to the activists, as Anu Bhagwati de la Red de Acción de Mujeres in Service, a group of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Its group presented a demand in December against the Administration of Veterans, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way in which it handles the claims of profits for the people who make out that they have been attacked sexually in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine bills have been presented separately in the Congress on the part of a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, suggesting a series of corrections. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual aggressions denounced, according to the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual Aggression and Answer of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> However, the aggressions are notably infra-denounced, and for the estimations of Pentagon themselves, that cipher in approximately 13.5 per cent of the 19000 estimated incidents that took place that year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, published in March, also examines the indexes of processing: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases denounced in the army was to judgment - the half that in the system of civil justice. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, describe its attacks as alone the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, it reported the supposed rape to the military police that less than one hour people afterwards of its happening. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, says, it was asked for it to count the details of its rape 11 different times to a crowd of policewomen, medical, and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She submitted to a kit of rape, and the blood of its aggressor -of a cut in its arm- was found in its bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months afterwards, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which it was asked to him about his having had sexual intercourse with its boyfriend on day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people declared as witnesses of personality on behalf of the supposed author, that he was finally absolved. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;Memory the day in which the verdict was read&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought that I was going to go to the work -I found shouting from the room.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;They put me in the unit of psychiatry, and when I went out, memory that I told it to my officer of command, &quot;That was not its judgment. That was my judgment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, by whom finally it was diagnosed with a disorder of the personality, which made it not suitable for the service, to. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 it was exempted from the service under terms less-that-honorable, what prevents it from receiving any profit. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> As for if the case presented by Lyman and its colleagues of demand continues, is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Law in the Faculty of Law George Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, it indicates, &quot;In my opinion,&quot; they should be capable of following ahead. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What comes between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have been a permanent reviewer of the Doctrine Feres. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades at the back because it does not have the same incentive and dissuasion that poses the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And he adds: The probabilities are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things alone change when the good people are ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the audience does not go through its path, Burke, lawyer of the plaintiffs, she will put its other hundreds of plaintiffs at the queue for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We are going to keep fighting against the army in this subject until the reform is produced&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;O until we die, what happens first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: How are the investigators studying you in Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before converting in the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired its online anti-immigration points of view. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who admitted having carried out a killing in Norway in July, who left 77 dead people, faced its first public judicial audience. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik can have acted alone, was far from being alone in the cyberspace: He had passed most of the time that it preceded to its attack in front of its computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists that they support to the right-wing groups in social nets. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the investigators wanted to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy - you only have to enter Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that it was not so difficult to arrive to them&quot;, says Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently on the European digital populism through the British center of studies DEMOS. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The consignment of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, which the investigators could simply use the tool of publicity to determine its desired demographical characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that the vendors have been using for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The equipment of Bartlett found half a million of fans of the right-wing groups in all Europe and advertisements then directed them, but instead of linking them to a new band or product of diet, the advertisements invited the users to complete an enquiry that he asked on its educational level, attitudes towards the violence and the optimism around its own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> When arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and its colleagues they were capable of studying more than 10,000 followers of 14 matches of extreme right in 11 European countries - everything without going out from the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> It &quot;is a totally new way of doing a research&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not in a complete way surprising: The online partisans of the right-wing groups tend to be young, men and annoyed by the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> However, in a sort of gyration, &quot;those that combine its activism in accordance with the off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that stay behind the screen of the computer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work of DEMOS is alone an example of how Facebook is converting in a new and important tool in the hands of the scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Centers of research, political medical and scientific investigators are using the place to study everything, from problems of health to social trends as they are expressed in the &quot;Likes&quot; me, messages in the walls and updates of state. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million lively users adding a three-piece average of contents per day, the &quot;supernova of data&quot; of Facebook is generating an apogee of the research, giving even almost impulse to the number of academic works with the name of the place in the bond 800% in the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some investigators, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people that you could not approach with a folder in the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you tried to interview people of the British National Match, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You should go through the match, and they would never allow you the access&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook eliminates everything that - you go to them directly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the place could provide a way of identifying and tackling the problems of health-social. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its colleagues, carried out by the doctor found that the university students that talked about its deeds of drunkenness in Facebook had a significantly bigger risk to have problems with the drink that the students that remained in silence on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Sun tan suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the residential advisers, could control the place and take part to help a student that publishes too many updates of state with its drunkenness. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can not deal a problem if you can not diagnose it&quot;, said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Sun Tan and director of the Center of Health, Behavior and Development of the Child in the Institute of Infantile Research of Seattle, said Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way of identifying children in risk that in another way would not be diagnosed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook is also constantly &quot;pricking&quot; to its own population to obtain data. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The Equipment of Data of the place has elaborated statistics on the state of the relation and the Day of San Valentín, the expectation of electoral participation to half of the legislative period of 2010, and an index of National Happiness (mainly using the information that can be accessed - defenders of the digital freedom a lot of time ago that they hold that the place should put availably its great quantity of data of others for the research). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> However, the users of Facebook know that the place is keeping them watch, likes them or not - the sacrifice for being able to play the Scrabble with a friend at thousands of kilometers of distance is to allow the place to undermine your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what does he pass when the users of Facebook pass to be part of an enquiry that they not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Whereas the investigators have clear cut guidelines about how to comprise its off-line data, it is some free drinks online for all of them. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not think that many of the users have thought at least in the fact that an investigator could be examining its profiles&quot;, says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a study of 2006 that carried out with the public walls of Facebook of students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;In what to them concerned, was only between them and its friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Afterwards the question of the methodology is. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even off-line, there is not accountability of which a subject of research this being completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> In Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information of the profile of a user and of the messages of the wall are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say in Facebook and what you make out of Facebook are two completely different things&quot;, says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> It is because of that that, in spite of its years as investigator of the technology, Selwyn thinks that a paper clip and a pen keep being the best tools of research that nobody can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is not substitute to enter in the real world and to talk with the real people &quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;By the social research it is meant that it is on what is social - and a heap of what is social still happens off-line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik does its first public appearance in the court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself to itself as a combatant of the &quot;endurance&quot; during its first public appearance in the court of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian movement of endurance and in the Templars Gentlemen of Norway&quot;, said in front of a full room with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> I oppose to the court, since it received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of the hatred and because supports the multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I recognize the facts but do not declare guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because &quot;he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity of using this audience as a platform so that he expresses its points of view&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he refused to allowing Breivik, which brought a speech written beforehand, to go to the relatives of its casualties at the end of the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered the police to maintain Breivik under custody for 12 more weeks, forbade her the access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have a strict control on all the visits and the correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and relatives of the casualties attended the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came with the expectation to look at Breivik to the eyes, others to confirm that it is confined under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> They all attended with the aim of advancing towards the conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought that it seemed cold and inhuman&quot;, told a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcasting station NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> It &quot;was uncomfortable, but for me was a crossing ahead after seeing and hearing to the suspicious one.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed with a dark dress and blue tie, Breivik remained soothed and professional throughout the audience and looked to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when entered and went out from the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In spite of the strange notion of Breivik of belonging to a movement of bigger &quot;endurance&quot;, the judge determined that is not one ill mental, and said that there are not proofs that it acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is possible that the attacks of the 22 of July seeming comforts them to some to be a work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not soften automatically the pain and the confusion that a whole nation still sits. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;It would please me that seemed a monster, but&quot; does not &quot;seem&quot; it, said a relative of a casualty. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> It would &quot;be much easier if it seemed it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 Lessons of the interview lost of Steve Jobs, are shown in a theater this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs, on the 5th of October, there were some that compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of the technology as the Big Modern Inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But, in a recently rediscovered interview to Jobs to which it has been dusted off as advancement of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, it is what the fans of Apple could find more revealing how much it understood this creative mind about the commercial processes and workflows of the products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was undoubtedly a designer, dreamer and autorreconocido hippy, but was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of the flowcharts - a man that thought that many executives suffered &quot;an illness that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] there is an enormous quantity of work between a great idea and a big product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the series of television The Triumph of the Nerds (The triumph of the idiots) on the dawns of the personal computer, and sat during more than one hour with Jobs for a large and strange conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> In that moment they had scarcely passed 10 years since Jobs had been obliged to leaving of Apple, and he already worked intensely in its new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> Whereas a small part of the interview of Cringely was used in Nerds, it said that the originals of the interview disappeared during its transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was that a complete copy was discovered in VHS in the garage of the director only after the death of Jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This material of file, slightly reedited, is the base of Steve Jobs: The interview lost, of 68 minutes, that it arrives to the cinemas Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For somebody known because he hates the in-depth interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly here ready to expose its technological philosophies and commercial strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And very thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences among the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is weighing up clearly its thoughts, looking for accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments in which the perfectionism of Jobs comes out to the surface, where it seems impatient due to the questions of Cringely, pushing him to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of bigger importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is interview lost, when Jobs evaluates what he sees that other companies do well and badly, and offers its own vision of the future of the computer science, a little strangely prophetic in La. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> A thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the career of Jobs, but there is, the anxious dreamer at the edge of the greatness, in the Jobs that we see here a little raw and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> It has a vision of as they can and they must be the things. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Not a lot after explaining everything with detail here, it was and made it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A fast summary of seven remarkable scenes of La interviews lost: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> About how learning to take a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;Throughout the years in the business, I always asked: &quot;Why you do things?&quot; and the answers that they give you invariably are: &quot;Oh, that is alone the way as it&quot; is &quot;done&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows why it does what does, in the businesses nobody thinks in the things very deeply. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs takes in a retail way its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Disconcerted by the form in were registered the costs - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that was done roughly of good cubero, and that afterwards adjusted with a &quot;variable&quot; - an automated factory that assured that they could determine developed the retail commercial costs. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the joke to the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs tells the &quot;Caja Blue&quot; that it himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed to the hackear people effectively the telephone company and to do free long-distance calls. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> It has been written widely about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here as it describes the Blue Box as an act of empoderamiento is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> The box describes how it and Wozniak proved through the use of a public telephone, doing a call, and being connected afterwards from a net of AT &amp; T to another, while it created a loop with the biggest possible quantity of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We were wrapping the things around the world a dozen average of times and you shouted through the public telephone and it returned a minute later to the public telephone of the door nearby&quot;, says Jobs with a laugh. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and what we learned was that we ourselves could build something that it could control thousands of millions of dollars in infrastructure in all the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The two of us, did not know much, but, we, could build a small thing that could control a gigantic thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I do not think that there had ever been Apple without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that it and Wozniak almost give up, calling the Vatican through the Box Blue in half of the night and requesting to talk with the Pope, while he did its best imitation of Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several members of the catholic hierarchy were called for in half of the night to talk with the American diplomat, they both exploded in laughs that it right before of the very same Pope being woken up to go to answer the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> About falling in love with the technology (and the sale for telephone with Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At 12 years, to the hunt of spare parts to build a frequency counter, of age looked for Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and did a call to him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Little after its telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs obtained an employment of summer at intermediate time in Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well dealt its employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs was converted afterwards in one of the employees of HP that visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first computer of table never made&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as big as a suitcase was, it had a small screen of cathodic tube, and I fell in love with it. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> He would obtain a journey up to HP as adolescent and would waste time with that machine and would write programs for it. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> About improvising the innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products along the way. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Soon in its career, since it dedicated itself to selling a handful of motherboards, a customer asked him whether he could assemble all the equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working with one alone 30 days of loan, he had to find out the assembling and the delivery of the completed devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, while it was in Apple, it remembers the fights that it faced in the development of a mouse of computer: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember to have dramatic arguments... they shouted me that five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars] would be needed, and I was tiring and was myself outside and found a designer. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days afterwards, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was totally reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On the big businesses losing he forces: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> That it a lot before of it leading the renaissance of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the form in which many leaders of the industry would run in its vision, and would lose the control of its market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Say that you work in IBM or Xerox, therefore you make photocopying machines and better printers, and what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market share, therefore the company does not have more success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The sales departments and marketing increase the success, therefore the ones that they finish because they manage the companies and the people responsible for the products are expelled from the forum for the decision making are this class of people. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Products - the knowledge of the necessary profession. are rotted by the genius of the products that it took to that position of monopoly because of people that do not have the notion of good products bad vs </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what he passed in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have taken possession of all the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could have been ten times its size, could have been the Microsoft of the nineties... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They took the defeat of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On the innovation as artistic expression: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is an enormous quantity of work between a great idea and a big product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and it grows.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> It is learned a lot about the fineness of it. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that you can not do that they do the electrons, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories make them. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> It has to hold 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - to adjust all at the same time... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> In the end everything is reduced to the taste - itself lowering to try maybe to expose you that an equipment of human beings has done, and afterwards to try to adapt those things to which your you are doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that the good artists copy, the big artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have never had shame about stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> What partially did big To the Macintosh was that the people that were working in it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, that casually were the best computer scientists of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it were not for the computer science, it could be making marvelous things in other fields. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with the competitors of the law of sanitary assistance while the court accepts the case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day that was brought together behind closed doors by the Supreme Court to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to the law of sanitary assistance of the president Obama, two of its magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, they were overwhelmed in a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers that will expose the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The occasion was the last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary audience to study the requests of revision in a detailed way. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question was a demand presented by 26 states challenging the total reform of the sanitary assistance approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for the preserving activists in all the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The magistrates agreed to admit the demand to formality and, in fact, a historical plea of 5 hours and average for March are waited, and the result will still probably muddy the presidential career of 2012, which will be whole apogee in the moment in which the decision of the court is known, more. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer that will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discarded will be probably Paul Clement, the one who served as attorney general of US. during the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The firm of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozens of companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that it takes many years dedicated to the defense of the preserving legal beginnings. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents to one of the trade associations that the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, challenged. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., that it has an enormous financial interest in the result of the litigation. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was celebrated in a hotel of Washington, hours after the preliminary audience of the court on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Among the assistants the most important republican in the Senate and an opponent was declared of sanitary assistance of the law, among others, Mitch McConnell. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The special guests in the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> It is not at all new: Both judges have been attending to events of the Federalist Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical norms. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that rules the actions of the inferior federal magistrates. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were not it, it could be said that 4 C, which he says, would fall under the Canon Code: &quot;A judge can attend to events to raise backgrounds of related organizations with the law and others, although the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear in the program of such an event. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the absolute nearness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the offices of lawyers in the case, as well as to a company with an enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm the activists of ethics in the government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This impressive gap of the ethics and indifference towards the code goes to all the federal judges against the demands for several magistrates that the court abides by for the same rules that are applied&quot;, said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause). </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were overwhelmed in a collection of full backgrounds with lawyers that have pending cases before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Its appearance and assistance in the collection of backgrounds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that say that they mix too easily the activity of the court with the agenda given impulse by groups as the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a distinguished preserving activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> On the other hand, the conservatives argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, the one that has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan worked as general attorney of the administration Obama when the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first application were presented. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Its reviewers have pressed so that Kagan is abstained of seeing the case, saying that it was too much involved in defending the law as for now to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has not given any indication that it is going to make it. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing receives a record of 18 asked for a billion dollars </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The airline Emirates asks for 50 airplanes of double corridor Boeing 777, with option to 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sells six airplanes Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than a thousand a million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is rarely a news when a company obtains an order of 50 units of its product. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But is a great transaction when the company is the manufacturer of airplanes Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 airplanes promotes to a record of 18 a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is as big as the place of where Boeing received the order is: Middle East, a mine of gold in growth of future orders of airplanes. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a study introduced on Monday, the company of Chicago estimates that during the next 20 years the airlines in Middle East will need 2,520 airplanes for value 450 a billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced during the weekend its greatest order of the history for commercial airplanes for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 of double corridor. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The successful wine of the airline Emirates in Dubái asked for. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> The airline also has an option to buy 20 airplanes more, which would raise the total selling price to 26 a billion dollars, announced Boeing in the Aeronautical Room of Dubái 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Afterwards, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked for six Boeing 787-8 sec, the called Dreamliner, that boasts about a saving of fuel and some services for spectacular passengers. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The selling price for six of them is more than a thousand a million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This has clearly an enormous positive effect for Boeing&quot;, said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these customers particularly is very strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines of Middle East are an estate of its nations producing of oil. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore, they not only have the money to pay the airplanes, but an increase in the prices of the fuel - as a rule harmful to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is gaining money with the increase of the price of the oil. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> That is important because they have less probabilities than other airlines of canceling or deferring the orders to flight when the prices of the fuel increase, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural protection&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the market of airplanes of wide fuselage and helps SAS of invading its domination with the airplane of passengers A350 the attempt at its competitor Airbus hold stripe. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of Boeing in the airborne fair takes place that it four months afterwards of Airbus saying that was going to defer A350, which competes directly with the 777-300 ER, the debut of the biggest. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> It deferred the debut to add more impulse after the customers demanded an increase of the actual load and of the range. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The actions of Boeing co raised 1.5% up to 67.94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the poll of Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa María Calderón states that the drug dealers helped its opponent of the PRI, Pomp Vallejo, in the conflict for governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of the president Felipe Calderón seems to have lost its candidacy to governor of Michoacán during the choices of the violent state, and it stated the Monday that the drug dealers helped incline the career in favor of one of its opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The preliminary results gave to Pomp Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Match, or TO PRI the front in the career for governor of the occidental state. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The intervention of the crime organized during all the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not alone for Michoacán, but for all the country&quot;, said Luisa María Calderón in an interview of radius a day after the poll of Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, to our electoral workers... They took hold of the urns, installed barricades... and they ordered the people to vote&quot; in favor of the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI governed Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> However, it is the staging of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important crossing in that effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI has the expectation to win the presidential choices in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to have surpassed for little margin to Fermata, the one who had led the enquiries before the choices. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Fermata, a candidate of the preserving Match of National Action of its brother, or BREAD, refused to recognizing Vallejo as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Match, or PRD, which at present occupies the charge of governor, remained in the third place, a great defeat for the left divided up and unfortunate before the presidential choices of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> You also aureoles was denied to recognize the preliminary results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, exmayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with the drugs traffic and urged the other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacán has been for a lot of time dominated by cartels of the drug specialized in marihuana, heroine and metanfetaminas. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the natal state of the Fermata president, and he chose Michoacán to launch a directed military offensive against the dealers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> However the violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A mayor of the BREAD was murdered a week before the choices while he did campaign for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates gave up the local candidacies for fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Although for the PRI, for unpleasant that the choices of Michoacán seem, a victory will help give impulse to the match. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man that is meant will represent the PRI in the presidential choices, Enrique Peña Nieto, talking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: &quot;I believe that this victory should be very encouraging, of towards the next year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The BAsD urges Asia to help the Euro-area rescue </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Bank of Development (BAsD) has done a call to India and China so that they are prepared to help rescue the Euro-area of its crisis of sovereign debt to prevent a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of the Asian economics. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, chief operating officer of the Asian Bank of Development with headquarters in Manila, said that the two great economics of faster growth of the world had that to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already was across the Background Monetary Internationally or directly through bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He noticed against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in an &quot;impartial&quot; way and said that the financing assistance of Asia together with the leadership and European resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economics. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> We all &quot;are joint in this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So any that can help Europe go out of the crisis is useful&quot;, told to the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the Economic Forum World Championship in Bombay. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia can be protected in a certain measure, but can not be immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, that it is by all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> The European monetary union has been seen severely undermined by a crisis of sovereign debt in the last months. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> On the last days, the costs of indebtedness of Italy have gone off dangerously and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The current crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the world economics to the recession and has generated calls so that the main emergent economics join to help the Euro-area find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag predicted that any support of Asia would be canalized across the FMI, but said that the bilateral assistance - as the purchase of the bonds of the background of ransom of the EU, the European Background of financial stability - it offered a bigger bargaining power for the Asian members of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, Indian minister of Comercio, said that &quot;India is going to make everything possible&quot; to the Euro-area to help since its own economics now was suffering the fall of the exports and the depletion of the entries of foreign asset. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants for the Euro-area to keep being unstable and turbulent&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have monumental challenges and have to hold a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not an option, is an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that the expanding economies as India do not have responsibility in helping the rich Europeans when they face its own and deep economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, professor of the University of Brown in the US., said that selling the help to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand would be politically very difficult people of India, of which up to 800 million live with nearly 2 dollars per day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;In some moment they will realize that the Greeks are retired at the age of 50 years and they are gone on holiday to the beaches and that will not fall well&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> It reads Howell, general manager of the Economic World Forum, also wondered why the reservations of India had to be used to maintain the numerous and well remunerated workers of the Greek public sector, in jobs of companies badly administered, and generating of leaks as the railroads. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Nag said that the crisis of the Euro-area threatens &quot;important chain effects&quot; through all Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The prediction of the Asian Bank of Development of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 faces now the &quot;falling risks&quot; due to the threat of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He said that the vulnerable emergent markets needed to do &quot;plans of contingency&quot; to be protected from a crisis and significant exits of capital of its economics. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Serious notices of the Pentagon about the possible cutbacks in defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The secretary of Defense, León Panetta, warmed up the Congress on Monday, noticing that the automatic cutbacks of budget that approach could undermine the national safety and provoke a financial chain reaction from the corridors of Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Pentagon is already the 450 digesting a billion dollars of reductions throughout the next decade, but now fears a billion or more in cutbacks that it can be imminent if the Congress does not manage to arrive to an agreement on the expense an additional reduction of 600. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cutbacks would be devastating for the department&quot;, Panetta said in a card to the senators John McCain, republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, republican for Carolina del Sur. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> It said that the failure of the Congress to arrive to an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the called &quot;kidnapping&quot;, would give rise to 23 per cent of global reductions and one high to many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A cutback that was so big, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make the oldest part of our naval projects and of construction not be able to be executed - three fourth parts of a boat or a building can not be bought - and damage seriously other efforts of modernization&quot;, wrote Panetta to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> We would also see ourselves obliged to putting many of our civil civil servants aside involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed with so much rapidity, it is almost safe that we should license civil in order to comply the goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would break the faith with those that maintain our army and would damage seriously the good arrangement.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cutbacks with the time would reach to the troops of combat, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although the financing for times of war in the accounts of Operations of contingency in overseas is not seen directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be seen affected negatively by the severe disorders in the budgets of base&quot;, noticed Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The personnel contract would be reduced, what would take to delays in the contracts and the monitoring of the contract that supports the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff in payroll would be reduced, giving rise to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Both senators had written To Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cutbacks in the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would provoke a fast decline of the United States as main military power of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are firmly against this Draconian action&quot;, said the senators in a joint communique the afternoon of Monday when they published the card of Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not a result with which it can be lived, and certainly is not one that we must impose ourselves on ourselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The kidnapping is a threat for the interests of the national safety of the United States, and it must not be allowed it to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> If the card of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary appointment or will intensify the calls to exempt to the Pentagon of the cutbacks it is because it sees. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been every time franker on the possible cutbacks, even though it arrived to a work in the summit of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White Home and knowing that it faced difficult decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> In a press conference last week, the secretary of Defense painted a gloomy panorama of what could be in front - an army with a shell, but not a kernel. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> It &quot;is a boat without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> It &quot;is a brigade without bales.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> It &quot;is an air wing without sufficient trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> It &quot;is a tiger of paper, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficient soldiers enabled to comply the mission&quot;, said Panetta in its words of opening in Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It &quot;is a force that suffers the moral decrease, the deficient preparation and is not capable of being maintained to the day with the opposing potentials.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;In effect, it invites to the aggression...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to its cards to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciates new details of how the reductions &quot;generate important operative risks: he delays, conflicts and disasters, in the response time to the crises; it limits severely our capacity to be deployed and committed themselves previously in all the world; and means an unacceptable risk in future operations of combat.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest projects of defense could confront the felling axe, those that are already being proved and some included alone in the first stages of the planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list includes the airplane of combat F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new boat of coastal combat and the new vehicle of combat in earth that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Stopping the development and the additional proofs of the F35 could generate about 80 a billion dollars in savings throughout 10 years, but its partisans say that it is the following vital crossing to improve and to confront the potential threats of China and other competitors. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> As detecting a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look to the most recent headlines indicates us however serious and omnipresent are the deceit and the lie in the daily life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; every part accuses the other one of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The administrators of the State University of Pensilvania have been accused of perjury for supposedly to conceal reports that said that a coach of withdrawn soccer was attacking children sexually. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, the French president, Nicolás Sarkozy, &quot;was caught&quot; with a live microphone stating the president of US., Barack Obama, who the first Israeli minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The congress man for New York and exhibitionist in Internet, Anthony Weiner, did the ridicule with his denied quickly rebutted by the indisputable proof. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The presidential ex candidate John Edwards has been accused of related infractions in the financing of the campaign with the concealment of an extramarital relation. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And, again, nobody who lived it will ever forget the media circus untied by the president Bill Clinton when lying during its second mandate about its sexual relation with Mónica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The legends are very extended on the catches in the examinations of the school and the university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Cases have occurred in which the professors have given the answers of the examinations to the students in order to be better seen in its evaluations of yield. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who should be showing the opposite are sending the message that to lie and to cheat they are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deceit do we find? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On any day, the studies show that they can lie to you in any place of 10 to 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> That safe, many of those lies are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that the strangers lay three times in the first 10 minutes of being known. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> To detect lies, or &quot;the location of lies&quot;, is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for personal as well as professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a similar table game to, for example, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim: &quot;I have&quot; you, the detection of the deceit is a branch of the knowledge serious based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out projects of research in depth, especially in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie have been rebutted. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Yes the liars look to the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They not always stammer, mutter, blush or are worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> It can not be concluded either that the liars are difficult to detect or to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A detector of lies trained can arrive to the truth learning the formation of questions and the times about the structure of the declaration, the microfacial expressions. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I passed several years emergent body of the knowledge probing the scientific discoveries on the deceit in the vast one and always, and it was clear that the detection of the deceit is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps sail for our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include the recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars have the skill of reading well those ones, making them feel at ease, handling its own emotions and feeling intuitively how the others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know by the researches that the extrovert ones mention more than the introverts, that the men say more &quot;lies orientated to itself same&quot;, whereas the women tell more lies &quot;orientated to the others&quot; -- normally to protect the feelings of somebody -- that the married people lie less frequently at its couples than the people that are not married (but the lies that say usually tend to be &quot;enormous&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, the others will feel less guilty when lying to him. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How to know if somebody is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, observe the usual behavior of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &quot;to create a base line&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It helps provide points of reference to measure afterwards the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the posture of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is better that he knows whether anybody normally bangs with the foot all the time not to make accusations unfair when he sees the feet for him banging in half of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Next, look for misleading, verbal and not verbal groups of behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> It considers to these groups of behavior as signals of alarm, not as it proves of deceit. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The people that trick can freeze the top of the body when trying to remember its history, can note its feet towards the door, to be inclined towards an exit, to change its posture significantly or to exhibit a &quot;postinterview comfort&quot; -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have finished. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Often the interrogators make see falsely it alone that the interview has finished to look for that postinterview relief. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> He also pays attention to the vocabulary of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Scott Peterson blundered up to the background and used the time passed while he stated that its murdered wife was alive, launching a search of it at national level. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The people that they trick also can use a distanciador language: &quot;I did not have sexual intercourse with that woman... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or to repeat a difficult question in a complete way. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Somebody can use a heap of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when he answers to a difficult question: &quot;Good... to say truth... up to what I he... to my to understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This makes the answer be a perception instead of a fact and that is often a signal of alert. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is not any magical formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to discover the deceit is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the possibilities of any to prevent to be victimized by the artists of the swindle in its professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan of the oil pipeline diverted after the threat of the delay of US. in its approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Days after the administration of Obama threatened with deferring the approval of an oil pipeline planned from Canada up to Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating to the trade unions, while it calmed the ecologists -- the company that looks for building the oil pipeline says that it is ready to redirect the project to channel it again. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said on Monday at night that it will move the planned oil pipeline out of the area of Sandhills in an ecological way sensitive in Nebraska, and the approval trusts that the project will gain. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision in the press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The manager of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence in which the oil pipeline is approved with time, although it is true that with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This comes after the advertisement the week passed by a federal license on the part of the Department of State that they would defer the decision for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the aquifer Ogallala, a vast water supply underground. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real way of progress&quot;, the representative said Lee Terry, republican of Nebraska, to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental revision ordered by the Department of State is possible that separately any decision up to 2013, after the choices of the next year, although the civil servants denied that the policy was wrapped in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a declaration written last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all its support to them. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The oil pipeline, of 1,700 kilometers would extend from Canada up to Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would take 700,000 barrels per day of the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> For that, it would be necessary that it crossed six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> It is hated by the ecologists, but is loved by the work groups, which they have bet for the estimation of 20,000 jobs linked to the oil pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are weighing up the legislation to force a distance from the region of Sandhills and from the aquifer Ogallala, the biggest fountain of potable water and of irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The current environmental impact statement of the Department of State found that the project alone posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the fountain of the energetic industry said that the general inspector of the department has ordered an independent proof of the process of revision, focusing on two questions. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is if the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was an advisor of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a clash of interests for the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other one is if a firm that was hired to manage the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti sued LaBelle for supposedly to provoke that a child vomited scary </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York states that the diva of the disk music, Patti LaBelle, behaved as a madwoman in the hall of its building of Manhattan, terrifying its small daughter up to the point that she vomited scary. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade of the singer of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; frightened to Genevieve Monk, of 18 months of age, so much that it suffered &quot;changes of personality, disorders of the dream&quot; and &quot;increased its fear to the strange ones&quot;, says its family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was the 10th of November of the year passed when the stagehand Kevin Monk, its wife, Roseanna, professor of kindergarten, and Genevieve were being prepared to go to a familiar journey. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk caught the car, Roseanna Monk lowered to the hall of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with its luggage, taking Genevieve. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said that it stopped near the door and put its daughter in the ground for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Somebody approached for behind and said me,&quot; You know what is doing your daughter?&apos; &quot;I said it yes &apos;and I went to catch it&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman annoyed. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;It said in an aggressive pitch, &quot;Should not have left to its daughter near the door &quot;, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I said it, &quot;I do not have any interest in what you say or thinks&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> It was infuriated and started to use bad words - the word C and the word J in voice discharge... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> It had a bottle of water and started to throw the water of the bottle on me.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1853"> He said that Genevieve put hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said it to this woman, &quot;Look what you have made it to my daughter&quot;, said the mother of the girl. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle pounced on the mother -- which still held to Genevieve -- and it had to be contained by its environment and withdrawal to a car that waited it, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The small one was crying so strong that it vomited, added. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology of LaBelle, but she did not obtain answer. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment the happened. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The demand looks for unspecified damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he caught the case of a free form and that the family plans to donate all the money that he obtains to an association of support to the children with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The purpose is to do to Patti responsible LaBelle of its behavior&quot;, said Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;That type of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed to a teacher of kindergarten that takes in the arms to a child in 18 months of age.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Climatic adversity stopped the economics </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa he has increased the unemployment and the informality, it brought the foreign inversion down and the economics contracted </seg>
<seg id="1864"> The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is about the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, selfnamed of the change, which generated great expectations with regard to the advances in the economics, but the climatic adversity of beginning of year given, growth is not observed, however yes a deterioration is registered in the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures of February, besides causing millionaires leaks for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economics to grow, caused a contraction of the economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first semester of the year, justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in the agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors, mainly. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report of affectations for the freezes, Mexican for the Rural Development Sustentable emitted by the Board, damages were had in 582 a thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main impaired crops were those of vegetables, corn and chickpea. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The fall in the economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase of the unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography by the rate of state evacuation during the three first quarters of the year a fast growth was observed, since while of January to March 55 a thousand 053 sinaloenses were emptied, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Population Económicamente Activa, for the second quarter the rate passed to be 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued being increased even 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of people throws a thousand unemployed sinaloenses to more than 74, an increase with regard to the first semester of 18 a thousand 969 individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Smaller liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of the evacuation can be explained indirectly, according to the actions that from the public policy have been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What is being seen is a growth of the unemployment that has to do with several factors, among them the leak of liquidity in the market for effects of a restriction of resources for the legislation that was approved in the congress to fight the wash of money, any longer for the people that grabs dollars illicitly it is not it easy that it works them, inverts them and uses them in something&quot;, expressed. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Thorough migration </seg>
<seg id="1872"> López Cervantes indicated that in the increase in the unemployment there is also a demographical factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people that it leaves the state in search of work abroad, in United States it has been restricted, first for the difficulties to enter, and second because already entering they have also many difficulties to find work, those people are being kept and it is demanding fountains of work here in the state, which does that the unemployment&quot; is &quot;increased&quot;, appeared. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Informality </seg>

<seg id="1877"> The monthly admission average of the sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 a thousand 352 pesos, very below the national average, placed in 7 a thousand 375 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Contraction of IED </seg>
<seg id="1879"> United to the fall of the economic activity and by the increase in the unemployment, during 2011 the biggest decrease of the Direct Foreign Inversion of the last 10 years is registered, as the Secretariat of Economics of January to June of the state IED added 630 a thousand 697 dollars, what represents a fall of 87.74 per cent with regard to the 5 million 143 a thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> On its part, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the state Government counts a total inversion of 17 a thousand 280 million pesos in the year, occurred mainly of companies of the tertiary industry. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The debt </seg>
<seg id="1882"> In front of the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the state requested in July to the state congress the approval of a loan for 3 a billion pesos, same that they would be destined the inversion in projects of infrastructure in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economics, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 a thousand 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the profits for the indebtedness in any sector of the state economics. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Reactions </seg>

<seg id="1885"> Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Camera of the Industry of the Transformation, expressed that during 2011 the harmonization of wills of the different sectors was lacked, including the Government of the state itself. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> &quot;The performance of the economics in Sinaloa during this year has been really poverty-stricken, has to work intensely to recover the ground that we lost in this year, in the 2012 we have to redouble efforts, it missed to line up the effort of all and especially the good course already synchronized of this new equipment of Government, we expect next year to be much better&quot;, expressed. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Economic slowness </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Loredo López declared that events as the freezes of beginnings of year stopped the state economics and they restricted its performance and growth. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &quot;The low economic flow is a product of several events, among them the freezes, one of the main effects has been a slow economics that does not give returned fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, to the end of year we are closing very below the expectations that we had&quot;, mentioned. </seg>

<seg id="1891"> For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employer Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he declared that it is required to prosecute the state towards productive activities of bigger dynamism. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> &quot;In general terms we have observed that it has been being worked, we think that developing a long-term program in which the vocation is redefined is necessary and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential is detonated of the material and human resource that has Sinaloa&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> I work because it does </seg>
<seg id="1894"> The president of the Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a vision of future that channels the efforts of the Government better. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> &quot;In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different matters, on the subject of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed&quot;, appeared. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> It indicated that the current administration has shown advances in its way of driving the public policy. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> &quot;There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more incluyente, I what I can say is that there is done work and I think that the Government is conscious that there is work for doing&quot;, expressed. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> They condemn it for 8 kgs of mariguana </seg>
<seg id="1899"> A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of fine for the possession of eight kilos of mariguana. </seg>

<seg id="1904"> He owes contributions for works </seg>
<seg id="1905"> The works of social character contemplated in programs as Hábitat, Ransom of Public Spaces and 3 x 1 for migrantes they are found in risk not to be concluded or to have serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, indicated Miguel Ángel López Miranda. </seg>
<seg id="1906"> The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although until now the programs of work have advanced yes, they are in risk as they have not complied with the Government of the State with the contributions that correspond to him that sink a resource superior to the 11 million pesos in the three programs. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> It indicated in total that the inversion in these three programs is of almost 50 million pesos, of which to the State 25 per cent corresponds and that until now alone the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, for what the possible delay in the conclusion of these is made current. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> They &quot;are almost 12 million what contributing is them due and even though the year is for finishing they have given us not even one fifth, when since July they had to give us a part&quot;, expressed, &quot;we not to hold us up have initiated the works and go very advanced, but the money needs to us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> It mentioned that the year spent, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded them, for what at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a loan to cover the but of 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> &quot;It already spent us in the previous sexenio because the State did not have the economic capacity to take part and the programs kept walking, and this year we to be able to access to these programs had to obtain the resources to cover what left pending the State&quot;, detailed. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Even though there is the appointment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, it commented that the application to the Secretary of Administration and Finances, Armando Villarreal, of speeding up the formalities so that the percentages that correspond to them as soon as possible arrive has been made. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> Cost court &quot;analogical blackout&quot; in Mexico in the 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The replacement of analogical signals for digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the last years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that lodged the Senate and the Camera of Representatives against the presidential decree that advances the called &quot;analogical blackout&quot; from 2021 to 2015, as the eight necessary votes are not brought together to invalidate it. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, included considered that the transition to the digital television was not exceeded in its attributions by the president Felipe Calderón as emitted the decree that details the actions to follow to specify terrestrial. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected because it did not reach the majority qualified as eight votes so that the Court pronounced itself on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains current. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The project of sentence, elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, suggested declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the matters of radius and television is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in breach of the beginnings of hierarchical and standby subordination of law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> In favor of the project Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the Sánchez Cordero herself voted only. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, the Senate as well as the Camera of Representatives promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree, and when admitting the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions in it disposed for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The plenary session of ministers resolved to reject also the demand lodged by the Camera of Representatives, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In its intervention, the president minister made out that he did not coincide with the arguments of the project, in the sense of the federal Executive not being able to structure the measures through general norms so that the public administration is prepared. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I do not consider either that if it did it it would be affected the autonomy of the regulating organ&quot;, and remembered that the gliding of public policies in strategic areas as the sector of telecommunications correspond to the federal Executive, who has by constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The replacement of analogical signals for digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the last years, and means a better exploitation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Postponing the change, held, would be to put off the profits for the digitalization, which implies a decision of public interest, that it does not have only a technical dimension, &quot;for it includes economic questions, social, political and of national safety&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These questions, stood out, &quot;they require the operation of all the system established, as at the beginning of economic rectory of the State, it comprises a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the state Executive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> It remembered that a big number of countries in all the world has already concluded the digital transition, and has made it through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical organs. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It can not be concluded that, when emitting the contested decree, which invades in some form the sphere of competences of the Congress, the observance of the emitted laws is then being provided in the administrative sphere by the Executive for the Legislative, assured. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> They analyze possibility of a &quot;vote&quot; conteo &quot;for vote&quot; in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to the data thrown by the PREP the difference among first and second place of the choice of governor is of hardly 27 for a hundred, still without the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 being counted a thousand 74 total minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of the conteo &quot;vote for vote&quot; is a reality as for the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data thrown by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference among first and second place of the choice of governor is of hardly 27 per cent, still without the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 being counted a thousand 74 total minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> About this, the president of the General Board of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, remembered that some days ago, on the 9th of November, the electoral organ hardly approved a series of lineaments in order to blend the local norms with the federal reform in electoral matter. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> As it will be remembered, Michoacán did not standardize its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Law of Electoral Justice, every time that the Congress of the State approved the reforms little before concluding the legal deadline so that they could come into effect in the present electoral process and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the specified periods in the Law of the Official Newspaper of the State, with the argument that it had some objections. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> The same 9 of November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the state leader to the constitutional reforms, every time that does not have law of sanctioning them or to veto them&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Interviewed &quot;by vote&quot; about the possibility of the &quot;vote&quot;, María de los Ángeles Llanderal exposed that thanks to the approval of the corresponding lineaments on the part of the General Board of the IEM the accomplishment of partial and total countings of the poll will be possible on the part of the local electoral organ. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> That way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packets, will be able to occur in the suppositions that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is not the minute of counting and counting in the dossier of the box or do not act in power of the president of it; or, when there are errors or evident alterations of the minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Besides, the total counting of the poll received in all the boxes of the choice will be able to be carried out when there is indication that the difference between the winning supposed candidate of the choice that it is treated and the that he has obtained the second place in the poll, is equal or smaller to a percentage point; provided at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the match and/or coalition that he postulated to the second of the indicated candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total counting of the poll will also be able to be carried out if when finishing the ordinary counting is established that the difference among the candidate supposedly winning and the one placed in the second place is equal or smaller to a percentage point, provided it exists the request expresses of the representative of the political party whose candidate remained in second place, case in which the electoral packets will be excluded that have been the target of partial counting. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> One may mention that in this situation the choice of Morelia is found, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is of hardly 0.16 per cent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1977"> The designated first minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country at the edge of the economic disaster </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The designated first Italian minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has endangered all the Euro-area. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> A communique of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> It is expected it to present a cabinet composed in the main by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the charge. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said that he will present the president the result of its conversations with the political parties in its attempt to form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country of surpassing this difficult phase&quot;, told the European ex commissioner to journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the pitch of its comments indicated that the obstacles there are been overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The &quot;frame is however delineated&quot;, added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process of forming a government on less than three days, a lot less of what is normal, while Italy fights a political crisis and financing company that has given impulse to the costs of its debt at untenable levels. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration managed by the European ex commissioner Monti must approve a hard packet of austerity demanded by the European leaders to recover the hit confidence in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Underlining the pressure on Monti so that hurries up, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian bonds BTP at 10 years for above of 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were seen obliged to being rescued. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers Confindustria, said the press after meeting Monti: &quot;We told this government that we would support a lot&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We think that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy goes out from this emergency situation. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The possibilities of success of Monti were seen given impulse by the back of the match PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, to whom the crisis obliged to resigning on Saturday, in a considerable way. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> &quot;We think that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to have a good result&quot;, told to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the match of centroderecha. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> The support of the PDL, the biggest match of Italy, is significant because until now the Government of majority had been opposed technocrat who is forming Monti by many of its members. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Parliamentary support </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be unpopular reforms of austerity. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Any blockade or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack of the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> The Italian association of foreign banks was added at the pressure when noticing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti initiated on Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and company groups, as well as with young organizations and of women. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> It will put an end to its round of meetings on Tuesday at night. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has fit out an extremely fast transition in reply to the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> After a brief rest at the end of last week, when clearing that Berlusconi would resign remained, the costs of the Italian debt have returned now to critical levels among the uncertainty about whether the new first minister will have success. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Rescuing to Italy, with one national debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Euro-area. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti has said that its government should last up to the next choices, foreseen for 2013, in spite of the predictions generalized about the politicians only giving it time to apply the reforms before advancing the choices. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti has said that it would like to include politicians in its cabinet, but the big matches insist in that it must be formed only by technicians, an indication of its objections in the face of a process obliged by the financial pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Political fountains indicated that the mutual mistrusts and the entity disagreements the matches are complicating the attempt to include political figures. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> The rub of the Spanish is superior to that of the ticos </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Of the 22 called soccer players of Spain, ten go beyond the 50 international games. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> Of the side of Costa Rica alone one of the 22 ones called for it arrived to the 50 meetings. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if the 22 ones called for by both countries for the friendly one of today are compared, to the 3:05 p. m., in the National Stadium of San Jose. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> While the champions world and of Europe, number one of the monthly ranquin of the FIFA, count a wide record of interselections games of class A, the Tricolor alone has to the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international matches. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> This cipher reached it on the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> The Spanish soccer players that stake in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the League Premier of England, maintain to one intense activity in championships of league and domestic glass, and collisions of high level in European glasses as Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> The experience is added for him to the previous with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifying round of the Euroglass and the World Championship of futbol. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> On the contrary, the ticos soccer players possess an international rub limited in an area, as the Concacaf, which is considered that of lower level in the FIFA. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fallen 0-1 in London) evened the record of the exdoorman Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationality. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Xavi Hernández, cerebral steering wheel of Barcelona, possesses 106. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Boxes and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week for the UEFA beside the other centennials of the Iberian equipment, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Almost near the centennial cipher is Carles Puyol, with 97 games. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Xabi Alonso, with 91, follow him; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Of the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, they are the left lateral one Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> After there, alone five surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The less. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> With more than 30 presentations in Spain Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), appear Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31). </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Of the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appear with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> The rest does not approach at 20. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> While Nacho Moreal alone has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar possesses alone one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson yet do not start out. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> The historical goal scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 centers, followed by Fernando Torres with 27. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers so many with nine more, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more that Roy Myrie and Parks. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Quintet included to the country in its tour of celebration of two decades of trajectory </seg>
<seg id="2030"> &quot;To go to Costa Rica is a dream reality brought about&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2031"> In exclusive interview with Viva, the bass guitar player Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday, in the National Stadium. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> They have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to convert in fact the dream of being due into the country. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Like this it assured it the bass guitar player and charter member, Jeff Ament, who talked in sole right with Viva, from Brazil, last week. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> The group is in the South American wing of its tour of celebration of two decades of work and on Sunday the 20th will do its only scale in Central America. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> That day they will present in the National Stadium, from the 7:30 p. m., beside the band angelina The X and the national ones of Las Robertas. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in La Nación in Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> For its Costa Rican followers, it is a dream reality brought about that Pearl Jam is going to touch in Costa Rica, are its fans conscious of what they are living? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> To go to Costa Rica is a dream reality brought about for us also. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is hardly our second time in South and Central America and until now it has been enormous. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I have been alone in Costa Rica once and of holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think that we are going to be able to stay some days there. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> So it touches us to take our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask it to him because there is a sort of devotion towards the band, the fans live with intensity on the previous days. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do they tell to its most fervent followers? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Graces because they remain at our side through all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It took us almost 21 years to arrive to Costa Rica; graces for having waited so much and we regret that has taken us so much time in arriving up to there. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people even already refer to its concert as the greatest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Add does a little pressure that for him to its visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest shows that we have touched during the last 21 years happened during the last couple of weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We touch a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we expect that to have put us in form for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Really, we are very anxious to be due there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love that country, loves us surfear and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How was it that they discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfear? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have many friends who are surfeadores and I have a big friend who lives in Tamarind and the waves there are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends always left to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, places are big for surfear; it was like this how we find out, through people who love the surf. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> When seeing the tour, they have come delivering enormous shows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have they planned for its presentation in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we have never been due there before, we do then not have any restriction on what we can make. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch a couple of songs of every album and to give our fans a good and different repertory. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertory. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> To what is this due? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that it is partially because we have nine disks and we can touch more than 120 songs and each likes it different songs, so choosing which songs is difficult to be due every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertory which we take while of not touching, that keeps us focused on and it also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons for which we liked those songs and that it could have forgotten for us. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show be more interesting for us and, therefore, I think that it also turns it more interesting for the people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> When looking behind, is it difficult to think all what they have achieved? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> In the first place, I believe that none of us itself imagine that we would be in a big band of rock and to have done it for more than 20 years makes that it seems as a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We keep saying our blessings and it touches us a lot that we can keep doing music joint. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We all want ourselves and we love our creating music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate of going to places of the world to which we always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The things could not be better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What meant for you having belonged basic of the appearance of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honor to belong to that group of big bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice un Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement rises up from a peer group and is something little common. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, a band of a city rises up, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands go out at the same time of a same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honored of belonging to the group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> We still touch with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were in a festival with Alice un Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden in its tour, so we are fortunate of being friends of all of them still and it honors us to belong to that sound of Seattle that rose up. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that by a band as that of you is maintained joined and with the same members for so much time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have we are joint for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) was joined to us 13 years ago, which, by itself alone, is much more time than last many bands. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the first place, I think that we all are fortunate of being still with life and, in second, all we worry for the others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all very near friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues that give him freedom have also been opened to each of experimenting. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The some ones to the other ones with the music of each commend and it could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> The relation of you with the fame word has not been simple; however, thanks to its success, they have been able to make what they want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do they find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> To as we have kept growing, it has been easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We make sure of that not to be of tour too much because it is easy to fall in that game of the big crowds and of the people that loves your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as one remembers that the people are there for the music, that remembers you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without taking a fancy because it was famous and being a star rock, something that to any of us is really not interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How does it remember its other project Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we write very good songs and it was at first a little enormous. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band for almost three years and never publish a disk even that after Andy (Andrew Woods) died. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There were many frustrations because it lasted so much and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think in the incredible person that Andy was and how it did me to laugh, was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk of music and futbol and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was a surprising human being and we miss it. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national band Las Robertas will be the person in charge to open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know its work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that because of that they chose it for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked more, so we are anxious to see live what Las Robertas can offer and to have to be very amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why do they always change the live letter of Yellow Ledbetter? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it and I think that he makes it with how first it occurs to him. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bass guitar player, which are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> They are so many. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> In the first that happen me Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, are C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> They are so many that he could speak all the afternoon on the bass guitar players that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite not being a fashion any longer? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think that we all always feel disconnected from the grunge word a little. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, remembers me the bands that I mentioned before Nirvana, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and all the that they rose at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I believe that it is a little marvelous because it is music that listening is worth and bands as Mudhoney are doing now better musical than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first, its music had some darker contents and has now turned more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> To what is this change due? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting because I think that there is a couple of songs in the new album that perhaps seem lighter, but there are also songs, as The End or Just Breathe that they qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both of them, when Ed touched them for me, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply dark songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when you grow and there is some trauma in your life and a relative or a friend is lost, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, undoubtedly represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I think that it can be been a happy person and still like this to be able to do music that is dark. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> Peru: </seg>

<seg id="2133"> Super Mario has fought, tireless, throughout 25 years for saving the princess Peach of the claws of the wicked Bowser, but never until now it had made it in three dimensions: in &quot; Super Mario 3D Land&quot; will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> The bond, which arrives this month to the stores of all the world, has been designed from a beginning to make use of the characteristics of the portable console Nintendo 3 DS, which allows playing in three dimensions without having to use glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> &quot;Mario is the character that the estereoscopía without glasses has to say how it must work&quot;, affirmed the responsible one of technical press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Álvarez indicated that &quot; Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first video game of Nintendo thought originally for that support&quot;, since until now successes as &quot;Star Fox 64 3 D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of swindles 3D were adaptations of existing bonds. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The spokesman of Nintendo has held that, despite being in 3D, &quot; Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;accessible&quot; video game that allows enjoying a fast and fluid departure. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Álvarez has stated that &quot; Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to catch the less skilful users. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> Once surpassed, the most expert will be able to give a &quot;second turn&quot; to the levels of game, which this time present bigger difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Besides, the users will be able to choose real-time between an &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to surpass the different challenges and &quot;not to succumb to optical illusions&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> This incursion of super Mario in the three dimensions means also the turn of the character to a portable console, done that it did not take place since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> In this video game Nintendo he does winks to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consistent in the plumber of the moustache having to go over platforms mined of dangers with the aim of releasing the princess Peach. </seg>

<seg id="2154"> The entity appeared to prevent the fall in the marginalization of boys without formation </seg>
<seg id="2155"> The balance of the first 25 years of life of the entity of social support Trinijove is important: 6,000 youngsters in risk of exclusion have received help to surpass a difficult situation along this quarter of a century. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> The long hundred of jobs obtained at present for this social group is added to that. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> The anniversary was used yesterday for doing balance in an act i Coats that more than 300 people attended celebrated in the old factory complex of Fabra. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> Trinijove appeared in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping youngsters with little formation, without work, with problems of dogradicción or in situation of falling in the marginalization. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a great number of ones responsible for entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The varied political representation, whole electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> Beside the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and to its predecessor Jordi Pujol, they assisted the exconseller of socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the exlieutenant of mayor and current ecosocialista town councilor Ricard Gomà to the act. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Coats also went to the big room of the Fabra i the current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the chief operating officer of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> But stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult period and that the current one is also it, but added that the work carried out until now &quot;is a good base&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The president put Trinijove as example because he knew how to fight against the bad circumstances and because it gave the people expectation with difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> &quot;The crisis is not a little new for the entity and for the work that carries out&quot;, appeared. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> An okupada estate dislodged where macroholidays were done </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 flats of the building, in Balmes, 51 </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The 12 occupants left the estate the midday of yesterday without offering endurance </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51 of the street of Balmes lived has arrived to its end. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people left the midday of yesterday the property that they occupied illegally, and where they organized macroholidays that despaired the neighborhood, for court order and without the need for a police intervention, voluntarily. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> When it finished the operation, the latch of the door was changed to prevent the situation being repeated. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From now there will be a control of access&quot;, stated the administrator. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 flats of the building -the rest are lived-, took all the electrical installation and part of that of the water from alcoholic drinks, besides painting the walls and leaving wastes of every type, especially broad. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> The three first flats were the scenario of the massive holidays, which lasted days up to two and despaired the tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, that has also been seen damaged. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained To Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has brought 80% down. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the discotheque notes that the invaders of the estate did it unfair competition, since they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they cost 10. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Besides, the owner of the site of leisure had had to answer to local complaints for noise, while, as it noted, the customers of the discotheque, but the inhabitants of the okupada home and, especially, the assistants to the holidays that were organized there provoke the bothers, that they had increased its frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The one responsible for the discotheque explained that the bothers were so big that even it arrived to an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that &quot;he forgives her&quot; the rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The Municipal Police also confirmed that during the last weeks it had received more complaints of neighbors for the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week &quot;to dislodge the property in an immediate way to finish with the problems of communal life and public spirit that they cause to the neighbors, as well as to the degradation of the area&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The popular leader explained that before the summer alone there was a plant of the building occupied, but throughout the last months the squatters had kept entering in all the plants of the building and almost in all the flats, and that in one thefts have even taken place. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense it added that, &quot;it &quot;is necessary to finish with the impunity and to be strong against the lack of public spirit that has been generated in the estate&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Also yesterday, the Policemen dislodged a building in Nou Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 15.30 o&apos;clock the police went up to the 35 of the street of Mont-ral, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people entered the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The four of them were stopped in the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide in the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the paper of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Amediados of the eighties, whole apogee of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some lampoons of promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure defined the mountain as the big park of the metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> It is more, was accompanied of a comparison, in ciphers, with the Central Park from New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was situated again, in the imagery of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that they are not orientated in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification of Collserola as nature reserve results in this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference any longer was not Headquarters Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the paper of the bear Yogi. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> In these it was been until, in September, the town council called for a megacompetition composed by 16 competitions for others so many doors of access to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door sends the idea of park, undoubtedly. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that or somebody intends to put doors to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, so much for its aspect merely organizational as for what means of reflection on the city it is the subject of conversation among all the architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost already a recurrent subject to the that to resort when two members of this former caste of chosen are recognized in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this fact makes, precisely, one of the few coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona opine, and university professors, who have presented themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marten Bayona: the competition is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after the coastal front being tackled &quot;it is made necessary&quot; debate on &quot;the front of mountain&quot;, every time that the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> One &quot;may set off from the base that the largest park of Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for its great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex&quot;, declares the architect for the one who the bond of &quot;doors of Collserola&quot; locks up a &quot;lexical catch&quot;: it does not have to be thought about them &quot;as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where it has to be acted&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies the proposal of &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers derived from what is uncertain that it is nowadays to project the public space&quot; after the experience lived in the eighties and that it had in the area of the Fòrum &quot;its edge of the swan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the delimitation of some borders itself about where it can be built. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> To &quot;limit something is to fix already the following crossing&quot;, that is, his I surpass. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;People have to think in new urbanistic instruments, of planning, because the current ones [with reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to authentic disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> More tightened for the question, Mòdol opines that, simplifying, the vallesana aspect of Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not&quot;, for a question merely topographical. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Mòdol remembers that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola who &quot;must not fall in broken bag&quot;, although he is grateful the opportunity that the town council offers to its guild of taking part in this project &quot;since the first moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And still more, understands that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that allows to the architects to enter in the debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; about whether the one that must lead the multidisciplinary equipments (&quot;a whole success&quot;, notes) that have had to be created is this technical profile: &quot;We, the architects, should be alone a tool&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives bond to this part is complex, because in the bases of the competition a global vision of Collserola misses: &quot;16 transversal competitions -it says- have been called in the mountain-sea meaning, but there is not a reading longitudinal, that it sees and it understands the area in its ensemble&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> That provokes, at least in its case, that it has opted to take part in the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In another way, a project for one of the doors can be startling in program and definition with that of the architect of the door nearby. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In its opinion, that yes, the town council should guarantee that the strip immediately superior to the Round of Dalt should foresee, in all its extension, an area of equipments that carried out a soft transition between the city and what was green. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will go out free </seg>

<seg id="2222"> After remaining 72 days imprisoning, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will go out in freedom after the legal representative of the Net Casino granted the pardon to him before the Penal Second Court of District, which follows a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the attack to the Casino Royale, the owner of the Net Casino, Sergio Gil García, did public a series of photographs and videos in which supposedly Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic fee from it so that the regiomontano town council allowed the clandestine operation of the home of bets. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> After the public complaint, the state Attorneyship opened a penal process against the brother of the panista mayor and on 2 of September was stopped and deep-rooted for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After four hours in the face of the Agent of the Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, it was transferred to the Home of Rooting 1, placed in the Former Neighborhood of the capital of the State. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In that place a second order remained during the 49 following days of rooting when being dictated to him after the agent of the Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office discarded the crimes of bribery and organized delinquency. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On the 19th of October it was supposedly transferred to the penitentiary of Cadereyta because it blackmailed the owners of the Net Casino with a million and a half of pesos; however, it only remained some hours in the reclusorio of medium safety since there were death threats in his against. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him to follow the judgment admitted to the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> The 25 of October it was turned it order to apprehension for the secretary of the Penal Second Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that at almost two months of inquiries sufficient proofs were checked to determine the culpability of Jonás, such an as the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the home of bets in exchange for allowing the operation of it. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday, the legal representative of Net Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, José Luis Pecina went in front of the juzgador one to requesting the pardon for the brother of the royal mayor; for what in the next hours it could recover its freedom. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the legal diligence, the agent of the Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office appointed to the Court, Ramiro Arias, it questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the members of the home of bets was the one that granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> With base the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal is granted to the dossier 197/2011 and no claim will henceforth be able to be presented about the process that was followed for him; besides repair of damage nor punishment being required from it. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> After the audience to the legal representative of the home of bets, near the 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Even the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that has been forgiven legally and its dossier will be filed was transferred by the secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> He will also notify it of the order to immediate freedom that the judge emitted. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the life lost the secretary of Governed, Francisco Blake, and seven more people </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results thrown on the accident where lost the life the secretary of Governed, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more people, indicate that the helicopter was struck directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try an emergency landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, he mentioned that before taking down the airship, the pilot confirmed that the conditions of climate were the ones adequate to fly. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the crosses had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> It also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, for what it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Besides, he said that in the researches done in the area of the impact the appearance of parts is not brought in the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;In a search they are brought that there are not parts or components of the nave in another place, the impact was presented structurally. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, counted with requirements adequate for trasportar the passengers. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The ground presents a pending one of seven degrees at the 30 steepness. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the possible results before; however, the research can last several months, even could reach a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> On its part, Gilberto López Meyer, chief operating officer of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that to the moment of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated in cruising speed and that this happened in an ascending soft ground. </seg>

<seg id="2248"> In the press conference, the headline of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, element enumerated six relevant in the research: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> According to the aeronautical normatividad the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Conditions meteorological: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The reports in the AICM placed conditions adequate for the takeoff, as it advances the airship towards the limiting area between the DF and the State of Mexico layers of cloudiness were presented at low height. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is probable that for the conditions of cloudiness the crew there is an area of smaller elevation and bigger visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca looked for. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of impact and the last record of the airship of the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was not leak of control or alteration in the trajectory of flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersion of remains of the airship in a reduced area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The available information up to the moment allow to mean that the impact happened in a trajectory straight and of side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The boss of dispersion of remains of the airship allow to mean that the helicopter was struck in the ground in a position to structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Evidence of fire or explosion has not been detected: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> In the place of the accident evidences keep not being revealed in the remains of the nave of some type of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The last results of the research indicate that it could have had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the fieldworks parts of the airship to an elevation of 9 have been found a thousand 200 feet on the mean sea level, the ground presents one pending that goes from the seven degrees up to 30 steepness. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the scene in which predictably it disarticulated throughout this tour. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts in the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After the detailed search in an area wider than the place cordoned off, around the accident, they have not found disperse parts of the airship, which strengthens the presumption that the impact seemed structural in a position to integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announces protocol to find gene of obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The Social Insurance manages a research to discover the gene of the obesity in children and youngsters; it is supported in specialists of the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of the Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it directs a research to discover the gene of the obesity in children and youngsters, named protocol &apos;Genetics of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence&apos;, that will allow to have associated markers to the overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a communique, the head of the Unit of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Center Century XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary equipment of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This equipment is supported by specialists and pupils of postdegree of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and of the Center of Research and of Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In the research it is invited to take part to the population it is or not derechohabiente, to go at the sport units participants of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the proofs to the smallest are carried out every Saturday from the hours 8:00. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> It stood out that the protocol started in the Sport Unit Cuauhtémoc (State of West Mexico) and that since the 8 of October, the activity is carried out in the Sport Unit Nezahualcóyolt (State of Orient Mexico). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once the goal to bring 500 or 600 smaller ones together is complied with, the study will continue in the Independence Sport Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sport Unit Morelos (in the north of the Federal District). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> It explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of the genetics with regard to the development of the obesity and to identify risk factors in children and Mexican youngsters to prevent the appearance of illnesses chronic degenerative. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> When being celebrated this 14th of November on the World Day of the Diabetes, it needed the goal to be to bring three thousand children and youngsters between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and monitoring of its fathers, for the application of specific questionnaires on feeding together. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> It will also be asked to them on the physical activity and heredofamiliares background of illnesses, in order to prevent risk factors that trigger off sufferings as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> It detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (peso, cutting, circumference of waist), socket of arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (it is looked to identify genes that are associated with the infantile obesity), is applied to them to all the participants. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cross López indicated that this research is due to the worry of the professionals of the health by the alarming weighty increase in the smallest. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;The enquiries of health of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in so alone six years there was an increase, in the case of the children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of the girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight a dramatic rise was also observed&apos;, the specialist of the IMSS stood out. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> It indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is sustained in that the population of the country differs from others for its genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It informed that in average, the Mexican has 65 per cent of inheritance Indian American, 30 per cent European and five per cent African and this condition reflects in the genes that are associated to diabetes and overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> It explained that in a general way, the genetics of the obesity means the inability of burning the excess of energy that we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of grease. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The investigator explained that the direct profit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows detecting whether they present some degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even, the probability that it suffers metabolic alterations and even prediabetes said, the presence of folds of obscure color (acanthosis) in collar and forearm, that indicate. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the fathers, to whom each of the measurements and the changes in the way of life that must carry out to prevent illnesses is explained. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cross López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic sufferings: the sedentarism, it is the lack of daily physical activity, which to remain most of the sitting day in front of the television set and to use means of transport instead of short distances walking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The biggest consumption of drinks sweeten, of carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, et cetera) with high contents in greases and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol, is also due to the high caloric ingesta, that is. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM would prevent holes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, investigator of the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to cause a mixture with better performance, independently of the environmental conditions and of temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the signals that the pavement sends were attended to, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 a thousand holes every season of rains in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, noticed Rafael Herrera Nájera, investigator of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphaltic pavement is the adequate one, the holes could be reduced in quantity or, even, be eliminated completely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In its conference Una technological opinion of the holes, dictated within the framework of the International Year of the Chemistry, introduced that the laboratory to its charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with a bigger mechanical strength, so much to discharges as at low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Blacksmith Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities of the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of holes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> It explained that the asphalt, the most boring part of the oil, is an ensemble of molecules of hydrocarbons, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenos, that joint give it to the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 centigrade degrees its viscosity is very high and at 50 centigrade degrees presents an almost solid state, whereas at very low temperatures, the asphalt is returned fragile, added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The previous means that in the streets the endurance of the asphalt is not uniform, but keeps being modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, noticed the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The investigator of the FQ observed that the streets of the City of Mexico in the main they are the last three covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which involve to the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the most superficial layers he finds the asphaltic folder, formed by small stones coated in asphalt and afterwards compacted. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the piedritas that the folder constitutes, noted, is bathed with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> As the vehicles go and efforts are generated, this allows the forces to be spread very well in the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it were modified asphalt they would still be spread better, the chemical engineer gave an opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, a last layer folder of rolling, which is done of a fine material of stone, that is, a sand that is also coated in asphalt, called is placed. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is about the layer that is going to be with the plains of the vehicles in touch, it must have more mechanical force than the asphaltic folder must and provide friction in the path. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> When being the part of the pavement that is going to receive and to spread the efforts, the folder of rolling requires, likewise, to have the adequate thickness and care must be taken of the material of the one that is made. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the humidity and the temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, said, because it affects the performance of the asphaltic folder considerably. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the ground gets damp, the water spreads in the interior of the folder and it is difficult that it goes out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of holes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a hole, it said, the first in being worn out is the film of tread and only afterwards the asphaltic folder is affected, but the damage does not happen instantaneously, but it is a process that the first signals with adequate programs of maintenance should be attended to. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the formation of holes and, because of that, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicular burden and to guarantee that it is, to prevent holes being formed frequently. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera noticed that there is still a lot that to investigate and to work on the asphalt, for example, the emulsions asphaltic, that in other countries are already even in the market and allow to repair the holes with easiness and with no need of to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What missed it to the candidate of the Valley to be the new lady Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that affected so that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Señorita Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> The Valley receives its bond number 14 of princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again the Valley of the Cauca keeps the desires for the crown of Señorita Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being in the podium of winners, to exhibit the crown of silver and the band that it credit as new princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the obtained result last night in Cartagena, where the lady Atlantic was raised with the crown and the scepter, the department it already adds 14 bonds of Princess and Melina he one to the legion of women vallecaucanas that they have been near the crown but that were proclamations princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patrician Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Center Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Today the big question that many are done is What was lacking? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result represents the defeat of a big favourite that in every presentation proved that it had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Better Rostro Jolie de Vogue, bonds that obtained queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who were taken the crown of Señorita Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor that is considered key in the decision that took the jury of Primera Princesa designating it roots at the question in that it did not convince with its answer &quot;Which is that book that has marked you you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Wagon Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The vallecaucana answered the interrrogante: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in the literature, I believe that is one forms of culturalizarse, definitely I think that the book that marked me of childhood is &quot;The principito&quot;, is a quite deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At present I read &quot;Crime and punishment&quot;, is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and nowadays I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called &quot;The heat of the blood. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> An answer that little liked first for the term &quot;culturalizarse&quot; and second because it did not explain of way specific of which way each of the books that it mentioned have marked it. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But when finishing the ceremony Melina &quot;the universe&quot; declared that it felt calm and happy with the result &quot;is wise passes what has to pass. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the people, please they read a little, &quot;The principito&quot; is a ledger&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the launched hypotheses it is said that to Valle the favoritism burned it. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogotá insinuated that when being the preferred one, the acclaimed one and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote of the public for the best craft dress, and Mother Queen), &quot;that aroused the jealousies of the other candidates, it stressed out the queen and that&apos;s why it did not shine in the scenario&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it was noticed that in its first presentation in swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening party of coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although in both it exhibited safe, it was noticed that it missed it the force and the impulse that yes the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic proved. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;As at home&quot;, of the Channel RCN opined that the fact that Melina was designated princess &quot;checks that the candidate that more desire prizes during the competition does not remain as queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Besides, Valle was shown very evasive to the last one with the press, and he made a mistake there. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle did not manage to convince the jury on its interest towards the social work, which is, the essence of the National Competition of Beauty, in last. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> For something, two days before the choice the promised international Lucy Doughty appeared that they looked for a compromising woman with the social needs for its pais. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;The beauty alone not coarse in a Miss Colombia, has to be looked but there of what is physical and to be focused in its social sensitivity, which before depositing to the Competition are already involved in projects,&quot; explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It is also speculated that Valle sinned for its blemishes in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticed it in its abdomen, but is contradictory then precisely the jury chose it as the candidate &apos;Natural Beauty&apos; with the healthiest body, good feeding and work physical responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The trainer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, which there was better, &quot;but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for my not was very notorious, brought down points to him on the last day&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the operations that was practiced. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The cirugías are well, but Valle did not know them to himself to do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Its body was never its fort and they took the money for it here&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this prize, which for the first time delivers the National Competition of the Beauty, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction rose up that last night was complied with, for it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, what is true is that Melina since today starts a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, position that offers Colombia the possibility to represent in one of the international competitions for designation of the National Competition itself. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, it will happen to the history as one of the queens that in spite of its overwhelming crossing for Cartagena, was it evasive the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Like this it was the work of the from Cali that it identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A lofoscopista of Cali happened to the history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these civil servants is a key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On the 4th of November a lofoscopista of the CTI of Cali happened to the history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum head of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, through the collation of its fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven lofoscopistas that work in the sectional one of the CTI, that week touched it the turn of &quot;availability&quot; to Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tiled that it takes 21 years working in the area of judicial research. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> When initiating its career, González worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where many times it had to penetrate the forest for more than five days to arrive to the place in which the corpses that had to be identified were. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In the 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after carrying out the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the frictional skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and of the feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of the operative one against alias Alfonso Cano warned Eliazar that it wore clothes at the minimum for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big waited for him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> On Friday in the night it went out for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> It knew that it had to identify two corpses and that it was suspected that one of them was of the man that directed to the oldest guerrilla of the world, for what they asked him for it to take the fingerprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (its real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, when it arrived with the equipment of research to the place in which he found the corpse he did not recognize it for its physical aspect, for it was very different to the one that he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> It was, dressed as a peasant of the area, without glasses and much thinner, without beard. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But the marks do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Galtoniana, ink, accompanied of a magnifying glass one trans plantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the finger impressions of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Its eye did not fail it: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the native man of Puerto Tiled was the person in charge to confirm the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that yes it was about the maximum head of the Farc to him. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the mark </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín de Cali the recognition that the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González did, in the press conference for the operative one against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin for error, that can get to be a key in the resolution of crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support researches for crimes as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they are captured, many criminals present false licenses or do not have papers. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take the finger impression for them and look for them in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The investigator said that, in a case of theft, to it taking away a piece of wall of a home, for in that place the thief had supported its hand to take a safe full of jewels and money, went. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to take a finger impression, but in that case we could obtain the mark of all the hand and to identify the criminal, who had taken part in different thefts&quot;, remembered. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The marks can also discard or to reaffirm suspicious in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Not long ago they found a dead man, with bottles of liqueur around you. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> By the research it was determined that a relative could be suspect of the crime and, indeed, a mark in the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that he has been the murderer, yes he places it in the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactiloscopista of the CTI explained that in the objects &quot;the marks are taken with chemical reagents or physicists&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, it is used one trans plantador or ribbon to lift them. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, that it is the delincuencial database, or to the Registraduría. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians with no identity papers&quot;, indicated the expert of the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> It clarified that not everything is as it is shown in the program of television CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Like this not as all what shines it is gold, not by all what is touched mark is returned. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, if it can be used, if the respective collation is carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; ones challenge authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in front of the post Zuccotti to camp. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A big part attended to the order to eviction and moved to a near paruqe. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Ocupa Wall Street challenged this Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again the post of Manhattan of where they were dislodged of dawn, under the protection of a court order, and when trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in front of the post Zuccotti, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that it allows the &quot;indignant&quot; ones to camp in the place, whereas another part of the movement answered to the eviction occupying a park more in the north of the city, where there have been new arrests again. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp in the post again, we are going to install ourselves in some other place and we will continue the pacific legal battle for returning to Zuccotti, as well as through sittings and demonstrations&quot;, it said one of the spokesmen of the movement &quot;Occupies Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray detailed that the answer of the &quot;indignant&quot; ones to the eviction of its camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived up to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings emitted an order that forbade the obligatory evacuation from the place and it allowed the demonstrators to remain camped. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Besides, the &quot;indignant&quot; ones proceeded to the occupation of a new park Canal situated in the confluence of the centric ones Street and the Sixth Avenue, very near the entry to the tunnel Holland, which joins New York and New Jersey, and estate of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least during an hour they managed to occupy the place, but the Police went afterwards and she proceeded to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific cipher, while she assured Efe that she saw several journalists who were also handcuffed. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization assures that those that had been installed in that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and that has tried to mediate with the Police, are several hundreds of people. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, the post Zuccotti -which is an enclosure of private property- is still closed waiting for the celebration of a judicial sight foreseen for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation from this dawn must be analyzed. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some of the demonstrators displaced up to there carried and distributed at these hours copies of that court order and even delivered them to the agents that guarded the post, which provoked &quot;some small confrontations&quot;, indicated Bray, who reported the demonstrators that some officers gave knocks. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The prohibe court order to the authorities to dislodge the members of Ocupa Wall Street or to apply &quot;laws that were published after it started the occupation or to forbid to the demonstrators to access again to the park with stores or other estates that used previously&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The mayor Bloomberg indicated before the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, who it warned, however, which the local laws do not allow them themselves to install with tents again and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The alderman defended personally the eviction carried out of dawn of the post Zuccotti, an operation in which people proceeded to about 200 arrests and that was decided because the demonstrators were &quot;violating the law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that it gave the order to evacuate the post because this was being converted &quot;in a place in the that the people not venÍan&quot; to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do damage to other people&quot;, &quot;already&quot; that &quot;some habÍan businesses received threats&quot; and the neighbors feared &quot;for its quality of life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The eviction of this dawn was sickening and proves that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that those of the American workers&quot;, added the spokesman of the movement, who accused to the mayor of &quot;missing the respect to the freedom of speech&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The responsible ones of &quot;Occupies Wall Street&quot; also indicated that they think to organize &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that last the protests, that started the 17 of September. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Sun Hat Anderson will be the Virgin María in one special navideño of television </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Beside Michael Bublé and other distinguished Canadians, the next 1 of December will appear in the program of television &quot;It&apos;s to Russell Peters Christmas&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, conejita of &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of the musician of rock Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin María in one special of Christmas of the Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The commercial channel of television CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the &quot;crooner&quot; (baladista) Michael Bublé and other distinguished Canadians, the next 1 of December will appear in the program of television &quot;It&apos;s to Russell Peters Christmas&quot; giving life to one very particular Virgin María. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV distributed today images of the program of television in the that Anderson, also known by the wide distribution in internet of a pornographic home video in which it appears together with his then husband, the drummer of &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot;, Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin María sustaining in a manger a doll that represents Jesus. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a Canadian comical acquaintance of Indian origin that recently &quot;My Violent Torpedo of&quot; acted as the tour as presenter partially &quot;Truth&quot; of Charlie Sheen, appears as José. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Besides Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas one of CTV says with the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires to the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato, and which is not strange to the controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &quot;fox&quot; to the American Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan revives after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The PIB grows 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that it initiated in March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> From the last month of March the Japanese economics was found paralyzed, still convalescent for the devastating earthquake that happened in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered from the II World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo reckoned the material leaks at 300,000 million dollars, a knock, that, in spite of the difficult world context, it seems to have been toned down. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September was used for passing page, definitely: 1.5% was increased by the PIB in comparison with the previous quarter and 6% in anualizada rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The one registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - it means, besides, the biggest rate of growth since the period of January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is explained, partially, by the rise of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the posterior tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, the companies increased its inversions in 1.1%, in the face of the descent from the 0.9% in capital expenditures that was observed of January to March, the first turning back after six months of uninterrupted rises. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the revulsive true one of the Japanese economics is not based exclusively in the Keynesian impulse that invites to make use of the crises to reinforce - or to reconstruct - the infrastructures, to make use of the lacks to grow from zero. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan has woken up, especially, thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, which at present represents 60% of the Japanese PIB. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable climbed 1%, pushed by the increase of the expense in vehicles, journeys and activities of leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has been told to the home market, when the yen - the Japanese coin - has been converted in one of the &quot;shelter values&quot; chosen by the investors who avoid the crisis of debt in the euro area and the turbid forecasts of US., a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a harder exchange, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious backhand for a country whose economic water line comes determined by the health of the great technologic sets. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> For example, Toyota or Sony attributed its weak results between July and September to the price of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue with its siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not bring the guard down. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;Has that to be attentive to the risks that persist, as the deterioration of some foreign economics, the impact of the floodings of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen&quot;, indicated the State secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And, in effect, the perspectives are not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for the Cooperation and the Economic Development (OCDE) needed most of the member countries to present in September clear plus signa of economic slow-motion. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the world economics highlighted that the main powers are being stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Since it brought four tenths down up to the 100.4 points, in front of the 100.8 of August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The euro area, even, situated below the average, which is in the level 100, as eight tenths were precipitated up to the 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens nurtures the doubts again </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written appointment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the shot peripheral premiums for risk and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parquets, Greece keeps tangling in the labyrinth that it drives towards the exit of the great crisis of European debt. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The sensation that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek transitional Government comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels than for a genuine conviction of the political forces starts to be confirmed with facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new first minister, Lukas Papadimos, noticed yesterday that there is not alternative for the structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days granted in its designation perhaps is remained short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it will not back new measures of austerity up in any case and reiterated its demand of new choices for the date foreseen, on 19 of February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summit of the 26 of October&quot;, affirmed Papadimos when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate morning with a vote of confidence to the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A packet with 24 programs to give impulse to the employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of the civil servants and new measures against the tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras does not clear the doubts on its posture: &quot;We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, stung still for the impact provoked by the órdago of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the help if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek matches do not sign &quot;an appointment written without ambiguity and as soon as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman of Economic Matters, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will go back &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss what is needed to pay the sixth section&quot; of 8,000 million with the new Government, although there is not definite date either. </seg>

<seg id="2439"> Ms Sofia: &quot;They are instruments for the progress and the expectation&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen highlights the &quot;preponderant&quot; place of Spain in relation to this financial type </seg>
<seg id="2441"> Spain &quot;has reached a preponderant place to world level in the paper of the Microfinances&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> The Queen Ms Sofia remembered yesterday that the country has been converted in these two last decades in the second donor of the suggests in relation to this intrumento of cooperation, whose &quot;essence&quot; indicated that it lies in being an &quot;instrument for the social progress, the justice and the expectation of a better future for all the humanity, based on the confidence in the human being.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of the Microloan in Valladolid with the conviction that &quot;there is not doubt&quot; that type of operations is are &quot;absolutely essential to reach the Goals of the Millennium established for United Nations with horizon 2015, and, very especially, in the one that has as goal the reduction to half of the volume of people&quot; that they live with inferior admissions to one to dolar journal, with in which the &quot;threshold of poverty&quot; is fixed. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;keeps working&quot; to extend the net of beneficiaries &quot;to all the corners of the planet, and assumes this task with &quot;responsibility&quot;,&quot; indicated Ms Sofia, which expected the initiatives and contributions that are originated in the Summit, which will be prolonged until Thursday, to &quot;guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for the women&quot;, main &quot;beneficiaries for these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> They are &quot;many the reached achievements&quot; and &quot;many the challenges that we face&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Summit of the Microloan is posed not only as a forum of debate, but also as the platform from which to give impulse &quot;to two basic goals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, Su Majestad explained that it is inhaled to which at the end of 2015 they are 175 the millions of poor families that have accessed to these financial services and that hundred million those homes come out of the threshold of poverty in which they are sunk. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The impulse in the conception of the microloans in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path initiated years of a pioneer form ago&quot; for Muhammad Yunus, speed control hump Ms Sofia as an &quot;act of justice and owed recognition&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And is that it described to the father of this tool as one &quot;idealistic admirable in the universal cause of the fight against the poverty&quot;, whose work knows since 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know its policy of loans on the ground, ago. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> To this experience they followed it a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings as the ones celebrated in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;in all have been able to confirm the continuous evolution&quot;,&quot; explained Su Majestad, whose link with this project cost yesterday the qualifier of the &quot;head of family&quot; gathered together in Valladolid on the part of the &quot;baquero of the poor ones&quot; for her. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Ms Sofia concluded its intervention cheering up to the present ones to take part in the debate and in the search of solutions to advance in the fight against the poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinity Jiménez, noticed that the solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for every democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, it exposed that it would be an error to link the cooperation with paises in the process of development to periods of economic calm condition, since it is a &quot;permanent duty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that the microloans mean &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicate the poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more that the governments of developed countries must never work under criteria of solidarity and leave that this is a casualty of the cutbacks. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, the microloan consists of &quot;one of the main lines of cooperation to the development&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> On its part, the State Secretary of International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; of giving &quot;confidence&quot; the people &quot;excluded to those who all close the doors&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present ones to a city that &quot;opens its doors contaminated of the supportive spirit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU suggests choosing the European President for universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian-democratic Union (CDU), on Monday the 14th of November, in Leipzig, it has gone by without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-democratic match. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> At first it had not been included in the agenda the future of Europe, but the subject was imposed in fall, particularly to satisfy to the militants that consider that the policy of the Government is at present too little strict with the Greeks and rotted to be it in a future with the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, suggested by the address, was adopted practically unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Of the 1,001 delegates, so alone were registered nine votes against and ten abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes that they got round, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the financial Minister eurófilo, clear any possible doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, are summarized in a motto: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not alone because Europe means the peace, but also because &quot;nine million employments depend directly on the euro&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the hour of making the way has arrived in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could appear in modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon to allow reinforcing the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the area of the euro, although it could also flow into the choice of the President of the European Commission for universal suffrage &quot;to give Europe a face&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea about Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Undoubtedly, it is little probable that the twenty-seven of them arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is shown hostile in front of it and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the ball is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> On the other hand, the delegates have rejected for an overwhelming majority the proposal of pondering the peso of every country of the directive of the European Central Bank according to the peso of every economics, which evidently would reinforce the peso of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Anxious to soothe the spirits in the interior of its match, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that it has tried to earn its congress at the expense of the &quot;small&quot; European countries or of the countries in difficulties ready to criticize the arrogant Germany either. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of &quot;the frank-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel has not mentioned France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except of passing. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleón. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The incidence of the fraud in the sick leave </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government they start an offensive against the sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 of November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for the family allowances and to pronounce a speech about the subject, already recurrent from 2007, of the fight against the social fraud and the ayudantía. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Besides, to accompany such an offensive, which sets off of the will of saving rigorously, but still like this remembers to an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> In the first place, to apply budgetary cutbacks: the Government foresees to impose on the workers of the private sector a the fourth day of lack before being able to catch the decrease. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> All in all, except that there is a specific corporate agreement, a worker that falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of its monthly admissions. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> It is a measure that could lift a wave of wrath, but that would allow saving 280 million euros, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Besides, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing a day of lack without remuneration in the event of work decrease (up to the moment, they do not have lack, in front of the three days that they apply themselves to the private sector) on the civil servants. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these questions are discussed, the majority puts again on the table equally the subject of the fraud, this time orientated to the abuses of the work casualties. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The controls are going to be increased considerably and, besides, if somebody is discovered committing a fraud, it will have to pay the amounts back&quot;, noticed Xavier Bertrand talking in the RTL on Sunday 13 of November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in the other cases, the effects of the advertisement seem slightly out of proportion for the reality of the fraud on the subject of work casualties. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> In fact, since 2002 a constant follow-up of this question is carried out and different political offensives that, normally have borne, have been launched. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The Frenchmen do not fall more ill than in the rest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Let&apos;s observe the national ciphers with attention, in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the French Institute of the social security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in services for work casualties. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute of research and documentation in economics of the health, the subsidies for the casualties represented, in 2008, 5% of the sanitary expense, promoting 11,300 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this addition, 46% corresponds to the casualties for maternity and for industrial accidents, whereas 54% is related with the sick leave, cipher that rises at 6,200 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Therefore, 2.5% of the expense in health. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the Frenchmen have caught an average of 14.5 days of work decrease, in front of 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Soul group Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average that, undoubtedly, hides deviations: another enquiry, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed French employees stated that they had not caught even a single day of sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leave had a duration inferior to 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were more prolonged. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> If we compare them with our European neighbors, the French workers are not more prone than in other areas to catch sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study carried out in 2010 by two investigators of the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence of the work (for reasons of health as well as of another type) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, in front of 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud in the sick leave is not specially significant in comparison with the not declared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The fraud has a quite limited scope. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has provoked that the controls of the sick leave of more than 45 days are systematic. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM checked, by 13% of the 285,000 ones carried out, which the casualties of short duration were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, that is, 37,050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, submitted to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases was &quot;appropriately adapted or unjustified; a cipher that, having a total of 1.2 million as departure, rises to 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Therefore, a total of 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases among several millions of workers who caught a sick leave is reached. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Undoubtedly, an insignificant cipher in comparison, for example, with the work in black. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the representative of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this question in June, this practice would represent some leaks of fiscal admissions of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of the subsidies for casualties and, undoubtedly, considerably more that the fraud in this last area. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to straighten its economics. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what declared on Monday 14 of November, the First Minister Lucas Papadémos in front of to the Parliament; he added likewise that the hundred days that they have been granted to its Government of union they would not be enough to reach such a goal. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To carry out efforts that take to the recovery of the economics, we need the support of our European members and a new program of budgetary adjustment&quot;, declared the Head of the Government, who pronounced its first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The execution of the decisions adopted during the Summit of the area of the euro on 27 of October will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, since the permanence of the country &quot;is in game&quot; in the area of the euro, added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Consequently, Papadémos has foreseen that the public deficit of the country will be reduced &quot;up to around 9%&quot; of the PIB before end of year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right refuses new measures of austerity </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday its support to the measures already approved to try to go out from the crisis of the debt, but it has noticed that its match will not commit itself with additional measures of austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures&quot;, stated during a meeting with the representatives of its match &quot;New Democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> It indicated that it agreed with the goals of reduction of the deficit and of the debt, like this as of fight against the waste, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner of Economic and Monetary Matters, that it warned that the FMI and the EU would not unblock the loan of 8,000 million euros necessary without an accountability written to the planned measures of the support of all the matches, Antonio Samaras has answered that its word would be sufficient and that it would not sign at all because of the confining pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> A committee of experts states that the euthanasia and the assisted suicide must be legalized </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live denying the death, as it indicates the report of the Real Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> On the subject of mitigating cares, the committee claims that the governments, the institutions of sanitary assistance and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the best mitigating cares, and not alone in the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society lives denying the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> In fact, so alone 9% of the Canadians is ready to talk with its doctor on the conditions in which they want to die and take arrangements to such an effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> They are one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Real Society of Canada, which he counted with the participation of six experts of different areas, included the ethical one, the legal one and the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends to the Government that modifies the Criminal Code so that the assisted suicide is allowed and the euthanasia, when this option is suggested by the patient and has been judged competent to take the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> To start, the experts mention a recent enquiry of the Economist Intelligence Unit who compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada occupies the put lottery ticket, the study indicates that &quot;the medicalization of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the people have fear to treat the subject of the death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> With medication or not, 77% of the Canadians does not have access to mitigating cares, as they indicate the experts selected by the Real Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And, even though most of the Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them ends up dying in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> As a whole, Québec registers the highest rate in this sense, where 86% of the deaths takes place in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> As for the delicate subject of the euthanasia and of the assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrived to some conclusions that do not coincide with the posture of the Federal Government, which has already declared that he does not want to modify the Criminal Code in relation to the euthanasia and the assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all the countries where these practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is not any proof that, that is the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not provoked an abuse of its application, the use of the euthanasia or of the suicide assisted with people not competent or who had not given its consent. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Jocelyn Downie, coauthor of the report, stated yesterday for teleconferencing that, on the contrary, more excesses in those countries were observed where the euthanasia nor the assisted suicide have been legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;In Canada the euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;In Canada the assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal&quot;, explains Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians, favorable to the euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let&apos;s remember that 85% of the Canadians has already been pronounced in favor of the euthanasia, since they opine that it would allow the people whose death is next to relieve its suffering, as it indicates an enquiry of Angus Reid carried out in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Besides, 66% thinks that the fact that he legalizes the euthanasia will not give that the life of the elderly or disabled people has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people who have practiced the assisted suicide, 41% of the interviewed ones opines that a process should not begin against them. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In relation to the maintenance or interruption of the sanitary assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as they indicate the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Besides, among its recommendations they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of the sanitary cares, if they have been refused legally, does not mean a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The committee of experts asks likewise that the sanitary professionals in having to respect the fact that a patient rejects the assistance at the end of its life without fear to face a complaint be formed. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> On the subject of mitigating cares, the committee claims that the governments, the institutions of sanitary assistance and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the best mitigating cares, and not alone in the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in relation to the mitigating or terminal sedation, which is already used in a large way in the sanitary institutions of Canada, the committee asks that, except that it is used for reducing the physical pain, it is considered as euthanasia and submits to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Other experts express reservations </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Other experts of the area of the Law of health already have expressed its reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, specialistic in Law of the health, has qualified as &quot;extreme&quot; the posture of the experts that sign the report, among other things because the practice of the euthanasia to the ill ones is not limited in terminal phase. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This leaves the door opened to a situation in which somebody who is tired to live and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide, indicates Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr. Deschamps stands out likewise that the authors of the report seem to prioritize the personal autonomy on any other value of the society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> However, he adds that &quot;in society, there are labels and limitations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The specialist in Law of the health Margaret Somerville also expressed its &quot;strong opposition&quot; with regard to the conclusions of the report, which it qualified as &quot;plus manifesto of the euthanasia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, puts in cloth of judgment especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where the euthanasia and the assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregón. </seg>

<seg id="2588"> Monti has committed itself to, when it occupies the charge, he working taking the urgency into account and with the aim of Italy &quot;recovering its protagonism&quot; in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> A spokesman of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn has stood out that &quot;even with a new Government, it will not vary our diagnosis of the Italian economics&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal to obtain a budgetary balance in 2013 in spite of the plans of austerity adopted during the last months, has asked for the adoption of new measures of rigor. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The &quot;head of the&quot; Italian &quot;heads&quot; Emma Marcegaglia, that it will see it the mat, insisted likewise on the need to give impulse to the economics, &quot;since a country that does not grow can not respect the requirements on the subject of deficit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Monti, famous for its competence and its independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), means a &quot;change of period&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;berlusconismo&quot;; the &quot;professor&quot; symbolizes the challenge of the seriousness&quot; and &quot;another Italy&quot;, as they state the leader writers. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> The great unknown factor will be the longevity of its equipment. </seg>

<seg id="2595"> A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program </seg>
<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, as he stated on Monday a specialized American ONG in the atomic risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> For the identification of the investigator, the Institute of Science and International Safety (ISIS) bases itself on a recent report of the International Agency of the Atomic Energy (AIEA) and on other documents emitted by this agency of the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The AIEA expressed the week its &quot;severe worry&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear program passed. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to the ISIS, basing itself in a large way on documents of the AIEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, Soviet soldier would have worked for three decades, since the years 1960, in a nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and he would have taken part in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company centered in the production of &quot;nanodiamonds&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic problems of its company would have led him to contact themselves with the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> Afterwards, he thinks that he cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before going back to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its last report, the AIEA mentions that there are &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a system of nuclear detonation &quot;with the help of a foreign expert, that not alone knew well the technique, but, as it has also informed a Member State to the Agency, it worked during most of its career in this technology in the military nuclear program of its country of origin&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased 50% </seg>
<seg id="2605"> The crimes and crimes against the Muslims have increased nearly one 50% between 2009 and 2010, whereas, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased alone slightly, as they indicate the statistics published by the FBI on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to these ciphers, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has passed 107 by 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, has increased in 49%, in front of a rise of 13% in the case of the acts of violence against the Catholics, a reduction of 4% in the crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in the number of crimes and antireligious crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> The total number of &quot;crimes of hatred&quot; has grown slightly up to the 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% owes to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as it indicates the FBI. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> &quot;After a decline in 2009, worrisome result that this type of crimes and crimes have increased again,&quot; stood out the organization of defense of the human rights Human Rights First, &quot;the increase of the acts of violence against Muslims is specially significant&quot;, added the organization in a communique. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> &quot;Human Rights First takes a lot of time indicating that the violence against the Muslims, as well as all the types of crimes of hatred, should be considered a severe rape of the human rights&quot;, adds one responsible for the organization, Paul Legendre. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> Introduction of a budgetary &quot;rule of gold&quot; in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The Government of big Social democrat/democratacristiano coalition that is ruling in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a budgetary &quot;rule of gold&quot; in the Constitution to reduce the public deficit and, like this, to prevent a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria on the part of the agencies of credit qualification (triple A). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> He was the social democrat Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian national debt reaches 74.6%, a cipher very superior to the maximum limit of the 60% fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the solvency of Austria were reduced in a single level, of AAA to AA+, more in interests should pay 3,000 million euros &quot;every year&quot;, indicated the democratacristiano Vice-Chancellor of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria answers like this to a request of the Summit of Brussels to the member countries of the area of the euro of the 26th of October: in it, the Heads of State and of Government they asked for the inclusion, before ends of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and of the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The device taken on by the Austrian Government approaches the &quot;German model&quot;, since Germany was the first European country that adopted that type of &quot;rule&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease every year by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (PIB) and, from the 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not surpass every year 0.35% of the PIB, whereas the regional States, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The goal consists in which, towards 2020/2021, the national debt comes down under the criterion of the 60% fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> A strong yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threatens a new intervention of the market of change </seg>
<seg id="2633"> The First Japanese Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, noticed the marked one of the change Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would take part again if the yen kept increasing. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will take part, as we did it last time, if we prove that an excessive volatility&quot; is produced&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, it explained Noda To the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen rose until it reached some levels close to the historical maximums that caused the intervention of the Japanese authorities on the 31st of October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo sold massively yen per dollars to bring down the value of the Japanese exchange, which had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the American coin. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen has gone, given impulse by the purchases of investors that consider it a &quot;shelter value&quot; in these uncertain times of economic world slow-motion and of crisis of debt in Europe, soaring gradually since then. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar to valued on Tuesday again to less than 77 yen and the euro has gone down below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching some next levels at which they provoked the last intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at about 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> This explosion of the Japanese exchange damages the exports of the archipelago, since it brings up the price of the products Made un Japan and reduces the value of the admissions obtained abroad by the Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan is fighting for being reconstructed after the earthquake&quot; and the tsunami of the 11 of March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), highlighted Noda, who fears the price increase of the yen cutting the weak recovery by its roots. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> The third economic world power has recovered the growth in the third quarter (1.5% in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase of the exports and of the consumption of the homes affected by the catastrophe. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the First Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the &quot;economic bases of Japan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The financial Minister, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which inaugurated on Tuesday a meeting of two days of its Board of currency policy, which takes on all the possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> However, the attached Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken &quot;the adequate measures&quot;, a bigger monetary flexibility giving that it should not be waited for on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> During its last meeting at the end of October, the institute of broadcast increased its purchases of Treasury Bills in five trillion yen (47,000 million euros), taking the threshold of the backgrounds that he dedicates to the acquisition of different financial bonds to flood the market of liquidity at the 55 trillion yen (519,000 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Area of the euro: </seg>
<seg id="2648"> the types grow, the bags weaken </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The risk of infection of the crisis of the debt keeps damaging the European indexes. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> In spite of the nomination of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as of some better ciphers of growth in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries keep increasing. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> Still worried about the stability of the stability of the area of the euro, the European bags sink a little more in the negative area on Tuesday the 15th of November. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris, at 10 o&apos;clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and situates itself to 3,064 points. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The Dax loses in Frankfurt 0.4% and in London 0.1%. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Taking the new tensions into account in relation to the yields of the loans of the most affected States of the area of the euro, the stock markets of all the world keep yielding part of its recent profits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;The investors, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the risk of infection&quot;, explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor in IG Markets, mentioned by the agency Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Bag of Tokyo has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the worries of the inspectors of the market in relation to the capacity of Europe of containing the crisis of the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, as the rest of the world, has the stare in Europe and the exchanges will keep being carried out in a margin of variances reduced, so that the investors will not have proofs that the situation&quot; has been &quot;stabilized&quot;, it considers Mitsushige Akino, manager of backgrounds in Ichiyoshi Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The reappearance of the worries about the future of the area of the euro affects the single currency, which it keeps bringing down on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro continues in its lowest level since a month ago and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> Towards the 10 hours, the European exchange cost 1.3570 dollars, a fall of 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to the corridors, it has lost value after the match of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which Monday in the Congress was brought together, adopted a motion that foresees, particularly, the option that a country in difficulties went out of the area of the euro without leaving the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The Italian and Spanish types surpass 6% amply </seg>
<seg id="2663"> The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at some very worrisome levels. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> On Tuesday in the morning, the yield of the Italian duties at 10 years reached 6.85%, whereas the Spanish bonds to the same deadline offered 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions in relation to the types of interest of the countries of the south, although also of France, they keep nurturing the fears of the inspectors. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which moves the risk to asphyxiate with the peso of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new First Greek Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part has stated that the application of the decisions adopted in the Summit of the area of the euro on the 27th of October would be the &quot;main work&quot; of its Government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is in the point of sight of the markets, whereas on Sunday the parliamentary elections will be celebrated there. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The difference of the types (&quot;spread&quot;) among the duties at 10 years in Germany and Spain, has reached a new historical maximum. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> Waiting for the ciphers of growth of the area of the euro </seg>
<seg id="2671"> From the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a cipher more favorable than the 0.3% planned, given impulse by the domestic consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The Insee, however, has revised a la baja the cipher of the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Besides, the fourth quarter it is the one that really worries the economists. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany, on its part, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The first forecasts for the ensemble of the area of the euro at 11 o&apos;clock are foreseen, after the European Commission has warned on the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energetic policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts must cost more than the dogmas must </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is a subject that can not be treated taking short-term considerations into account or simply thinking in the emotions, it is the energetic policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and the cost of the electricity are influential directly in the purchasing power and in the competitiveness of the companies. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is adequate that an electoral meeting is the moment of reflecting on such questions and on the place of the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only be useful if it studies the ensemble of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the suggested options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The Frenchmen must base its opinion in objective facts, on rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Now that we are 7,000 million people in the planet, the demographical evolution will mean the duplication of the electrical demand before 2050, unless an enormous part of the world population is deprived of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, the shortage will have to be mitigated every bigger time of the fossil resources to keep causing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperious need to reduce the broadcasts of greenhouse gases to fight against the climatic change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> That&apos;s why, Germany remains alone in its decision of renouncing the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> That is not the case not even of Belgium, which submits his to the need to find a fountain capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which only it has for goal to build headquarters of last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, because they mention some examples, continue ahead with determination with its projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, for its side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, taking up the construction of an interrupted headquarters after the accident of Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, based on the renewable energies, is presented on occasions as example, the reality goes against such a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin is going to mean a price increase of the price of the electricity, a bigger energetic dependence for the need increased of gas imported, particularly of Russia, an increase of the broadcasts of CO2 by the construction of headquarters of gas and of coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In some months, the harmful effects will be noticed. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> It must be meditated on on the case of Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Champion of Europe in the eolian sector, which it obtains 30% of its electricity from, is also one of the big users of coal and of gas due to the intermittence of the wind; for this reason, its broadcasts of CO2 and the price of its electricity they are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the evidence of our energetic policy, our neighbors pay a bill of electricity 40% superior to that of the French homes. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Whereas in a globalized economics the cost of the energy constitutes a key factor of the competitiveness and an accountability of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For that reason, any significant reduction of the nuclear energy would mean a strong rise of the price of the electricity, which would take realism away from the marvelous declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> It is a price which the big majority of the Frenchmen refuse to paying and, in fact, they do not express opposition for beginning to that type of energy, as they show the enquiries. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> We remember that the energetic policy of our country has lost to build an industry sector with 125,000 jobs directive and 410,000 indirect employments. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Widely orientated to the export, covers a galaxy of specialized pymes in the markets international and that can create not dislocatable employments. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France decided to give up the nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of many of those PYME and the leak of the 6,000 million annual euros in French exports of equipment and nuclear services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Which electrician would order a designed EPR to work sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the equation of the nuclear energy, it has to be admitted that there is not a miraculous fountain of production of electricity, the same as there is a diabolical fountain either. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development on the part of Areva of solutions with low broadcasts of CO2, nuclear and renewable, proves the character complementary of the sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of the nuclear energy, it is essential to hold the maximum level of safety. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have an Authority of safety that exerts a strict and transparent control on the existing headquarters as well as on the construction of Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our equipments, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed for the safety. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three severe accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> So alone one, that of Three Mile Island, took place in some normal operative conditions; it did not provoke consequences either for the people or for the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to some inexcusable human errors. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of a scope without precedents, which provoked the death of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear sector will learn of this accident, as it made it of the two previous ones. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Thanks to these breakthroughs and to a cooperation between the authorities of safety, and the operators and French and German builders, the EPR presents a design capable of withstanding to such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While study it all the electrical actors that want to build a headquarters, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a big gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them way free to assume the leadership in the unavoidable development of the nuclear sector. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energetic options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave that the emotion, the dogmas and the maneuvers partisans dominated a debate that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economics? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The policy of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized setting off from different points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services submitted to the policy of ciphers, the compatibility of this policy with the statue proclaimed of &quot;country of the human rights&quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment of the foreign students the one that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération of the 23 of May) proclaiming of past that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, workers nor waiters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> However, it is rarely analyzed from the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The question is that, on this subject, there is quite a lot of consensus between the left and the right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the direction declaring in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has with nearly two a million immigrant&quot; workers, whereas in the left, Michel Rocard fixed the pitch explaining that France &quot;can not see about all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, the left as well as the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory for a crowd of Polish plumbers. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> On both sides, it is considered that the immigrants are a French burden for the economics and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with regard to the immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its program, François Hollande limits itself to including banalities, indicating that the codevelopment will allow solving the &quot;problem of the migration&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea about the immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps profitable electorally, but it economically comes out very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As indicate the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a wide consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth, the salaries and the employment in the countries that receive immigrant. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limitation of the immigration weakens the growth and damages the employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The related fears with the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace the national workers, particularly to the little qualified ones, pressing its salaries so that they are reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But the experience proves that, in fact, the immigrants are more or complementary that substitutes of the national workers and exert mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The little qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where the formation does not satisfy the demand for staff. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on the salaries </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country that it has falta of anesthetists, the complementariness among national and immigrant provokes that the arrival of these last is influential positively in the salaries and the employment of the national ones. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Taking into account the previous, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of the migratory flows means a rise of the long-term real wages of among one 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And, without taking the fact that the diversity that the immigrants provide contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economic growth (there is a great proportion of naturalized American prizes Nobel and companies as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants) into account. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The immigrants are also net contributors to the social systems, since they provide 1% of the total budget of average in the European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Organization of the Work calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant that arrives with an age of 30 years will carry out a net contribution (admissions less expenses) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets of average during all its life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> At the beginning of its mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to look for the points of growth that it lacked &quot;with the teeth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These teeth, which dissuaded the immigrants, had exactly the inverse effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented the democracy, alone misses it to think in a European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The democracy is one well precious, but also fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember that since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some perhaps believed that, so that definitely the democracy triumphed on its enemies, exerting the vote would be sufficient and in the possible most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, from Napoleón &quot;the Small&quot;, that it was something thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for the democracy, is not sufficient by itself alone and even it can convert in an &quot;instrument of oppression&quot;, as it said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot formerly. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Not, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis that we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to be converted in a political and democratic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The recantation of the true-false Greek referendum had, about this, a double revealing effect: showed the worrisome sensation of its impossibility, about its incongruence, the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence to surpass it must be reflected on. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle at present have moved and that, in many cases, the republican soldiers do not advance any longer in the good sense. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We will not go out winning if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and untidily. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or one high to the emptiness of the nationalistic hole: what options for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> Not, we do not want to take knocks of effect, but a common exercise, of right, calm and continuous plenary session, of the options and the democracy, this time at scale European. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is not crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because alone there is a crisis, the crisis of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> The whole of Europe is the one that is folded to the orders to the markets and to the agencies of qualification, that the one that suffers its impotence and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> The one that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere is the ensemble of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the one that loses slowly the sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations is all Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The most urgent thing is that the popular sovereignty recovers the rudder of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because only joint will be able the Europeans to reduce the peso of its debts, to be released of the markets and to prepare its future through the inversions. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit of the crisis will require decisions to European scale that they will not be able to take without a total democratic legitimacy, except that it is to drive us to the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After having fought for a lot of time against this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, all the world asks at present for a European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> That like this or. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think in it without a bigger political and democratic integration, and without its being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would take us to a new neutral gear. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must assume a new stage of the European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To build the Republic in France, it was necessary &quot;to do&quot; republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution caused by interests would not be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson keeps being applicable. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe more integrated from the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Only, a real European popular sovereignty, will be able to be achieved building a more democratic Europe in the political plan. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> To build Europe, let&apos;s do Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> The cards with chip &quot;without contact&quot; generalize </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The world room of the cards of chip begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In fact, 2011 he should finish with an increase of 11% in the world sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, telephones with cards SIM, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations of the cabinet Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The most powerful segment is that of the technology without contact, that it allows to pay the transport in common or the purchases simply bringing the card to a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year 460 million cards with chip will be sold in all the world without contact, ¡320 millions more that the previous year! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Its fee should keep increasing in 2012 (580 million units are foreseen) and to represent near of 10% of the world market of the cards with chip (6.925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe, which it takes a lot of time left behind with regard to the region of Asia-Pacific, is gaining ground in the sector of the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> About 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 terminals of payment. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards Visa are being used without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But the hypermarkets work for four. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has emitted this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To put the superior course, however, it is necessary that the banks put them availably of its customers. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;There are two big French establishments that have been jeopardized to spread systematically in the future, among its customers, endowed bank cards of the system without contact,&quot; announces Gérard Nébouy, chief operating officer of Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> The banks prove the payment for mobile telephone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But so alone constitutes a first stage towards the mean of payment of the future: the mobile telephone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> At present, there are few devices equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication), essential to carry out the transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> They &quot;are falling behind&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But he should experience at last a real apogee next year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We foresee that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 in all the world&quot;, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks take the front. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a proof between December and the next June in Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a cover that allows the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasburg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the Société générale has also stated yesterday that she is preparing the commercialization of an offer which it allows its customers to pay without contact through its mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Of the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front goes in increase </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris worries about the links among TO the Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on which it was suspected since some time ago, have been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, the Algerian Viceminister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers already &quot;has the certainty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> The mode &quot;in which both organizations operate and&quot; that &quot;the reports of the services of intelligence prove &quot;that&quot; they &quot;are &quot;cooperating&quot; en, explained, without providing more details. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to arrive to a similar conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The research on the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have renewed the footbridges. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey for related people with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory they died the day after together with several of its kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubbles of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The study of the calls carried out indicates towards several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers collected especially the interest of the investigators: one drives to a Nigerian that remained for a lot of time in Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other one to a man that, supposedly, is near to Aqmi and to the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It is a progress, but we must undoubtedly wait to possess more formal proofs before talking about operative cooperation among Aqmi and Boko Haram&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We know since years ago that the sect enjoys financial support and intellectual exterior and that every time is more active&quot;, states Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> These last months, these &quot;supports&quot; had been more and more evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in its operative modes, which now imply the use of kamikazes or every time more complex explosive devices and of the same style as the ones used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting for Washington, is pressing since then Abuya so that it takes the problems generated by Boko Haram into account. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering to the group as a community of illuminated little worthy of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A fast success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded on 2002 in Maiduguri about a mosque, a school and to the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, &quot;the occidental education is a sin&quot;), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is living a fast success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It politicizes and requires a strict respect of the sharia, whereas its militants throw themselves to the fight against the impious central government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> In the first place these last ones are orientated to the churches, the bars, the administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were specially lively and the attacks against the police stations multiplied. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuya was generalized, as it usually happens. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army attacked the city and 800 dead people were registered. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Since then, the sect is radicalized and she leaves its fiefs of the north. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> The last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 dead people in Jos and, afterwards, another in Abuya. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, Boko Haram attacks against Abuya, particularly against the headquarters protected from the police, with a suicidal attack, the first of this type, again. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations turns into its first international goal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, that it would cover from Mauritania up to Somalia happening for Nigeria, restless to all the specialists of the safety. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Whereas Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram rises up as a new threat in the center of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with the President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned it against Boko Haram and he has stated that it was ready &quot;to share all the information&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to the republican candidates to the Presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> In relation to China, with Iran and with the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simpleness and lack of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis, can he manage a complex world with ideas simple or, even, simplistic? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Listening to the republican candidates for the presidential ones, the electors could think that like this is. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Since some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, ago Rick Perry and the other candidates every time do more thunderous declarations and shortcuts on the subject of foreign policy, traditionally a strength of the republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> The mottos are extended, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the help to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the candidate better situated in the career towards the designation through the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened with taking to the Chinese before OMC and denouncing them &quot;for manipulation of its exchange&quot;, a subject nails in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector towards Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> It makes no difference if that implies the explosion of a trade war, stated. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who possesses a sophisticated vision of the foreign policy, almost drowns in the face of an attitude that &quot;crushes&quot; the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He has asked for a firm, but constructive dialogue, with Peking (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, which remains stagnant in the depths of the surveys, keeps being inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> To the style of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions do not manage to interrupt its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I go out chosen, I will stop to Iran&quot;, boasted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama goes out re-elected, they will have the bomb&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> He promised likewise to increase the military help to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with its duties in relation to that member. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The businessman Herman Cain, the second better classified candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of such subjects for its part. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, he urged Chinese soldier to counteract the threat because Peking &quot;tries to develop nuclear capacity&quot;, in an apparent way being unaware of the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to take part in Iran, says that, on its part, it is American ready to display the army in Mexico to fight against the cartels of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann also advocate the resource to the torture against the terrorist suppositions, forbidden by Obama in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The differences are considerable with the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a peso weighed in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that it gained the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They remember that the Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston on the subject of fight against the terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist, with reason on the failure of its naive dialogue with Iran, in the exit precipitated of the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq and in its distortions in Libya, and label it of weak one. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But they do not find the attacks simple. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population rather judges positive in a way the balance of national safety of Obama, which it finished with Bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> From Iraq, he mistrusts the military interventions that generate a collapse. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct economically America to resuscitate its leadership, Obama gives the impression of to be more exactly. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new door of entry of the Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The gas pipeline Nord Stream, that it communicates directly Europe occidental with Russia passing through the bottom of the sea Baltic, it has already set in service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It must supply gas to satisfy the needs for thirty million homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian giant of the gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with big pomp. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, included four Heads of State and of Government, took part to edges of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate bufet, in the opening of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly Russia with Germany, under the sea. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the First French Minister François Fillon and its counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the occidental net of Europe joint. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new gas pipeline, every year will arrive 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas additional to Europe occidental through one first had of 1,224 km that communicate the region of San Petersburgo with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> It should be concluded at the end of 2012 by a second tube that it will allow supplying a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is, sufficient to cover all the French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Besides, people already talk about the possibility to build a third tube for the same tour. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the ending in time of this enormous work it presents airs of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Poland and the Baltic countries had opposed the project firmly. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> In fact, the Nord Stream is going to allow supplying Germany with gas directly, preventing the terrestrial course for third countries (Poland and Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> At once, these two countries waste something of its power: for them, it will be more difficult to be influential in Russia threatening it with closing the occidental access to the markets of Europe for her. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> In the decisive point of the debate, Warsaw did not doubt to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new Germanic-Soviet pact&quot;, with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is, if the subject is politically delicate. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Europe occidental, supporting the Russian project, it has obtained a bigger safety of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy, since the project has generated a gap among the Europeans of the east and of the west. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has known, in so alone five years, to do to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich occidental countries, big consumers of gas and with some every time more limited reservations. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This gas pipeline constitutes a component of our association with Russia a new artery that joins us organically&quot;, confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the gas pipeline, proving up to which point the big contracts of the sector of the gas are as political as economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smiles in the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, in the point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline also means a technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The submarine tube is manufactured of steel covered with cement to protect it against the anchors of the ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It leans on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 m of depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields that date from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> It &quot;was necessary to withdraw or to destroy&quot; a hundred them, &quot;for precaution&quot;, indicates Jens Müller, spokesman of the society Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Likewise, it was necessary to carry the measures of protection of the fauna and the flora to extremes. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 towers Eiffel and is not interrupted in all its length: neither for valves, nor for stations of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> It was in the waters of Sweden a platform of control foreseen, but the ones responsible for the project renounced it when seeing that the Swedes were not very ready to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea in front of its coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the event of breakdown, we will interrupt the gas thread in less than one minute&quot;, needs Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of escape, the gas of the gas pipeline will be released, therefore, at the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But the builders consider little probable that it is produced an escape, since they have foreseen joints that, according to the forecasts, will have an escape every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed through a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which carries out exterior inspections, as well as through a device that circulates through the interior of the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> With the form of one pure, is introduced in the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> On its arrival, after three complete days of journey at a speed of three meters per second, it supplies precise data on possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without the need for any type of repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> At first it is of 200 bars and, on the exit of 100 bars. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined its forces to be able to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the participations. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> To it, the Germans E.ON and BASF were joined (15.5% each), like this as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five societies have created a common company, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploiting the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition is specially favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Afterwards, Gazprom rented to this society, during a deadline of twenty-five years renewable, the whole of the transport capacities of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Precise Jens Müller &quot;will pay Gazprom for the total capacity, independently of the quantity of gas that really&quot; is &quot;transported&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been taken I finish by 30% with the contribution of the stockholders and by 70% through bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work should reach 7,400 million euros for both tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For example, for GDF Suez the inversion has reached the 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But the minority stockholders are sure of their not surpassing its inversion, since Gazprom assumes the risk of the expenses by itself alone. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, in a sandy coast planted of pines. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Some valves, with 4.5 meters of height, form the door of exit of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are some sensors that measure the pressure, the temperature and the characteristics specific to the gas on the arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> From the last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At total capacity, they will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a branded notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return the people the taste for the writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notebook Moleskine is recognized easily, with its black rectangular pastes, its gum, its leaves of broken white color, as aged by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> However, the notebooks Moleskine with the current aspect were born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Mode Mode, based on Milan, decided in that moment to launch a notebook of notes of design, but distinguished to the market. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, at that time consultant of the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook is inspired by an old technique of production, the block skin (skin of mole), who is referred to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the stools. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of notebook was very valued by the writers and the travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an object old and an icon of the avant-garde artists forgotten until the 20th century&quot;, account Maria Sebregondi, which since then was converted in responsible for the brand in Mode Mode. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> And it reached the success. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26%, until they reached a volume of 12.7 million sold units. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Far the confidential production of the first years has remained, in which alone were designed 3,000 notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook of notes attracts businessmen as much as to estudiantes and professional. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> As Moleskine, its users are cosmopolites, of open spirit and cults. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The Italian small enterprise, which counted on twelve workers in its beginnings, now has nearly 100 and, from 2008, it has two offices: one in Milan and the other one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> He distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac up to the small trades of the center of the cities, and has known how to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> We have adapted at the times and to the need to write, in spite of the apogee of the electronic mail,&quot; explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural firm goes from the hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects or artists expose its own notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, it launched likewise a notebook with covers of leopard, for the Festival of cinema of Locarno. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Its success and this making use of cultural aura, Moleskine has known how to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, covers of computer... The brand includes a wide range of supports. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that provokes envy: in fall of 2006, Mode Mode went acquired for the background of inversion SG Capital Europe, at present Syntegra Capital, a new page being written like this in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why does the unemployment rate of the disabled workers keep being so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Around 19% of the disabled people they are looking for an employment. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The XV Week for the employment of the disabled ones it starts today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> In spite of a solved public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, in front of 9% for the ensemble of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;Not&quot;, states Éric Blanchet, chief operating officer of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled ones. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The breakthroughs reached since fifteen years ago are considerable. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;In that then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;However, it still remains very much because it does&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> One may mention that the disabled unemployed ones keep facing numerous obstacles to access the employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They usually have a more advanced age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% of average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a little high level of qualification: 80% has not finished the high school and, of the 2.3 million students in the superior education, so alone 10,000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the longstanding stop is very extended among them: 53% for the disabled ones, in front of 38% of average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> That is, there are numerous questions that obstruct especially the return to the work world and that &quot;constitute the essence of the problem&quot;, indicates Christian Grapin, chief operating officer of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the companies hire disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Those are the objective obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Besides, there are those that are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study carried out in April for the association IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité indicated that the interviewed directors have &quot;a level of knowledge on the disabilities low&quot;, with an &quot;excessive representation of the people in wheelchair, deficient physicists or intellectuals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result: the private enterprises with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal to hire 6% of disabled workers, goal that was fixed in a law of... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> According to the last available ciphers, which date from 2008, they reach a relation of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now we reach about 3%&quot;, indicates Pierre Blanc, chief operating officer of Agefiph, the organism responsible for raising the contributions of the companies that do not respect this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof: the number of establishment submitted to this contribution&quot;, the same as the amounts paid out, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, passing from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for the companies&quot;, explains Pierre Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflects a real consciousness, particularly among the great groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Work, so alone 59% of the societies that between 20 and 49 workers possess account with disabled employees in its staff, in front of 82% of the companies of between 100 and 199 workers. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;A joy&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> To point of the Bleus being confronted with on Tuesday at night (20 h 45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not conceal the pleasure that generates this friendly match for them. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We will not dare to say that connivance among them was noticed, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting one beside the other one, in the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really done the peaces. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months afterwards of the gesture of grudge of his front against Turkey, the Belgian selector does not have more than praises for it. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I cheered up a lot for Eden, by its breakthroughs and because he is a Belgian.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to advance&quot;, answers the front one of Lille to him. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> As for the contrast among its presentations in its equipment and in the selection, it &quot;is an ensemble&quot;, has justified. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;In Lille, am all the year, which does not apply to Belgium, I. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;Tengo &quot;to situate&quot; me, which. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Called for to play against Romania on Friday at night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for, at last, &quot;to shine&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without forgetting the &quot;pleasure&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> It has been cheering the Bleus up since it had seven years, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I have always been its fan&quot;, states. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> Undoubtedly, that is going to reinforce especially the &quot;particular&quot; character of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Especially because it will be confronted &quot;with Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)&quot;, remembers. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We have just faced not long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Always to play against them is a joy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> With simplicity, Leekens has referred for its part to the &quot;pride&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; because it plays &quot;a full match&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; because because it proves, as &quot;neighbor&quot;, that France &quot;is an equipment of very high level&quot; again, nearly one year after the traumatism of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a formidable work&quot;, said with enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Whereas Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share airplane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our small Belgians are growing&quot;, stood out. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;We are building something; the players are ambitious, are hungry. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;They will be able to see it in the next matches&quot;. The match included against France. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal shows a lot of confidence </seg>
<seg id="2985"> The Portugal of Paulo Bento is confronted with a great optimism to the match of turn against Bosnia (22 h 00), that will be celebrated on Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> In the match of departure, both equipments lacked realism. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;When they go by these 90 minutes, we will be a happy equipment and, especially, a happy country&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> It does not have any doubt; the Selecçao, that it directs since September 2010, is going to be qualified for the Euroglass of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Indeed, so alone 90 minutes separate to Portugal of the happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a match to stake and a competitor, Bosnia, to defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> Taking the match of departure (0-0) into account, on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems evident that the thing is not decided. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal dominated the match during more than one hour, yes, but it could not score the valuable goal that had given him the calmness. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> It &quot;is a good result, but at the same time entails a risk, since we have not marked it went of home&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home, in the luminous Stadium of the Light of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will spend, before a public that should be just as thrilled, even if it works out evident that the match &quot;is very similar&quot;, dixit an optimistic but brilliant Bento. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We expect the match to be very similar, but we are convinced that we can take the front completely&quot;, the Portuguese coach of 42 years testified. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;We keep having 50% of possibilities to take part in the Euroglass 2012&quot;, has, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The draw of Friday in Bosnia obliges to the Portuguese to mark and to win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> A draw could arrive for them to the Bosnians, although they also have need to mark. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> It &quot;is a good result, but at the same time entails a risk, since we have not marked it went of home&quot;, regrets Bento. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We are going to play against an equipment that has a great technical quality and that has of players with a great individual quality&quot;, added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians &quot;not to leave them time to think&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea, as long as, this time, is realistic. </seg>
