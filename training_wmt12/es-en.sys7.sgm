<seg id="90"> Without breakfast but with stuffed to have dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> The specialists notify that, in a healthy development, they are important, besides, the details, that also count, as for example to have a fixed hour for the breakfast in family. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In Chequia, nevertheless, alone the 23% of the families of students they have breakfast to the same hour. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In the majority of the families, each one has breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> But the worse thing was to discover that in the 10% of the homes has breakfast nothing. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is, nevertheless, the base of a correct daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The study shows that in the families of obese children they are consumed with a lot of more frequency the insane french fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost all - independently of the weight - drink daily sweet refreshments (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> By guideline they do sport more than the 40% of the polled children, nevertheless, among its parents this result is reduced to less than the half, alone the 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> You manufacture you your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> The following phase of the study enabled that the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) were created their own diets from all the possible offerings according to their inclinations and opinions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The eating preferences of the Czech children in ages understood between the 12 and 15 years, since the point of view of a healthy diet, they are very far away of the ideal thing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite food the paste, the meat and the candies are found </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;It is above all alarming the popularity of the sweet refreshments&quot;, is notified in the final report of the study. </seg>
<seg id="104"> As main food is carried the palm the paste and the meat of bird continues him closely. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Practically, the children reject always the legume and the flavor by the fish and the greenness is very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Change to healthy habits </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the study shows that the children are willing to change its eating habits if receive the just information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the control group of the participants in the study, that filled the questionnaire after finishing the program of prevention&quot; The obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, was given in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet&quot;, is aimed in the results of the study. </seg>
<seg id="109"> It calls the attention, for example, the relating to the sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer the current and normal water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children would also elect with more frequency in the questionnaire the meat of bird and the fish for the main food and they would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the by-products of flour. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The stylist should be also a good psychologist, they maintain the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article, How do they learn the stylists, already I complained a little that the initial lessons already were quite loaded. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Did not have neither idea of how would go that. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress problematic personages and, besides, a seminar on how functions in the show business. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The more fence they are the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us </seg>
<seg id="117"> And although the course develops each Saturday and Sunday, no longer fits a pin. </seg>
<seg id="118"> We are time we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how dress the woman that does not have a perfect symmetry. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And thus is the great majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone is short-necked, someone has a figure stylized without the adequate curves and someone suffers excess. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The stylist should know to smooth out optically some wide shoulders, to extend a neck or to amuse the necessary curves </seg>
<seg id="122"> Certain tricks have given us on how cause to emphasize the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of chests and enormous hips but waist I tighten and at the same time not to dress it of a too defiant way </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or the pants do not adapt, is worth while to cause to sew at least an extra fabric piece to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Without doubt they will not repent, because the clothes that sits down perfectly is unpayable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> With a skirt to measure he will feel a lot better than with a that not for to be moved, to be raised, he dances in the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The body stylized can be permitted to dress clothes with folds, decorations, embroidered or draped. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are certainly many types of diverse informations and of bodies, so I am happy that I have all the week to sort out my head all this information. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And even thus, I am afraid that with the task assigned, already I have more than to spare. </seg>
<seg id="129"> To each participant in the course they have been assigned him two famous, to the ones that should design two wardrobes: one for the day and another for the night. </seg>
<seg id="130"> One must keep in mind the current aspect, the fashionable style that be adapted the person in question. </seg>
<seg id="131"> It has touched me &quot;to dress&quot; to Miranda Kerr, perhaps know it of the campaign of Victory&apos; s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Shout inside, for me is a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Eyrie, that ultimately there will be grown fat some a hundred kilograms (please, they keep in mind the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gómez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The dresses we have to trim them of the magazines or to seek them on the internet and to print them, for later devise them graphic. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The moodboard, that is like is called to the espresso, complete result besides our personal style and our relation with the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Is important also to think about the graphic part of the fashion design. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist, therefore, did not you see alone physically, but also is occupied, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (of concrete themes, like tendencies, bags, shelters, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Of all it spoke us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But all this already remains for Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The stylist should have a global vision. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with informations above all type of bodies. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashionable photographer Ben. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub recalled us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know him to remove party to this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a good stylist knows to work with a same article of clothing of diverse forms. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The changeability is, in this case, fundamental. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Thus, the such raincoat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can dress to it classic with cattlemen and undershirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with high-heeled shoes and to photograph it as if were in reality a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or well it suffices to tuck it and to rise the neck to obtain a completely different image. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;You play with it&quot;, he insisted us. </seg>
<seg id="148"> What more I value is the following counsel: &quot;To begin to work, does lack that first know all the rules&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then already you can break them&quot;, he said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> At last it remains me clearly why do we memorize all those formulae, what combines with what, why, if then it so happens that in the fashion magazines we find us different results. </seg>
<seg id="151"> That without speaking of the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve of the one that intends to photograph. </seg>
<seg id="153"> Thus, for a fashionable history that have ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), one must have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And besides that the photos the clothes functions in combination with other tokens, all they different to the ones that are used in the reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> All it one must keep in mind at the moment of to design the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and the style suppose they alone, in many cases, the half of the success. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Suffices to look at to Madonna, that is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have done of her a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Chequia, for the moment, there is not still a clear tendency to use the services of the stylists. </seg>
<seg id="159"> To the famous personages also they find the useless (my abilities suffice me, my physical aspect does not have so much importance). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And when someone ask us our services, one must keep in mind that is very probable that they indicate us a very different size to his real (smaller). </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then alone it remains guglear and to ascertain if the gossip magazines already have written on the theme, if a certain fame grows fat/makeed thin, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted us that to the stylist does not suffice him to be oriented in the fashion, but he has to understand of outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> During its work, above all should communicate with the people to which you saw, for which is fundamental to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> It knows to value to the people, itself is not done of less, defends its opinions. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a director hires you so that classify him the wardrobe and are completed it with pretty tokens, cannot catch and to throw everything that there was and to say: &quot;Huy what horror&quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You find at least a pair of things that can praise and to recommend so that someone can be put them&quot;, he says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He himself also showed us that all he should fit in the call &quot;placovka&quot;, that is to say, the market of work. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This themselves fixed around the waist and have there all the necessary tools. </seg>
<seg id="169"> They are objects like scissors, as scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There is also thread of nylon (that serves the stylist during the products photos session such that bags or caps), special pincers of coupling of tokens in front, if this was greater (the pins and another type of couplings they are not permitted, therefore they would be able to damage the weaving), or a play of dressmaking. </seg>
<seg id="170"> For remain us not in it passive listens and to put something in practice, we have learned to cover the sole with the shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and a lot more still the outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And we did not do more than covering and to cover. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We could not touch the shoes with the scissors for damage them not by accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So there was that to be very skillful. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has given me a happiness upon praising my work without reserves. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The truth is that themselves they are not given me very well those abilities. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is alone a small part of all the ones that have listened during all the weekend, in the second part of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Already I have given me account that to dedicate me to the fashion design to professional level is not a road of rose, but gives me exactly equal what the people say. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed: The Run competes for every America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It reviews </seg>
<seg id="181"> A trip, in unworried principle, is complicated on account of a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during the shift of tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="182"> To a certain extent managed to cover itself the expectations, but it does not serve you&apos;re welcome, if, in reality, did not intend to do extraordinary nothing. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new delivery, to which to the title is added The Run, awoke large expectations already before its premiere. </seg>
<seg id="184"> It promised that would give new air to the old saga of careers Need for Speed and, because of it shown, appears like a play that should not finish being again a kind of action without more. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Also we feel curious by knowing how would remain the scenes inserted, where the main personage descends of the car and he walks for his own foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As it is used to happening in the series of NFS, the results do not vary much with respect to what we expected us. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in the total computation points on account of absurd failures are lost, that already come appearing in the series since years ago. </seg>
<seg id="188"> In reality not itself neither to call errors, but rather, it is a matter of the incomprehensible reluctance of the programmers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> It is introduced you in a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to resolve them, him is offered to participate in an illegal career for every America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sit down to the steering wheel in the western coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive the first to New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is to offer somewhat interesting. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten phases and, then, in more than fifty careers. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Of it it is deduced that each career considers place a different route and the phases are located in different environments, that turn out to be quite diverse and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> That way, one does not have neither vaguely the sensation that the play offer always the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the environments they turn out to be even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore, is not swum of the other world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the walk by the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Besides, the careers are diversified occasionally by an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> Thus, for example, in the desert you find you a sandstorm that diminishes the visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> On the other hand, in the mountains one must be careful so that you not an avalanche bury. </seg>
<seg id="202"> According to that, each one of the careers is very well developed. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Alone there is a pair of models, but with that suffices. </seg>
<seg id="204"> During a moment, you try to be in advance of a quantity of rival required (the normal thing in a classical career), later try to win time (classical sorrow timed) and then a sorrow against a single adversary expects you. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In the middle of all this the police appears at times, that does not do but to complicate still more the things. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The news are the landscapes out of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, should escape from someone and you have to help it, always pressing the at the moment just just button. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Complicated nothing. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It turns out to be surprising, nevertheless, that have enough less landscapes in the play of what goatish to expect (in concrete there is alone three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> But the final result is positive, because this element does not come be uncomfortable and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that do that the play turn out to be more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of conduction continues the tracks of the previous episodes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That means that to day of today no longer be much, but itself cannot be affirmed that be evil. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you seek a realistic simulation, already can seek in another part. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But to a career conceived with plenty of action agrees the enough this style of conduction, although we will be able to find somewhat better among the play of the competence. </seg>
<seg id="215"> To here, all in order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems arise after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> As opposed to the correct thing of the models of conduction, no longer the same thing with the collisions occurs. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Of play of this type it is not possible to expect that amuse deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not all is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> It is typical that, upon doing a very adjusted progress or to circulate the car with a so alone, normal traffic there be light close contacts, but in other almost identical situations, your car finishes doing pirouettes descontroladas. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even it finishes completely destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system of reseteo, not large problems arise, but can put you in a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The reseteos are planned in such a way that, when you have an accident or leave the trail, the play returns you to the last point of rescue in the trail. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Nevertheless, in each alone career has five reseteos available. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If you consume them all, have to resume the career since the principle. </seg>
<seg id="225"> Thus therefore is not more than an aid in the event that something go not well, but is not very to give credit. </seg>
<seg id="226"> At times, neither the reseteo helps, alone aid the to be learned the phase given by memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> A great disadvantage of the play is that the same facts are repeated in different places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> In some curves, for example, one must enter of a specific way; of another way, they are impossible to take. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Other times you find you in some place vehicles &quot;civil&quot; always with the same configuration, although be the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This does of rabiar above all in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the encounter in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when arrive, should rotate or well to brake. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is equal when arrive, because is planned because the &quot;surprise&quot; will always happen in front of your noses. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The adversaries have besides an advantage more. </seg>
<seg id="233"> During all the departure you will arrive at places where, without keep in mind the moment, always the same adversary in the same place will advance you. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Besides this occurs in the end of the departure, in a long bridge, which results still more shocking. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Your opponent should arrive before that you, to the price that be. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it goes in front of you, the vision of the cars complicates you that come forward, so at the beginning you can do baby food the car. </seg>
<seg id="237"> The idea to create he can be understood a play with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you immediately. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And is a grief, because although the model of the trip be simple, the play is amused and with action, so that often is not possible to continue to the detail what happens neither where. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And really it gives equal, if the merit is carried the idea with fifty exclusive trails or the classification in the career so that fit not the boredom, or any another thing. </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the change of cars during the careers. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You have to be attentive to the gas pumps next to the highway, because exactly there have to change of car, although in the great majority of the cases will suffice you what have. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports are adequate for urban zones, the self-strong American for the straight freeways and the exotic superdeportivos for a technical conduction, for example, by highways of mountain with curves. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Besides main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is to say, there are careers in concrete places that you will know for the histories. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here you will obtain not alone medals, but also points of experience for your profile, that serves so much for the challenges as the stories. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Upon reaching the upper level, the conductor are opened him several possibilities, beginning for the car and to putting an end to funds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> At the same time, to have connected a function Autolog in line, that compares your results with the of other players and disponibiliza other common functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the most difficult elements to understand is how is done the last career in the history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> With the car you arrive to the tunnel of the meter (even), where begin to run in the dark by the ways (even). </seg>
<seg id="250"> The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (even) and, suddenly, from behind the convoy of the meter arrives you and is carried you in front without more. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In the editing surely we will have a discussion on this during several days, on if during the programming of the not a single play thought even a little or if the authors truly take us for a panda of fools. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical part of the play is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in pleasant most cases, at times to proud. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Therefore what a pity that, in the most tense moments the quality of image is reduced and, from time to time, of a serious way. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This affects above all to the accidents where to have involved many participants, when the quality of continuous image no longer is valid. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The audio is well and the soundtrack is a question of inclinations. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In order to that be of the I please to most of the youthful group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each one of its father and of its mother&quot;, but can be supposed that nobody would buy the alone play by its music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the play avoided absolutely foolish errors, we would have problems in affirming that The Run is the best play of NFS of recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> It gives the sensation that the play be not concluded. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The diversion is insured, but you prepare you because the errors will strike you in the eyes with the force of some reflectors of airport. </seg>
<seg id="261"> The choruses of the University Carolina will participate in the concert &quot;Students of Velvet&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="276"> The ambassador before the EU, Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation of negativistas and Eurosceptic. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The they tried Lisbon has affected significantly to the equilibrium among the individual institutions&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;Did not he expect me that an all-out war was mounted&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will last five, six years, before the situation be stabilized a little, calm and the new players be accustomed to its new roles&quot;, thus began with conviction its conference in the Faculty of Right the Czech ambassador before the EU, Milena Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How be not taken in serious its motto &quot;clear and openly on Europe&quot;, that said already in the first part of its conference, when each organ of the EU he managed to describe and its relations with such precision and clarity, therefore would be the envy of many conferenciantes of the Faculty of Right of the U. Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Vicenová also praised the work from of the new permanent president of the European Counsel, Herman go Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;The first thing the criticisms arise, that if is insipid, a capable, gray official to assume any role, but I should to say that left all disconcerted, because assumes its roles to the perfection&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;It is a man that knows to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, to be communicated with them and that he has a very clear vision from where should go the EU&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of representative of the foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: &quot;¿Who is this EU? Why number I can call it?&quot;. Treats therefore of an important step toward the unification and the clarification from of the political union with a view toward States as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to prohibit us the cheese of Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová has been occupied also of the agenda continued, continues and will continue the European Counsel in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs were in charge of the emerging economic crisis, they resolved the crisis of the gas and they organized a summit for the Oriental Association. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government at that time was identified like a very negative aspect, that affected seriously to Chequia. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU considers the moment many commitments. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In words of the ambassador: &quot;A good disturbance&quot;, not alone the presidency, but also the financial crisis, that is treating now. </seg>
<seg id="293"> On the other hand, one must approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current a lot more complicated, economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="294"> If the budget is simpler and effective, ¿what sectors will take precedence, what countries will receive greater support and which less? That is something that been present in the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador recalled also his main mottoes, with the ones that he arrived at Europe: &quot;About Europe with clarity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;The certain thing is that i do not they like the ugly abbreviations, the foreign expressions or the slangs that the people does not understand&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;¿How does it be able a citizen to understand that in Brussels not the cucumbers are invented truly the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of diverse sizes or that nobody is going to prohibit us the cheese of Olomouc?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="298"> Also it intends to remove more benefit of the environment of the EU and to approach more Czech citizens to the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> The Europe of the velocities expects us </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the ambassador, the Czechs have fame of Eurosceptics and the people perceives more well the negative aspects that the positive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Besides, regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault is of multitude of factors, like the modesty of our candidates, her incapacity to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Besides the success of the Czech presidency, put of relief the force and the contribution of the Group of Visegrad. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Créanme that when they respond to me a Pole and a Hungarian and itself me about a Slovak, a French beside me tells me: “¿Qué, already you have remained, the of the Group of Visegrad?&quot;, and is seen that him not any grace does&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="305"> In the future, to the EU, according to Vicenová, new very hard regulations of budget policies for the member States they await him. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It is perceived like something very real of the concept of the two velocities, if they are not more, in Europe, more than the new one of &quot;the European Confederacy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have countries in the euro Zone and countries out of the euro Zone&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the space Schengen and we have besides the procedure of cooperation reinforced&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;It was told for the first time that alone they cooperate the countries that quieran and the not, that remain was&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;These procedures will be each time more and they will reinforce the Europe of the two velocities&quot;, expects Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this sense, also emphasized the role of Chequia and of Herman they go Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the themes that affect to the totality of the EU should debate among the not alone, member states among the members of the euro Zone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM initiates its second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone sought a term that to define with great precision the strategy of IBM, the most approximate one he would be &quot;long time limit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a business that is perceived like current and, nevertheless, already they have elapsed a hundred years since their foundation. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The base of this character largoplacista put it the first leader of the firm, the visionary one Thomas J. Watson Mr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he minted the motto that many problems of the world have solution if the people is willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its motto &quot;Think!&quot; became its seal, around which will go building the life of the gigantic future (was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> Watson was besides the base of a culture of business carefully raised. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement in direction to the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years by that reason, because was maintained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing to the changes around. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That has permitted us, during our first century, to transform the technology, the business and the company. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We expect to prosper still more in our second century&quot;, affirmed during its anniversary, the current director of the business Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, already in the years 30, worried of the care of their employees as the businessman of in Chequia (the employees of IBM were of the first American operatives that enjoyed sure, full holidays, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewarded the better inventors and salespersons. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The same long-term sophistication maintains it IBM in the relation with the client. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Already since the principle the business knew to discover talents (upon being one of the first world businesses in put an end to any type of discrimination, could elect without problems). </seg>
<seg id="328"> In the line of the strategy antidiscriminación is the current plan of IBM, by the one that to Palmisano a woman will substitute her next year: Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She already carries working thirty years in IBM, where he has been a sales manager, marketing and strategies. </seg>
<seg id="330"> During the last years IBM has participated of the calls virtual encounters, rain of ideas in line, of the one that arise infinity of future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not to surprise that exceed ideas, therefore in the firm they work almost half million of people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> The fixed position in the business provides to the company a strong external and internal image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;Since the principle, IBM maintained a concept of institution more than of technological business&quot;, affirms the economist teacher of the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technological business, but a business that tries to resolve problems of business for users of the technology&quot;, states George Colony of the consulting one Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the own business says exists a difference among entering the business and to create directly a business. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;Great Green&quot; - as it he is known in the United States family on account of his logo, he has become the last a hundred years in one of the greater businesses of the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> Is possibly the most versatile technological business (develops as much teams as programs, infrastructures and web lodging services inside an extensive range of services, that go from servants to nanotechnology). </seg>
<seg id="339"> It shows off the major number of patents of all the American technological businesses and five of its employees have received the Nobel prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among their inventions they are found the ATM, the cards of payment, the financial exchanges, the bar codes and the disquetes. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM will invoice this year 220 thousand million dollars. This year has become the second signs technological by capitalization of market (the first one is Apple), when surpassed for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking at to the future </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all the products and innovations have just satisfied the flavor of the clients and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, YOU/2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr). </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If its business is based on advancing, cannot be anchored emotionally in the past&quot;, recognized Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM does not have problems in building its bases in other platforms (and likewise, if do not they function, abandons them). </seg>
<seg id="346"> And it the difference of the competence, Microsoft, that basically is maintained and falls always exclusively with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Technology of future </seg>
<seg id="348"> In question of sales, IBM is dedicated above all to services, of the ones that approximately a fifth part they are of programs and another fifth one of teams. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With all, still in 1990 the teams they represented more than the half of the quota of the suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000, IBM has sold assets of low performance by a total value of 15 thousand million dollars. During in the same period, has invested 58 thousand million dollars in the future technology purchase. </seg>
<seg id="351"> The investments have followed since 2008, when for the first time the modern world financial crisis was declared. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM acts according to the premises of its first leader, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29 enlarged the investments. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It seems that up to now the business IBM has known to escape the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the actions of IBM since the start of the year 2008 has grown stratospherically to a 120%, the net profit of the business has not left to enlarge. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The currency of IBM is to change it all, save its value. </seg>
<seg id="356"> It is able, therefore, to expect that when come the following crisis, this flexible giant will endure. </seg>
<seg id="357"> History of IBM: since the cutter of cheeses to the spatial flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> The business IBM (International Business Machines) was based on New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The name IBM is adopted already in the year 1924 - originally was a matter of a mark utilized in the branch offices of Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The base that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises of the fusion of four businesses that went back to the decade of 1880. </seg>
<seg id="361"> It possessed inventions as the famous one &quot;timeclock&quot;, that permits to control the entrance and exit of the employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new business was the businessman Chat Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also he presided his counsel supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint put on file the leader of a business of the competence, Thomas J. Watson, so that helped it with the management of the business. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson continue being the firm base on the one that are supported the culture and corporate identity). </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson directed the business to the year 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, just as indicates its name, began with the production and sale of all kinds of apparatuses for business, from cutters of meat and cheese to boxes cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the four first years that Watson directed the business, the billing was duplicated in 9 million dollars and began the great expansion of the business by the continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so crucial for the business that, almost after forty years occupying the chair of the leader, was substituted by its son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under its direction, IBM began to work in the development of the artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the years 60 the personnel and the computers of IBM helped the NASA to guide the flights to the space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon). </seg>
<seg id="371"> In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classics &quot;pecés&quot;, that established the standard of computers of that time, they arrived at the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese business Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the part of consultancy of the business Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and services of highly value added. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that has paid IBM these three last years is the concept Smarter Planet, that is to say, &quot;a more intelligent planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its objective is to do a rationaler use of the technology, although not yet the areas have been planned neither has improved the circumstances, for example, in the relating to the transportation and the administration of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> For the sector of the commerce, IBM presented does not do a lot of the platform &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; that permits the retailers to negotiate the complete commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a long history in this country. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Already in 1932 it opened a branch office in the Czechoslovakia of then, the first country that had it in the Europe Central and Oriental. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today here, the IBM operates besides the strategic center of outsourcing in Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The headquarters for Europe Central and Oriental has he is in Prague. Also here there is a world fame investigation team that works with the recognition of voice. </seg>
<seg id="381"> About its unfaithful husband: </seg>
<seg id="382"> Vat, you remain you to that donkey, that no longer I want it! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina (53) he said ¡he was finished! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After its husband Josef (53) had become the unique protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also its lover, Darina he continued having the hope that Josef awoke of its dream rose and would return home. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Nevertheless already it is not going to expect and has established clear rules for the life in the future. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &quot;Pepe can return home, but no longer as my couple&quot;, explained. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Darina received during the summer to Bartošové in its house, did not be able neither to be imagined how would finish its marriage. </seg>
<seg id="388"> In spite of the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after and Pepe did not abandon the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Until it declared publicly that loved it. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With time, Darina was resigned, apparently accepted the relation of its husband and even said goodbye to him for always. </seg>
<seg id="391"> To does not it import her with who goes to bed its woman. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If a day to break with Bartošová, its woman would not expect her at home with the open arms. </seg>
<seg id="393"> It is the biological father of my children and, if the remainder of its life in our house wants to live, nobody will throw him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="394"> &quot;But here he would live not already as my darling and old donkey that was mistaken, but like a man to which certain ties they unite me&quot;, he said and he added that already he had been unhitched of his husband and he insisted only in the mutual respect. </seg>
<seg id="395"> To Josef up to now her does not import that herself woman have her closed the back door. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &quot;I accept the decision of my wife&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;I will be with Iveta and there is not possible change&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="398"> &quot;My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I her respect&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="399"> &quot;The business continues in vigor, I do the arrangements of house, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="400"> &quot;Darina and I we speak us with normality, the unique thing is that we do not share bed, he said. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If he found a new love, he he would not be opposed. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;Do not we sleep together and she does not interest me, neither where does he go neither if he has some boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="403"> Already I know that is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I assume all the responsibility&quot;, concludes Josef. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices of the women: Also they refer you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If you ask the men that be capable of citing some typical vices of the women, in general each one of them will name them without thinking. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Beloved women, ¿you recognize you in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to cause to boil the blood to the males? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Going shopping </seg>
<seg id="408"> It reproaches to its orange average that has dependence of the purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> It has to be bought at least a get-up in week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> He likes to buy from change in the discounts? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then in its case can be told that to go shopping has become a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women realize that should appease their passion by the purchases, at least a little. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But to see, ¿what woman would be able to resist the temptation to stroll without more by the stores of clothes, to seek well adjusted tokens and later to test them to him all in the changing room (ideally in all different colors)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Although for the majority of the women to go shopping is a hobby, for the men can be converted practically in a hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Alone it recall how many times already has said to its couple that better expect it in front of the door. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;¿I am not too fat?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;It would need to make thin at least five kilograms - ¿should begin to do exercise?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;¿Truly you flavor?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Him not these phrases they sound? </seg>
<seg id="421"> To that yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Then it is one of those women obsessed by its aspect. </seg>
<seg id="423"> It is not that you owe to stop taking care of, but many men are allergic to listen to their couple to be complained all the time of their physical aspect. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The strong sex also agrees that the more enlarges the frequency of the complaints, more bother you return the women. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The order and the cleaning in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> Is like an infinite carousel. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Cleaning the windows, to pass the vacuum, to scrub the floor, to remove the dust, to scrub the bathtub and all that at least two times for week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> It reproaches to its couple that have stepped the clean floor with a dirty foot, to its children that have dirtied a washroom recently cleaned and a bookcase with doors of glass that so much cost him to clean? </seg>
<seg id="429"> In the event that you suffer this &quot;deviation&quot;, test to be conscious that nothing should be exaggerated and that the order and the cleaning surely should not occupy to be fundamental in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This inoffensive desire of cleaning would be able to threaten its relations and the family welfare. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Commenting unpleasant </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;The shorts used are left with the dirty clothes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You want to put you also tomorrow those socks used&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;¡The cloth wet is not left on the ground!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If it does those cometarios to its couple more times to the day, know that thus will manage to remove it of its booths. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Naturally. You does not mean anything bad, alone wants to obtain that all be in order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Perhaps, if the men knew this, the women, in turn, would not do so many comments. </seg>
<seg id="438"> You slander and gossips </seg>
<seg id="439"> To some women go them also the slanders, the gossips, but also the offenses and the conspiracy against someone. </seg>
<seg id="440"> The women concentrate on the relations, therefore he likes to speak meetings of things of the type who, where, with who, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Maybe to each one of we at times escapes him itself a small and inoffensive gossip. </seg>
<seg id="442"> With the hand in the heart, this is own of almost all the women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those that themselves they are not controlled, to the ones that charms to gossip and they do it often, they despise to all and they turn out to be dangerous for the ones that they surround them, above all in a female labor team. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jágr and they helped with their assistances to conquer to the Philadelphia </seg>
<seg id="445"> The forward one of hockey Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the encounter of NHL with two assistances that brought the victory on the Philadelphia 5:3 in the court of Carolina and puts again the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition. </seg>
<seg id="446"> In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the move of the star of 39 years, and took a step more and was declared better player of the party. </seg>
<seg id="447"> It was judged two assistances in the party and also the companion of Jágr, Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="448"> After the encounter, Jágr affirmed before the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;Already before the party had said him that would do triplete&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;It felt it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;At times ambushes seem&quot;, explained Jágr, after its action gave a goal to Giroux, because of the first shot of the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trace. </seg>
<seg id="453"> It was done with the disk behind the entrance of the Hurricanes and moved it among the circles to Maxim Talbot, that put goal. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the principle of the second part already they dominated the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Concretely by Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> After collaborating with Jágr put the third goal, after its shot was strained for the room of the entrance of Wayne Simmonds. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;Do not I mean that be the best player of the court, but without doubt is among the three better&quot;, praised Jágr to its head office. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;Never itself me would have occurred that in the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman as he&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am very satisfied of it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play for him&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="462"> All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results&quot;, adds Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina still converted the party in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and after new of Dwyer, of penalty, to being put to a goal of distance. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read did not permit more complications, although they finished surpassed in number of two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Pronger had a good action in our field&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;It cleared the disk, I took velocity and Read went toward the most far away part&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to get it right to the disk and I am happy because I obtained it&quot;, described the last goal of the party just as lived it. </seg>
<seg id="468"> With its victory, Philadelphia has itself placed in head of the Conference This. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav did not he play to the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew for a wound in the upper part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Canadiens not alone lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomáš Plekanec did not know to take advantage of one of the shots. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the great quantity of injured in the last row, and to play the alone party with five defenses. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;That is evil&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We play the alone party with a veteran player, the remainder they were new&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;In short, but it is that against that nothing can be done, we have to fight with it&quot;, he said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;So much to rotate to the players returned against us, him we could not resist&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had to simplify more still the play, to remove the disk of our field&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="478"> &quot;And thus we leave holes&quot;, explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The goalkeeper Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the matted Hair Bay. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The goals of Jets were marked by five players that put thus end to a series of routs that already five parties lasted. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have they evolved the prices of the trips since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there were in the Czechoslovakia of then alone five authorized state travel agencies: Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agencies of that moment sold in most cases travel alone to the socialist block, therefore the trips to West were very restricted. </seg>
<seg id="484"> The Czech tourists went, therefore, of holidays to the beaches of the REV (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A positive exception was the period understood between 1962 and 1972, when could travel to Yugoslavia, nevertheless, later the Yugoslavian state inclined toward the west and the trips of the Czech tourists were then enough restricted. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of the socialism was the fact that to the citizens of the socialist block (that is to say, also to the Checoeslovacos) be not to permitted them to travel free and individually not even by the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual trip was not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The travel agencies offered in those times also travel to the West, but one should be put to the queue with a bag to sleep and to pass thus all the night, or to have &quot;good acquaintances&quot; in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Even so not all was earned. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The call &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for the trips to the West, itself was not granted to the &quot;reliable politically little people&quot;, that thus could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The czechoslovakian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, unsecured of change, was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The great majority of the Czechs they passed their holidays in their own country, for which there was a great number of cabins and summer homes, that the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The way to travel from the Czechs has suffered since 1989 an authentic revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989 for us was the does not go more to spend the holiday in the REV or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs did 4.5 million trips of holidays to countries of the entire world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> It results nna great paradox, of the one that nowadays no longer we are conscious, the fact that to the at present favorite destiny, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel itself freely, because formed part of the Yugoslavia of then. </seg>
<seg id="496"> At the beginning of the years 90 the exemption of visas was imposed to travel to the neighboring States of Europe western, what caused an enormous wave of visits of short term, above all to Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The checoeslovacos, for a long time, himself not enough of the excursions to the West were seen, everyone he wanted to see the him less for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs in the parks in tents slept, since our incomes of then us did not permit to pay a hotel or pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was it to be carried with himself the food (preserves, stuffed, etc.) to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, thus our tourists were able finally, after decades, to buy freely western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living enlarged and with him also the salaries media, what around 1997 caused an increase in the demand of trips. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With the increase of the demand of trips they began the agencies, from 1997 with regularity, to prepare the trips using the connections of charter flights, what caused descended incredibly the prices of the trips in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers. </seg>
<seg id="503"> To ends from the 90 of last century, already the Czechs travelled without visa to almost all the countries developed, except United States, which simplified still more our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of the pursuit-revolutionary tourism happened already in the 2000, when was organized, thanks to an enormous demand, the first flight direct from Chequia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since that year, leave every year direct charter flights with Czech tourists did warm and distant countries. This winter already will fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinies. </seg>
<seg id="506"> The exotic countries visit them at present near 100 thousand Czechs to the year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment of this epoch, that symbolizes our pursuit-revolutionary development, arrived in the year 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17, 2008, United States eliminated the visas for the Czech tourists, with what our country passed to be among the most developed countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, they have passed more than the half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in their history, they have been spent in trips abroad more than 15 thousand Czech crowns by head, including the expenses in the place of stay. </seg>
<seg id="510"> It called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, that would be able to have just new in break-even point. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Since almost five months ago the Czech soccer is without president and is probable that the successor of Ivan Hasšek as the President of the Czech Confederacy of Soccer will not be known neither after the assembly of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> In fact, not yet has arrived at an agreement on the rules of voting to continue. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without the same, itself it will not be able to vote even to elect among the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Them they interested to preside the Czech soccer they are Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> It hasšek renounced its charge in June not without before call its colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person that knew to be in charge of the soccer in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Nevertheless, after concluding was Has itšek, a controversy between the two confederacies of the incapable association was untied of arriving at an agreement to choose a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> It remained in evidence September 16 when had to be chosen the new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní situated in the neighborhood praguense of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not alone as for the method of election. </seg>
<seg id="519"> Itself arrived at no consensus neither as for who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> From that moment and due to this only point, a partial agreement was produced, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Right, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Nevertheless, the disputes on the electoral code continue open. </seg>
<seg id="522"> More light on the situation no longer could throw neither the executive board that, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not resolve anything. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The opinion on the possibility to vote has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point continues being the same one. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is the following one: Of what way to proceed in the third round to avoid the break-even point? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute revolves around if should proceed according to the statutes or to find another model&quot;, says Dušthey go Svoboda, one of the three vice president of the one that, since the direction of the association, represents the professional soccer. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win that candidate that have greater percentage of support in the confederacy to which will present its candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The Region of Moravia is willing to arrive at a commitment so that can win that candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both confederacies. </seg>
<seg id="528"> Bohemia splits it, nevertheless, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should to have the majority of at least two thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;This would remove him, nevertheless, the sense at two o&apos;clock you patrol previous and would deny completely the concept of bicameral system&quot;, thus is like Svoboda understands the objections of it splits morava, according to which the best would be not to touch the order and to vote according to the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With it they said, surprisingly, agrees also Takesš Paclík, although is supposed that the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all the candidates agrees more to Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I would like that voted to the maximum according to the statutes&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So that himself they be not invented any foolishness about the representatives as in the last General Assembly&quot;, the owner of Victory says Plzen, that is advanced for the first time like the candidate and that he directs his observations chiefly against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta continues being an optimist. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him, in Nymburk will be decided on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future cooperated in a constructive way. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passions will be appeased with the party of today of our national team in the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;The soccer will be again protagonist, and thus he cooperated more to flavor&quot; he affirms the representative of the Jablonice, that of the three candidates has more experience in management of the soccer, so much to professional as regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is the most reluctant one. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I expect that arrive at an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is a lot more complicated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;Does not it be a matter of the conflict between bohemians and moravos, but there are intents to adjust the rules to its own convenience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This can have as consequence a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;At any rate, I expect that the common sense will be imposed&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> No longer remains a lot of time so that all the parts arrive at an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations had to be carried out in Montenegro, but ¿who can know until he harms the party if the team of soccer will be complete? </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special airplane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice president Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, not this morning by technical problems in Prague has left, having that to be sought an alternative to transport to part of the executive board to the place where will take place the party of classification. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Quizas the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place to ministerial level, that, they as count, this Wednesday will be celebrated. </seg>
<seg id="546"> To Josef Dobeš, minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like a lot to incorporate to the parts divided to the most powerful sports organization of the country so that arrive at an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot in play: the state subsidies, the credibility of the soccer and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the czechoslovakian confederacy of the sport that will try to endow of a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of lotteries Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík will fight for reaching the presidency, because does not find a more adequate candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the leader of the footballers of Beer, Takesš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly to know the name of an adequate candidate that satisficiese all its ideas on the new president of the Czech Confederacy of Soccer neither would be presented like the candidate to a so prominent position. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there it was an adequate person, would be fighting for her and me would not present as the candidate to the elections.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But to the day of today himself not a person has been able to be found thus&quot;, he said Paclík for the Agency of Czech News </seg>
<seg id="552"> What motivates to Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility to block to Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, that opens the road to the presidency of the Czech Confederacy of Soccer. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also states that, in case to conquer, would remain in the charge of alone president until 2013, when the shift of the ordinary general assembly would arrive. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In that charge he would like to see an expert and good manager that be not too much related to the soccer events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;Already I have spoken with some people to the ones that would be able to keep in mind&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For it was an insanity to hear to some to say that at this time not even they desire to be identified with the Czech soccer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change that vision&quot;, adds. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What supposedly more I bother to Paclík at this time is the relation of Pelta with the President of the Association of Regional Soccer of Beer Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, acquaintance out of the world as a powerful one lobista with capacity to influence in the voting of the delegates in the general assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík is so unacceptable to see Pelta seated in the presidential chair. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;In the event that win, the status would be maintained in force and nothing in the soccer will change&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, the soccer will remove still less benefit&quot;, said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> It mentions also the fact that some years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a listens telephone during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta left unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;Do not I know what prestige to the soccer would be able to bring the victory of Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And with what eyes the UEFA will look at us and the FIFA&quot;, said Paclík, that also takes with certain precaution its previous statement that &quot;would sell the Club Beer if Pelta become president&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case to win the elections on Thursday, Paclík would be able to be presented the cooperation with Pelta in the future. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Of same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, that has been supported for Paclík before the General Assembly of September that finished in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first one to which he would continue&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;Is very capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;Would be able it me to imagine, for example, like the leader of the representation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But not as the manager of an association&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I do neither put the noses there where me do not I feel capable&quot;, added Paclík, that in September stirred up a lot of attention by supporting the suspension of the Commission of Referees presided by Ludek Macel, substituted later by Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík admits that would dare to negotiate the association. </seg>
<seg id="573"> It resorts to his capacities of management of the private enterprises, therefore since last summer is also the Director of the Beer, that with his support he celebrated in May the triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have force to change some things in the environment of soccer and to contribute to its sure practice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, that probably tend to influence in the decisions of the disciplinary committee and of appeal, producing unpleasant situations, he said Paclík without hide his dislikes toward the president of the Sparta Daniel. </seg>
<seg id="576"> One of the priorities would also be that of consolidating the relation between the and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the aid of which exercised pressure on the political leaders so that they destine more money to the sport of the taxes of the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If they enlarged the taxes on the games of chance, as the political parties announce it, would support its arguments, but, frankly, they have that to tell us where is going to stop all this money&quot;, indicates. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Ademas, Paclík now does not keep in mind even its association with the Club Pilsner, although he himself affirms that the President of it should be &quot;not partisan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is at the same time associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;Is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But I do not see sense to the fact to yield hipócritamente my actions of the Club of Beer to another person in order then to return there after a year and a half&quot;, he said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised to the new statutes that to would put an end to the break-even point of the elections. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Soccer one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in case of to be elected, would guarantee that had it some new statutes that to serve finally to solve, in the future, the controversies as for the electoral regulation. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The representative of the Jablonec is an optimist as for the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and he believes that the pre-election conflict would be able to advance toward a solution today with the possible victory of the team of soccer. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Already before the elections done not carry out in September, Pelta promised to be centered, in case of to be elected, exactly in the representation and in collecting funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> It decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, for which this postponement of two months would be able him to go well to defend and to present, in a more extensive context, its ideas on the management of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people of all the levels is in charge of the soccer already a long time ago and wait to know this Thursday to the new President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that the hour has arrived that someone negotiate the association&quot;, he thinks the man that associates chiefly with the Club of Jablonice, but that worked in the Sparta and in the executive board of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="590"> For that reason, he believes to have sufficient experience to negotiate the Czech soccer. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the elation that reigned in the epoch of Ivan Hasšek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Sadly, in the general Assembly of June they were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as all they thought.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already from September&quot;, notified Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Exactly the retraining of the most important document of the Civic Association was used like decoy to be won the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If they choose me president, I will take it me as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in the event that this fail.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist&quot;, he says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Besides, in theory, he tries not to become with his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Already in the past had notified that was seen collaborating with Henry Rajchl, to which respects for his formation in Right, being conscious that his opponent would be besides its first vice president. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Already it carried a lot of time without attacking to Thomas Paclík who, contrary to Pelta, did not leave puppet with head. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;It carries more than one year in the world of soccer, and already has achieved some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Its attacks but were shameful and many people remained surprised by the electoral campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;Therefore many of them doubt on its true character&quot;, its opposing one told Pelta, that continues being faithful to the statements announced already in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Its more powerful weapon is, according to him, its knowledge of the soccer, since the lowest competitions to the superiors. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This last one should be shop window of promotion of the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Likewise, he would try to solve all the scandals that arose on account of the Bohemians as a result of the last year corruption scandal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately later it would involve me in the negotiations with the public sector and the private one, to assure that there be sufficient money for all the soccer&quot;, the the candidate of 46 years said two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Subsequently also it promised that his appointment as the president of the soccer would not behave any personal modification of the staff. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;It would have that to know first the tasks of each employee&quot;, said being referred to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable agitation reigns. </seg>
<seg id="609"> In spite of the current disastrous settings that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, without doubt we will manage to surpass it. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;The soccer needs credibility, which will recover alone if at last has a leader&quot;, still two days before the most decisive day in its career of representative, Pelta continues being an optimist. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises, that under its leadership, would begin it to work with desires. </seg>
<seg id="613"> If in the quarter General Assembly leaves chosen the current vice president Jindrich Rajchl as new president of the Association of many, Czech Soccer people would be shown surely resentful. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that, in case of to be elected, would work itself hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It wants to implement a systematic change and to do that the members of the executive board be responsible for each area of the soccer individually. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Also it compromises to resolve the case of the Bohemians, to improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA, to obtain more money for the soccer and to continue with the work initiated by the previous president Ivan Hasšek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As the president, i would like to dedicate me completely to the soccer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;Since the international contacts with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection, passing for the professional soccer or the training of young footballers of highly performance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;With this do not I mean that would do it all alone&quot;, said Rajchl in an interview for the. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a player of team and I want to divide the competences of the executive board in such a way that each member can be dedicated to an area specifies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will assign difficult tasks so that the soccer be able, in each one of those segments, to continue ahead with a lot of impulse&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;To many people this probably he will not like, because will signify to begin to work very hard and not only to criticize the work of the others&quot;, added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the soccer movement, he is said that he has considered the possibility of be not presented again as the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;All they know, that I work 20 daily hours.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will not be people behind my that will impede me and will hinder at every step&quot;, explained thus the motives of its indecision. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people has said me that I should not give up, because then they would give up also the others&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is a matter of having faith for abandon not thus, without more&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> They as say, motivates him also to continue the work that already began with Hasšek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;During those two years, a great part of the work was finished that do not want that now be lost&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Processes exist that had begun and that will have its effect inside a pair of years and i would not like that someone stop them&quot;, he announced worried by the circumstance of that, if to choose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again just as was before the epoch of Hasšek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in the order, and is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not capable of maintaining. </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him is above all all that people that would be in charge of the soccer so that was alone a privilege for a few chosen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;It can be reproached me a pile of things, but not the fact that I am in favor of someone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I try to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want to do a soccer for all, because alone thus they will feel well all and not alone the chosen&quot;, he said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> It rejects also the idea that alone serious bohemian the president. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Although some people try to affirm the contrary thing, I have in mind to do it maximum by Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, is hour to think about the fact to divide the second division in a Czech part and in another morava, whose winners would go to the first division&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Not the current situation would be given in which we have alone three teams of Moravia, what represents a problem for the players moravos young&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Although to the fight of the presidential elections added Takesš Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl not to stops believing in its possibilities of to be elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;Still I feel to have a strong support of the Czech Confederacy, which chose me as their vice president and that knows that behind me there are clear successes&quot;, said Rajchl, whose successes understand the savings of some scores of millions of crowns of unfavorable contracts, the negotiations of television contracts and the negotiations on the law of the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand, recognizes its part of fault in which the confederacy be not united. </seg>
<seg id="643"> And while it proclaims that Pelta is &quot;disqualified to recover the confidence in the Czech soccer&quot;, considers to the other rival one, Paclík, as a strong candidate that yes has something that to offer to the soccer. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;Nobody can deny that did a great work by the Beer that year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;In the case that be chosen, probably will continue what already began Ivan Hasšek and not foreign exchange in a significant way the staff of the personnel in the committees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;Do not I want to use that to my favor&quot;, evaluates thus to its rival Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="647"> The prettiest pools of Europe </seg>
<seg id="648"> Leap to the blue one </seg>
<seg id="649"> by Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Pools since a viewpoint incredible, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Who visit Europe can live its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, to rest its tired legs in bubbly baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where is found the best welfare in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder carried out a trip of investigation during last year and a half, there was something that could not lack in its luggage, a bather. </seg>
<seg id="653"> It fallen of backs on the water, looked at the artistic dome in the high thing, swam toward the angelotes of marble, that expected it in the edge of the pool and was amazed before the modernist indoor swimming pool restored meticulously. </seg>
<seg id="654"> It liked the bath, took note in its notebook to the moment of all the interesting details on the style and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The historiadora architectural Meder explored more than 200 pools in this manner and presents them in its recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot; : the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bath in the Black Forest, the &quot;constructions of concrete&quot; in Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> It carried out its &quot;trip through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe&quot; for 13 countries: Besides Germany, Austria and Swiss, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> This German of 46 years is a true enthusiast of the culture of the bath. </seg>
<seg id="658"> It wants to have nothing to do with the sport, says Meder, alone the water is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Alone I bother that the fans to the bath have that to be comply with blue tiles and stench to chlorine, while the fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of the forests of firs or to listen the happy trills of the birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;A day I asked me why the pools have to be always so ugly&quot;, affirms this inhabitant of Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I began to collect pretty pools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of the water duplicates the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="663"> The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of welfare in the pools is so large because all the are attended senses, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builder endeavors, the indoor swimming pools can be a true gift for the view: &quot;Instead of floor, in the baths has a surface of water.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;By a part is transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of all the building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All doubles optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colors, the springboards. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The book with photographs in small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and the art history in the historic oasis of the welfare, but, chiefly, gives desires to jump to the blue one. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Meder, the collector of pools discovers the noticeable copies in his investigations in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Next to the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath of Széchenyi of Budapest, of 100 years, the water with nitrates in a singular cavity are found kárstica (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some termas, whose pools are of alkaline water and they are found in a building with form of bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> Many discovered pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city puts the eyes in the pool roofed of Zurich, can look at to Arlberb, covered with snow, since the exterior pool of a bath in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window since the one that the practice in the trails can be observed of ski. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The design, perhaps, more extraordinary wait to the clients in Längenfeld: The cathedral of the water of Ötztal seems a UFO that has just landed in the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Of three open sources vapor in winter rises, while of fund the mountains of Ötztal are raised in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> To Meder, the collector of pools, him did not invade the smell to chlorine in all the pools. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague to diesel oil is so strong that the people believes to have arrived at a sanitary bath. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the medicinal water that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose mud is hit to the skin upon entering the pool, an enjoyment of the in a way special welfare. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Iris Meder also was disappointed in a place in its search of pretty places for the bath, when wanted to visit discovered pools and baths of sun in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, was found with a land blocked. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bath from 1902 of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When Meder looked at through them decayed windows of the yellow white, red, and modernist building, saw the weeds to grow among the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> The decadence counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald. </seg>
<seg id="681"> These baths have three phases of construction after of itself; not alone can be discovered elements neorománicos of times of their construction in 1844, if not also an Arabian foyer of style Alhambra, added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the collector of pools, Iris Meder, and not alone because be natural of the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It has a lot of merit to fuse different architectural styles in a so fantastic unit&quot;, affirms Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In a palace thus the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have a lot of importance. </seg>

<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the markets of global commodities cause rise the prices, and the banks charge with the responsibility of the world problem of the hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the defender of the consumer is directed in concrete to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although the large banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act of way seemed. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally, the bets on commodities thought to protect the merchants of the oscillations of the prices. </seg>
<seg id="699"> The main experts agree that the players have been disconnected of the supply and demand, and remove profits of the prices of the poorest. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann reacted before the criticisms of different form that the American competitors: It promised to revise the demands and said that no business &quot;deserves to compromise the good fame of the Deutsche Bank&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working party is revising the demands of the report of Foodwatch. </seg>

<seg id="703"> To ends of January, the direction of the bank will report of the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> In the end would be able to be given a reduction of the business of the commodities, or even its total abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann tries to fix its image. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed its criticisms to the financial sector: &quot;The bets to growing prices of food show of especially drastic way how the merciless banks damage at present the public welfare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann he is found like the major banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;The Deutsche Bank should annul all the investments of its accounts receivable in which put in play the money for bets of eating prices&quot;, affirmed Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It gives equal if Ackermann treats the theme of the people that passes hunger or the fame of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The inspection of Ackermann turns out to be surprising at first sight, but is of course the leader of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his position. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the president of the board of directors will change somewhat different to him done not plan in the board meeting. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation can perfect its image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And it needs that barely possible losses they import him, of that its successor will be occupied. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Two thirds would annul the investment in commodities </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch endeavors in maintaining high the pressure on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> Up to now, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Tuesday, Bode published the survey for the one that the Institute Forsa had asked 1,001 people the 7 and 8 of November. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Barely the 10 percent considered legitimate that the Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which the prices of the food were wagered. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences upon discovering that its bank participated in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would annul all the investments of the ones that money of the agrarian speculation leaves. </seg>
<seg id="720"> The 43 percent would dissuade a bank thus to its acquaintances, the 49 percent would request, after reflecting, to annul its account and would change to another institute. </seg>
<seg id="721"> The house 21 in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The building transferred </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy end, the building of the Austrian World&apos;s Fair of Brussels of 1958 obtained prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and decayed. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now reopens as house of expositions. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The architecture of postgerra modern impassions, the clear forms, the halls of crystal, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of the thought on the technical progress, for what, the Austrian building of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the World&apos;s Fair of Brussels of 1958 is a known and adequate example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Building of Schwanzer obtained then the Grand Prix of Architecture by its light and floating construction of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is considered to the present time a contemporary milestone of the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> It did the so known architect that also built the building of Austria in the following World&apos;s Fair. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With its legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW more the adjacent building leveled in Munich, passed to internationally to be known. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its building, designed as a temporary construction for expositions raised itself after the World&apos;s Fair in the Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the century was inaugurated 20, was called the &quot;house 20&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building was adapted but lacked the spaces and adequate technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, neither a good environment. </seg>
<seg id="733"> In spite of it was utilized until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The building is empty since 2001 and each time decays more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> At present, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the building, now calls it &quot;house 21&quot; and will be used in the future as museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday afternoon the museum gazebo was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exposition, a stroke of luck in a way. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes Husslein-Arch, the new director of the gallery Austrian gazebo since 2007, achieved a new beginning. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-arch, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among others things, patinadora artistic on ice in its youth, later in Sotheby, the museum Guggenheim and director founder of the museum of modern art of Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor are exposed Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation, there should be a café and a bookstore and besides to be built a building of offices. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict control, low budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was the best election to do it. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not alone because reformed in a sensitive way the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and him was judged the contest, if not because studied with Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the building was for him an &quot;important and immense place&quot;, in which contemplated &quot;almost all weekends&quot; the expositions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the project and the problem of the building, that disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of utilization with generosity and facility. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reforms there are large problems, the building was &quot;a devouring one of energy&quot;, said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> It changed the profile of the windows of the facade of crystal, an insulating crystal was installed reinforced with fiberglass and the ceiling of crystal by a special safety glass was replaced. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The thermal bridges and the beams of steel were reinforced or they replaced and the ceilings of asbestos they were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements were employed for the new use, a board of light descended among the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter to the almost new building, but still the building of Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old tones mahogany and protected against the oxidation. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the movie theater is exactly as was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a reduction budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often it had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked to the monuments protection office&quot;, affirms Krischanitz and notifies of a rough floor in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> In spite of all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building is maintained flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> That business about the building &quot;that came of Brussels&quot; has been difficult, affirmed does little Krischanitz, a typical one &quot;coincidental apparition in the history of the city&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> An architecture thus is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and therefore wanted &quot;to awake the adequate conscience&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has happened an urban development stroke of luck. The completely new one and planned &quot;neighborhood of the central station&quot;, with dwellings and offices, is found next to the Schweizer Garten. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And perhaps happen another stroke of luck: The house 21 would be able to receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, therefore the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary art of berlin and, as is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten. </seg>

<seg id="814"> Its Berkshire Hathaway possesses near approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of all a series of large consortiums as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, old Münchener Rück. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Buffett, of 81 years, took charge of the small business textile Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and, with wise investments, expanded it to becoming one of the most valuable businesses of the world. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Nevertheless, its way of life is humble. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Therefore is an idol for innumerable investors of the entire world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Its express train and infallible felt to win money has supplied him the nickname of &quot;oracle of Omaha&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After discovering the investment of Buffett, the actions of IBM in market rose one percent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;The blue giant&quot;, like he is known to IBM, he has a value in market of more than 220 thousand million dollars and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable businesses of technology of the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> With Microsoft, affirmed Buffett, does not want to collaborate. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat itself concrete </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of &quot;the cell of Zwickau&quot;, the Turkish mass media doubt of the German democracy. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper speech of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that be revived again. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right. </seg>
<seg id="827"> In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and worry before this news. </seg>
<seg id="828"> For many Germans of Turkish origin a ghost returns that dead was believed time ago, since the attacks with form of fires in Mölln in November of 1992 and in Solingen in May of 1993, not episodes of violence with background of far right against Turks had occurred more. </seg>
<seg id="829"> Nevertheless, never it has been questioned that in Germany exist xenofobia. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The network discovered extreme right-winger reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, neither much less, foreseeable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;¿Be revived again the bloody ideology?&quot;, regular the edition by internet of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; stands out on the contrary that one of the authors of the crime was an informing one of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is shown worried about that the German authorities can be implied in the marshland extreme right-winger. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The Turkish community in Germany reacted with sensibleness, the weekend recalled the victims of the racist violence with a wakefulness before the Door of Brandenburgo. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin along with the German politicians and Turks reflected in a solemn act of the fifty anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement. </seg>
<seg id="835"> The contact was put in scene with happy colors, like a history with happy end. </seg>
<seg id="836"> The information arrived at some Turkish media as a slap: &quot;The German gift by the fifty anniversary&quot;, the title of an article in the Turkish platform of internet says &quot;there to Be X&quot;, being referred to the background of the chain of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> The German emission &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does neither insist on drawing this mental connection. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It begins to smell badly&quot;, the title of the column says of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It stands out that them murdered were people that paid their taxes and they did an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> In the forums of internet of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically. </seg>
<seg id="841"> The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not sought long before suspects in the circle of the far right. </seg>
<seg id="842"> Some it is shown as much as less rhetorical as for the drastic media: &quot;From now on here is lost, to the immigrants does not remain them more than the self-defense and the armament&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;This will be the best autoprotección&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;The internal peace of Germany depends hardly of the quality of the explanation and of the adaptation of the sanction to all the network&quot;., writes &quot;Selen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What signifies that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen they will be clarified in ninety years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been engraved in the Turkish and German memories. </seg>
<seg id="847"> No another event showed more clearly the Turks that live here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that the distrust and the distance can flow into in the violence. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks intensify the feeling of group of the Turkish part. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Repeat not the errors of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press the deficiency of the German politics after the attacks was criticized then chiefly, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the attack with form of fire of Solingen sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, its minister of Exterior Matters, substituted it in the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in their speech what contribute with the taxes the Turks of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="852"> It remains clearly how the value of a person according to the amount of its taxes is calculated. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current information of the Turkish media shows again the deep thing that is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Besides the effort of an extensive explanation and of a revaloración of the terrorism of far right in Germany, this time they cause lacks clear words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank of the scandal of the lake of Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most it risked bank of Europe is not found in Italy neither France, if not in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS almost entered bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then slid of a crisis to the following one. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now a German directs it. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Sure that Axel Weber had not thought it. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure of the summit of the federal bank, in July he was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new one and almost likewise of spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber is happy publicly, praises Switzerland by its beauty and to the UBS by its recently acquired solidity and drops kind observations on its future companions. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The USB has achieved a revitalization&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;It is happy me to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> In September remained of course all would be completely different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A financial user of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and he defrauded 1.7 billion euro. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Oswald Grübel, general director of the USB, a banker not alone acquaintance in Switzerland, had to respond. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The president of the administrative council of the USB was considered since then likewise touched, and all they asked: When arrives Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> He was known that Weber should assess to the bank from February of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And it will take charge of the presidency of the administrative council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, like the bank communicated Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> This is hard for Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Is not a banker, more well, professor of economy and counselor and he has had a period of surely necessary adaptation. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Of blow holds responsible itself of the strategy of a bank, that has just tested again that deserves the title &quot;the major bank of the scandal of Europe&quot; since time ago. </seg>
<seg id="873"> On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until does little was the major administrator of world goods, and on the other hand, since years ago, he slides of a scandal to the following one. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, thus seems it, him is saved to the long ago so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Began the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The USB had an excellent fame until 2007. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the administrator of discreet Swiss goods and solid, but also handy, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a great number in the investment banks. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB negotiates more money of wealthy clients that any another bank of the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, advanced as investment bank in the league of the large banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This impresses. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Hans Geiger, the old banker and subsequent professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: &quot;Before my students, always I have qualified to the USB as model of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;Since the current point of view, one is asked: How would it be able to mistake me?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> Was in a great error. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In the year 2007 left to the light that something left very badly in the USB. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of year, Peter Wuffli, general director, that up till then was considered as a very intelligent and genial banker, resigned surprisingly. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months later, the reason he suspected himself. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment fund of the bank embarked upon losses with high-risk titles and had to pay off thousands of millions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To charge with this, the USB announced an injection of capital you&apos;re welcome less than of 13 billion Franks. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this he found investors, naturally that some they looked at with contempt to a short time before: an Asian state fund and opaque of Singapore and a so discreet, Arabian state fund, that never its name had heard itself. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This was alone the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April of 2008, got worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second better paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October of 2008, continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many thousands of millions, the Swiss Confederation gave six thousands of millions of Franks by an obligatorily convertible bond, by means of the one that became joint-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Every Switzerland was affected, the dramatic thing was affirmed that was this for a small country, if lodges to so large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally the sum of the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more than five greater times that the economic results of Switzerland (to see graphic). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We cannot rescue again to the UBS&quot;, Geiger, expert in banking said. </seg>
<seg id="898"> To the first catastrophe united the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Few months later, the UBS surrendered in a fiscal conflict with America and was shown willing to deliver the data of the wealthy clients, that possibly had defrauded taxes with aid of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Besides, it approves a figure of 780 thousands of million dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted benefits of these business with a compensation by payment. </seg>
<seg id="901"> With it, the UBS confessed more or less to have helped in the tax dodge. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Simultaneously it lost something that had been always its capital in the competence by rich clients: the halo of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank no longer is the same one. </seg>
<seg id="904"> To this continued the resignation of the president of the board of directors and of the president of the administrative council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of the funds of the clients. </seg>
<seg id="906"> In this manner, in few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the banking of investments by means of the erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods by means of the aid to the tax dodge. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when it was again something more tranquil, just when thought that the UBS to obtain it again, happens this unhappy history of the user, an individual user defrauded 1.7 billion euro, before the bank realized that something went badly. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it was watchful, by it seen, this does not yet function well with the management of risk in the banking of investments. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli is declared that the controls of risk have changed too little&quot;, affirms Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finances in the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a great German bank also is sure: &quot;The problem of the UBS is that does not dominate the controls of risk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="911"> For which the idea of the precaution arose, with the one that the Swiss bankers were presented since time ago, to be the guardians of the greater goods of the world: no too large risk, on the other hand, the security of the money wants to break on the other side of the alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The deposits of security of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unbreakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The head office of the UBS in Zurich does not insert with the cliché of the solid alone, Swiss private bank is a little greater. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its main headquarters on the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, that goes since the main station directly to the lake of Zurich, framed by the summits covered with snow of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Here jewelry stores are found like Tiffany`s among Swiss traditional business as the sweetshop Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Here they reside since years ago the Swiss banks: since the national bank, passing for the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Enters the room of reception of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are covered with marble, before large chairs of leather are found, next to the logo of the bank there is a great sign to indicate the &quot;security&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the client seeks here: Security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, in some moment they have displaced the idea of the great Swiss bank, or they have betraied it, like the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks. </seg>
<seg id="923"> It prefers not to read its name in the newspaper, when all is said and done does, as all the Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has done itself too large, thinks, chiefly in the banking of investments, where the Anglo-saxon have earned earthly. </seg>
<seg id="925"> There the Swiss did not have nothing but to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And they have accustomed for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-saxon.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact, the UBS changed the banking of Anglo-saxon investments, delivered its first one great profit and then came the disaster, any European financial company had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the great Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;That Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of its nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in its book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish). </seg>
<seg id="930"> The politicians granted until 68 thousands of millions of Franks or approximately 45 thousands of millions of euro to save to the great bank of the bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How occurs them itself? </seg>
<seg id="932"> It is spoken with the Swiss bankers, thus they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June of 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks fuse in a powerful consortium. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank arises that, due to the fusion, was too large for the small one Switzerland, and continues growing. </seg>
<seg id="935"> For which it served so that the two different banks precursors of the UBS were complemented: a rich but asleep bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and an internacionalización poorer but stronger. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the investment banks internationalized arrived from opportune way with a lot of money, with the one that could cause to roll a great financial bicycle. </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are two names related to this ascent of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, leader of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;Always I thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team&quot;, the expert in banking says Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that understands a lot of models and statistical, and Ospel, the intuitive one that step since the learning in the bank to the summit managed to open.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> Finally, Ospel trust Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And in the end Wuffli committed probably a decisive error: &quot;It thought that its models were a reality&quot;, Geiger says. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;Is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Is clear: The blunder arrived before the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The employees of the UBS agree clearly of the meetings of executives, in which Wuffli, the leader of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Descending of the throne to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> They headed the &quot;League Tables&quot;, the classifications that then documented the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> The UBS wanted to be in the summit. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps you left him well. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the operations of currencies and in the negotiation of actions was in the higher. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Nevertheless, the management consultants in charge put of relief a weak point: In the business of the international interest, in the language of banking &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is an enormous compensation for the large banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS has empty in the American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill these empty, the UBS began an adventure that almost its existence costs him. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Avid of growth, they invested so much the same bank as one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It was transformed into a powerful machine to entitle American mortgage loans and to sell them subsequently, maintaining you determined risks to own account. </seg>
<seg id="956"> And also, like other banks sought the lowering for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;In summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there&quot;, Geiger, expert in banking said. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So large the elation, so deep the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager had to be gone, since the intent to order turned out to be more complicated of what expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The positions in the UBS became seats ejector and they are insecure to the present time. </seg>
<seg id="961"> At present, who directs a great bank, has an almost impossible work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He should find a strategy for a bank, before the one that all the models of logical business be lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, to put an end to the banking of investments, to be concentrate on the administration of goods, to return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The bank does not want to arrive so far away (still). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the banking of investments should diminish a lot, is clear at present. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> In reality, alone thought itself about the Italian-Swiss one of 51 years as a transitory solution, since the bank the bank was separated surprisingly of its ancestor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, he was imposed: It should direct in a permanent way the business of the UBS, communicated the bank of Zurich Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its state in the middle of the ninety. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It suppresses 3,500 positions. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But this does not suffice. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> With what wants to win money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These they are the questions that sure is done Axel Weber at present. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Up to now alone he says that first he will seek a dwelling with his woman in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The following year. </seg>

<seg id="992"> The businesses produced in September the two percent less than the previous month, as reports the office of statistics of Eurostat. </seg>
<seg id="993"> What created skepticism among the American investors: &quot;We are not an island, if not dependent&quot;, said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe cannot free itself so quickly of a recession, besides there are more signs of weakness in the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Warren Buffett, the legend of the investments, alone confirmed this precaution, yet is not clear if Europe is it sufficient strong to do all that is needed for put an end to the crisis, affirmed in an interview for the CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore, since its point of view is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks. </seg>

<seg id="1260"> I have here some counsels of action: Start gently this page and become its mark pages. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> It will come know very well these people in the narration fiction of the Mister Englund, and this dramatis personae will function like its GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, be confused and deserted in the fog of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The Mister Englund is a historian and swedish journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Also it is the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, that grants the Nobel Prize of Literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> What has written here is an unusual book, that describes, wise, as &quot;a work of anti-history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains some notable names, important or famous treaties you battle; practically there are not ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or material. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is not so much a book about what occurred, explains, as &quot;a book about how occurred&quot;. Treats about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; combines the experiences in times of war of more or less 20 men and ordinary women, to both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, conductors of ambulance and administrative. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people they will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some they will become prisoners of war, or they will lose their members, they will go crazy or they will die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Its lives blink here as on votive candles in a church; some new are added to the mixture while other they are put out. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book of the Mister Englund is a deviation of the books of standard history. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Is also a corrective one to the notion that the First alone World War was the ill-fated trench warfare in the western front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; moves from expert form through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the oriental front, Mesopotamia, Africa of the east. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> To the soldiers in this book fall them on top the hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse-tse are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is a moving book, almost since the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that infects to cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you are a woman that is at home with your children, ¿remain or flee? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Of all forms ¿who comes? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly anybody understands what is happening, not even why this war he has to fight himself. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Lack in fact&quot;, observes the Mister Englund, &quot;he has been filled with conjectures, suppositions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of the conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and rumors&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; continues individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the deep-sea fleet. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Its histories have been obtained in their greater part by memory, letters and another material already published previously. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are fuller of life in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, of the Mister Englund. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of these are about hardships and to fix them to him with what there is. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> About counting the history of a German schoolgirl says: &quot;Substitute, all over substitute&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Substitute of coffee, false aluminum, rubber of imitation, bandages of role, buttons of wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> It continues speaking of the substitute food in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> It describes &quot;done meat from rice stew and pressed in grease of ram (and concluded with a bone false fact of wood); done tobacco of roots and peelings of dry potatos; shoes with soles of wood&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There is, observes, &quot;837 replacements permitted of the meat in the production of sausages, 511 replacements of the registered coffee&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some histories are about the honor and the value. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes his own impulse toward the savagery and he declares about the war: &quot;You feel that, after all, this is for what the men are conceived and not to be sat down in chairs with a cigar and a whisky, the newspaper in the afternoon or a best seller, and to intend that that varnish signifies civilization and that there is not a barbarian behind that shirt front starched and studded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> On the other hand a British soldier realizes that probably he will die, and that nobody will be informed or he will import him. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;Once one it is resigned to the thought to be sacrificed, to one he would like to think that would be able to occur in front of the public&quot;, writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> On the other hand, horribly is seemed &quot;to a condemned being strangled in secret&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations are about an old one Europe disappearing, and about of new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict has been converted each time more in an economic competition&quot;, writes the Mister Englund, &quot;a war among factories&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It reflects the arrival of what calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The murderer in eloquent mass and convinced ideologically with clothes of good making that executes his meat market while he is seated behind a desk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> The people behaves in an unexpected way; there is so much ignoble as heroic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The Mister Englund speaks of the soldiers that tried actively to catch a venereal illness of prostitutes as a way of to evade the service in the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the commerce of pus gonocócico, that the soldiers buy and they besmear with it his genitals with the hope to finish in the hospital&quot;, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those that are truly desperate they rub it on its eyes, what often gives rise to a blindness by life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of the Swede done by Peter Serious, the prose of the Mister Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to its human task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small reflected scenes the way in which the war to &quot;untied exceptionally uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The people begins ask why its leaders are causing them fighting. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The better books about the First World War often have been indirect, as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as as usual in the front of Erich María Rebrand, instead of integral histories. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The volume of the Mister Englund joins with a conventional little pantheon. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Its book has one of the most devastating ends than I can recall in a work of not fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> It I will not reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But is as if to have arrived since its book, started from among your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and it to have burned with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a step in false prior, a robbery planned to the minute </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of they carrying riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The night was chosen on Monday to Tuesday because the park Zuccotti would be emptier. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was maintained in secret save for a few officials of highly rank, saying initially to the others that they were being joined with an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The inspector of police Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, its presence underlined how the operation plagued itself of challenges for the department of police. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> They could not be repeated the episodes of recent weeks, like the crushing of espray pepper on the demonstrators, infringing the norms of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy toward the &quot;okupas&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And because of it the police operation to clear the park Zuccotti of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The agents had been prepared seeing as they had developed the occupations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A semblance of greater catastrophe was taking place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking at toward Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The agents increased the disorders training call - measures contraterroristas that implied to mobilize quickly to a great police officials number - to be centered in the Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was on Monday night, in the side of Manhattan of the river East. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to enter the park arrived in the &quot;last minute&quot;, someone he said familiarized with the orders, that they referred to the alone mission as &quot;an exercise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;To the few cops that know that were calls for this, him did not they tell that was to enter the park Zuccotti&quot;, the person said, that he spoke of anonymous form. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only people that knew that were going to enter in the park Zuccotti were in the highest levels of the department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> A reason for the excessive secrecy was a lesson learned by the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they desisted when hundreds of demonstrators arose before time after to have heard about the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation on Tuesday implied agents of several police units, including you force special of all the municipal district - scores of mobile agents that habitually were used to flooding the neighborhoods with highly index of criminality. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The Mister Kelly said that many people, like those that travel daily at work, they had been going and coming from the park during the day, doing from the 1 to.m. a good hour to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriated to do it when was the smaller number of people in the park&quot;, said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with foci and loudspeakers congregated in the crossing of Pike Briefs with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before leaving. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and the messages pregrabados that resounded since the loudspeakers they seemed to intimidate many demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> The agents of common matters went to the park with their windbreak blue space, many demonstrators simply collected their things and they were themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Himself not any store to the 1:45 was touched to.m., the police said, giving time to the demonstrators to collect his belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of agents were seen being met in the perimeter to enter if was needed to do detentions in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The journalists in the park were forced to abandon it. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the Police head of the department spokesman, he said that he was by his security. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists said that he tried to avoid that to see the police to enter action in the park, and that had been treaties unceremoniously by the agents. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> The Mister Browne said that the mobile units of television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> To the extent that the police moved toward the west through the dense tangle of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggages and trash bags of role and of plastic packed of clothes, teams of the Department of Cleaning continued them, collecting what was left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some demonstrators that refused to be moved were dragged was, appearing on the Internet little images time later. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A central group of demonstrators took positions near the zone of kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some they did a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Around some 10 people in the epicenter of the camp they were locked among them by the arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people were chained to trees, the Mister said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The agents of the service of emergencies were calls to cut the padlocks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Himself not arrests in the park were done to more or except the 3:30 to.m., the Mister said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The operation of clearness was complete some 75 minutes later, the police said. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The Mister Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests they were by &quot;alteration of the law and order and resistance to the authority&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The highest-ranking agent in the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the uniformed upper official in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the leader of detectives of the department, also was there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The Mister Kelly, while been present, &quot;was not directing the operations&quot;, the Mister said Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of agents expected along the oriental side of Broadway, among the streets Liberty and Cedar, in the event that they had that to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were raised on the street Cortlandt, a block to the north of the park, and on the street Pine, a block to the south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Since those positions, the police expanding was seen the perimeter even beyond the park Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> In a moment given, a series of agents, many of them with shields, they were seen pushing to the people toward outside. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> There was some 28 people in the north perimeter. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the noisiest action at night took place to the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> In around at 5 o&apos;clock to.m., to the south of the street Pine, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a car of police, and to other he was seen him removing the air of the wheels of a van of police. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> In a moment given, a piece of plywood left flying since the multitude. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The support workers union will demand to the city by the dismissals </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union that represents to hundreds of workers of school support that lost its jobs last month plans to demand to the city Wednesday, alleging that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on the schools that attend poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The demand is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort by revoking the dismissals. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred seventy-two assistants of the school, the coordinators of parents and other employees that were among the worst-paid of the city lost their work October 7, in a movement that the union leaders have described as a political revenge by their refusal to permit, last spring, the access on the part of the city to a fund of health care in charge of working parties To close their budgetary gap. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The municipal authorities have denied categorically that accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> In an audience in the City Hall last month, the counselor of education, Dennis M. Walcott, he said that the dismissals were a part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Counsel counterattacked telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the personnel of support of the school said good-bye. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials of the municipal district 37 said that they presented the claim in writing, notifying to the Department of Education that would be demanded. A press conference Wednesday will be celebrated to announce the official presentation of the demand, in the Supreme State Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The demand will include the Mr. Walcott and to the Department of Education of the city as accused, and counts on eight workers said good-bye like the plaintiffs, all they black or latin American women, just like the majority of the assistants that lost its jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, he said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a rough draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has been centered in the number of dismissals in the schools of poor zones of the city to support a claim by unjust deal, saying that the poor schools lost more assistant, since insufficiently they had been subsidized of chronic form. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> It is indicated that though did not there were dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in the schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 they said good-bye in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Keeping in mind the loss of five of the eight employed assistants by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where the 68 percent of the students they live in the poverty, the demand says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents that can collect funds to cover the budgetary deficit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P D. The budget of the district 36 was reduced in 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the form in which calculates the additional financing for each registration by poor student in the schools. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also affirms that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memo that authorizes the dismissal of the coordinators of parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo utilized the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, in spite of the fact that &quot;surplus&quot; describes with greater frequency the act to transfer to a teacher of the payroll from a school to a market of work, whose salaries are full by the headquarters. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six coordinators of parents said good-bye&quot;, the rough draft of the complaint says, &quot;and not only in surplus&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission finished, the Congress prepared to arrive at an agreement on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Seems that finally republican and democrats in the Capitol are willing to be come to an agreement on something related to the lifting in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Everything that it was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi to be captured and murdered and the participation U.S. arrived at its end. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Tuesday, the Committee of Exterior Matters of the Senate is going to consider a resolution, sponsored by the president John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), along with the senators John McCain (republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans by its successful rebellion and to the troops of United States by its &quot;bravery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honor to the brave of Libya, upon beginning to reconstruct its country&quot;, said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;Is an affirmation of two-party support for its democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language can seem inoffensive, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy up to now. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, the legislators of both parties fought themselves between itself and with the White House on the editing of a series of resolutions to approve or to reject the role of the soldiers of United States in the mission of the NATO in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the military use limited of forces of United States in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The government bill was defeated in the Camera by an extensive two-party margin, and that never came be voted in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But the same day in which the government bill was rejected in the Camera, the camera also rejected a measure that would have trimmed the funds for the American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That left the mission of United States in a species of legislative purgatory - with the Congress it sufficiently I bother as to criticize the management on the part of Obama of the mission, but not so angry like for in reality to reap the herb under its feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Subsequently, the indecision of the Congress was surpassed by the events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered October 20. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The mission of the NATO finished officially October 31. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate would be able to be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee of Exterior Matters &quot;congratulates to the town of Libya by its tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to be freed to itself&quot; and &quot;praises the men and women of the Armed Forces U.S. and to its associates of the coalition that participated in military operations to protect to the town of Libya by its extraordinary bravery and professionalism&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition toward the democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> It will win the new measure the complete support of the commission of Exterior Matters, or will divide the legislators as did the government bill of June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The last version was rejected by the senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main republican of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The spokesman of Place said Monday that had not seen still the final version of the new government bill. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> On the other side of the Capitol, the Camera is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a stable budget, a legislative priority for almost all the republican congresspersons and some democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, sponsored by the republican one Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any another theme that in fact achieve a voting of all the assembly in the Camera or the Senate in this Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators done not be successful up to now to cause to arrive their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of intents. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> That of Goodlatte is alone one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, that they cover an extensive range of themes. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some they are duplicates - the same government bill is proposed so much in the Camera as in the Senate - and other with light variations among itself. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There is at least 15 versions of the amendment of the so alone budgetary equilibrium in the Camera, and another handful that &quot;will control the federal expense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of those government bills also they are identical among itself, but give its sponsors - above all inexperienced republicans that seek to refine their currículums - the opportunity to be boasted that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of measured happiness. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Budget Control Law, that was approved in August, requirió that so much the Camera as the Senate they voted an amendment of the budgetary equilibrium. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a not binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, various members want to limit the number of mandates that the members of the Congress can comply, while the representative José E. Mountain (democratic by New York), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to an education of quality and sanitary attention, among others themes. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment that prohíbe the homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as a that prohíbe burns it of flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators also want to permit the annulment of the federal laws if they are rejected for two thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So enthusiastic that have been the members at the moment of to propose amendments, themselves they are not moving to a faster rhythm than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111º Congress, the legislators proposed 77 modifications, and they presented 66 in the 110º. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The rhythm is unacceptable in comparison with that of the decade of 1990, when the members presented regularly more than 150 amendments every other year, according to well-proportioned figures by the Library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they did not have a lot more success then of what have it now. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment that was added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposal by the Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;It struck but done not defeat,&quot; Giffords speaks in its first interview in TV since the cross-fire </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman shot point blank in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democratic by Arizona) appeared in the national television the night on Monday, he sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway &quot;The sun will leave tomorrow&quot; and said that wanted to be recovered more than what wanted to return to the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In its apparition in ABC News “20/20&quot;, with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed aid for walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The program documented its difficult road of return of the caused damages by a bullet that the skull fractured him and perforated the left side of its brain, and that step since the front to the subsequent part of its head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, returned for surprise to the Camera to emit its triumphant vote in the agreement of the ceiling of debt. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In its first television interview since the cross-fire of January, that killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, itself rio and sang - and described its recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked him how feels, Giffords, of 41 years, responded: &quot;Well enough&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Giffords and its husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of &quot;20/20&quot; of an hour of duration, that the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple was emitted,&quot; Gabby: A history of courage and hope&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the cross-fire of January 8. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In engraved videos by Kelly in the first weeks, it he is seen in his bed of hospital, with the shaved head and a long scar crossing his front. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She only can maintain one or two fingers straightened up, while its husband encourages it. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, he is seen Giffords seated in a wheelchair while the therapists teach him how to carry out simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A movement of head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A gather of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, its first word: &quot;What&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In few days, Giffords pronounced another word - &quot;toast&quot;, a request of change in its menu of breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos diffused by ABC show that the music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congressperson singing along with the therapists is seen the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; of Cyndi Lauper and &quot;Free Falling&quot; of Tom Petty. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours ago of therapy every day, he said that he does not recall the day of the cross-fire. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Its husband said that he was reading him to Giffords an article of the newspaper on the murder of March 12 when she stopped it to ask for the first time about the six that had died in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The suspicious gunman, Jared Reads Loughner, person under arrest in a prison is found of Missouri and is being medicated for the force while expects judgment. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people died&quot;, told Giffords to Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told her Sawyer that in a moment of the recovery of her wife, she said: &quot;I have been defeated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So, I told him,&quot; &apos;Gabby, you have not been defeated,&apos;&quot; he said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> &quot;So alone you have been struck. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you are going to leave this, and are going to recover you and are going to return with more forces that never.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> The troops cause they feel more pity than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a gala of Wall Street that collected million dollars for the veterans without home in New York. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad on the impotence, the frustration and the loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Just then, various hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines burst in their positions around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The multitude of label stood up and they applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women were you considered as the heroes&quot;, David said Saltzman, who organized the spring funds collection. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A military official of highly rank in the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Greater State, the admiral Mike Loosen, saw the role of the troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They showed him as an orphan boy species&quot;, he wrote the official in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Themselves that had them. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But was not respect, truly. Was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relation that itself there is attorney of the soldiers and an often distant American public, at times, worshiper. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Lavishes to the troops with compliments by its sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has a price, the members of the service say. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public each time more acts as if they gave suffers him those uniformed. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not victims at all&quot;, the general of brigade said they Be B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon will leave toward Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way that some they show its support is to put us us in the role of souls deserted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The theme is a very sensitive theme for the military leaders, that do not want to seem unappreciative or in disagreement with the public to which they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also they realize that the ira to which the troops were faced that returned in recent years of the Vietnam War was a lot worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a consequence, the majority of the conversations on the pity they are carry out in silence and in private among the veterans of war. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After its two children returned from to fight with the marines, the colonel withdrawn Mark Cancian notified them that the people aside from the soldiers would consider its service since two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some they would look at with a feeling of fear due to that were faced the rebels and they travelled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Other they would be asked if there would be a &quot;veteran angry and violent under the surface&quot;, he said Cancian, that he fought in Iraq and he returned to a work of highly level of the government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During its search of employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly if would be capable of enduring under the pressure of an exacting work of Washington immediately after its tour of battle. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you speak about your service, need to face the negative impressions&quot;, recalled Cancian counting it to him its children. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military anxiety arises, in part, of the American indifference toward the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The achievements in the country of battle are rare chosen time for the praise on the part of a country that has little familiarity with the soldiers and he sees few direct benefits of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We, like nation, no longer we value the military heroism so that they were of the all common in World War Two&quot;, the lieutenant general withdrawn said David Barno, who he commanded the troops of United States in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> On the other hand, the compliments of the politicians and of the public are centered in great measure in the depth of the suffering of a member of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized for the number of tours that have borne, the number of friends that have lost or the reach of their wounds. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army confronts a growing pressure to put an end to the violation </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a historic audience will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army by their supposed passiveness before the violation. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the following one. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier of first Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks of embarrassment the night in which she says that he was violated by a companion. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was October of 2008, and was directed of return to its headquarters in the Air Base Miramar, to the north of San Diego, after the supper with a friend when was found with a colleague that carried a package of 12 tin platings of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked him if he could be joined with her in his room to take a cup. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;It sounded a warning sign&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> Nevertheless, the native of Texas left to one side his worry. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought, not, has 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is of Texas&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I hope to have listened to my instincts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> To the few minutes to enter the room of Lyman, the man approached him himself from behind, throwing it downward and violating it, he alleges. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, November 18, Lyman and other 27 members of the current military personnel and old they expect anxiously a judicial decision in a historic judgment that will be celebrated in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide if the demand that have interposed against the exsecretario of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to judgment. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The demand alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the violation generalized among the soldiers, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> It presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, D.C., the demand implied initially 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all they affirm that were violets or attacked sexually by its companions, and that the army failed at the moment of to investigate, to process, or to give adequate justice after the supposed aggressions. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says that goes to by the greater page of the army, because the problem begins with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is an upper structure downward&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;¿Who are the people that are in conditions to eradicate the culture of the retaliations? The high command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also he says that from February, they have itself placed in contact with her near 400 survivors more, many of which could be part of future you demand. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Its strategy: Instead of accumulating to all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in a same basket, by thus tell it, is going to present various cases, of being necessary, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of the defense for the Department of Defense, headline by the federal public prosecutor Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to reject the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The documents of the court, obtained by Newsweek, they detail the strategy of defense -in essence, that the soldiers cannot be demanded for current or old soldiers by the wounds suffered in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> By a sentence of the Supreme Court of 1950 call the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not a head by the damages suffered by the personnel in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The damages alleged are part of the active duty of the plaintiffs&quot;, the documents say. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> The things have changed since the years 50. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While to the women still is them officially prohibited to serve in battle, this distinction is only nominal: The wars modern rare time have clear the lines of the front. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> So much in Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldier are playing role increasingly more important, especially to arrive at the local women in war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of battle. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is hour that the army also be modernized, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in their fight, and other three demands are in motion, besides theirs. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> In the Faculty of Right of Yale, the Clinic of Legal Services for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies by supposedly promote a misogynous environment. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a demand against the army that itself center in the diagnoses of &quot;inconvenience of the personality&quot; assigned the victims of violation in order to giving them the high one of the service -a common event, according to the activists, like Anu Bhagwati of the Women Action Network in Service, a group of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Its group presented a demand in December against the Administration of Veterans, accusing of discriminatory practices in the form in which handles the claims of benefits for the people that say to have been attacked sexually in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine government bills have been presented by separated in the Congress on the part of a two-party mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual aggressions denounced, according to the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual Aggression and Answer of the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> Nevertheless, the aggressions notably infra are denounced, and by the own estimations of the Pentagon, that figure in approximately the 13.5 percent of the 19000 incidents reckoned that they were produced that year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, published in March, also examines the indices of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases denounced in the army went to judgment - the half that in the system of civil justice. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, they describe their attacks as alone the first one of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, denounced the presumed violation to the military police less than one hour after to occur. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, he says, him he was asked that he counted the details of his violation 11 different times to a multitude of police officers, medical, and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She was submitted to a kit of violation, and the blood of its aggressor -of a cut in its arm- was found in its bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April of 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which him was asked about that to have had sexual relations with its boyfriend the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people declared as the witnesses of personality in name of the presumed author, that was finally acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;Memory the day in which the verdict read itself&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought that was going to go to work me -I found me shouting since the room.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;They put me in the unit of psychiatry, and when I left, memory that I told him my official of command,&quot; &quot;That was not its judgment. That was my judgment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> To Lyman him was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, that finally an inconvenience of the personality diagnosed him, what did it ineligible for the service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January of 2010 was excused of the service low terms less-that-honorable, what impedes him to receive any benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> As for if the case presented by Lyman and its companions of demand continues, is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of Right in the Faculty of Right George Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nevertheless, it indicates, &quot;In my opinion, they should be capable of continuing ahead&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What is interposed among them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since was published for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have been a permanent critic of the Doctrine Feres. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades from behind because does not have the same incentive and dissuasion that plant the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And it adds: &quot;The odds are hardly against them... but is important for they to try it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These alone things change when the good people is willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the audience does not go for its road, Burke, lawyer of the plaintiffs, will put to the queue to its other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We are going to continue fighting against the army in this theme until the reform be produced&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;Or until we wall us, what occur first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: How the investigators are studying you in Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before being become the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired its points of view anti-immigration in line. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Monday, Breivik, who admitted to have carried out a killing in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, was faced to its first public judicial audience. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik should have acted alone, was far from being alone in the cyberspace: It had passed most of the time that preceded their attack set against their computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists that support to the groups of right in social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the investigators wanted to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, ¿how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy - only you have to enter Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that was not so difficult to arrive at them&quot;, says Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently on the European digital populism by the center of British studies we GIVE. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The alijo of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the investigators would be able simply to utilize the tool of publicity to determine their demographic characteristics desired with a scientific precision - the way that the salespersons have been utilizing during years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Bartlett found half million of fans of the groups of right in every Europe and then directed announcements, but instead of linking them to a new band or product of diet, the announcements invited the users to complete a survey that asked on their educational level, attitudes toward the violence and the optimism on their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Upon arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and its colleagues were capable of studying at more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of far right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a completely new form to do an investigation&quot;, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results they are not of the all surprising: The followers in line of the groups of right tend to be youths, men and angry by the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> Nevertheless, in a species of turn, &quot;those that combine their activism in line with the activism off-line they are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that they remain behind the screen of the computer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work of we GIVE is alone an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of the scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Centers of investigation, medical investigators and political scientists are utilizing the place to study all, from problems of health to social tendencies just as they are expressed in the &quot;I like&quot;, messages in the walls and updatings of state. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million users assets adding an average of three pieces of content to the day, the &quot;supernova of data&quot; of Facebook is generating a boom of the investigation, prompting the number of academic works with the name of the place in the title to almost a 800% in the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some investigators, the beauty of Facebook is that permits you to study the people to the ones that you could not approach you with a folder on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when you tried encuestar to people of the British National Party, was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You would have that to go through the party, and they never would permit you the access&quot;, he says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Other they say that the place would be able to provide a way to identify and to undertake the problems of health-social. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study carried out by the doctor Megan Dark, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues, he found that the university students that spoke of their feats of drunkenness in Facebook had a significantly greater risk to have problems with the beverage that the students that remained in silence on the theme. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Dark it suggests that the companions of the students, such as the residential counselors, they would be able to control the place and to intervene to help a student that publish too many updatings of state with their drunkennesses. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You cannot treat a problem if cannot diagnose it&quot;, he said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Dark and director of the health center, Behavior and Development of the Boy in the Institute of Childlike Investigation of Seattle, the Washington said Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify children in risk that of another way they would not be diagnosed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook also is constantly &quot;puncturing&quot; to its own population to obtain data. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The Team of Data of the place has elaborated statistical on the state of the relation and the Day of San Valentín, the expectation of voter turnout to half of the legislative period of 2010, and an index of National Happiness (chiefly utilizing the information to which can be agreed - defenders of the digital liberty for a long time they maintain that the place should put at the disposal of other its great Quantity of data for the investigation). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Nevertheless, the users of Facebook know that the place is watching, like or not - the sacrifice by being able to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometers of distance is to permit that the place mine your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But ¿what happens when the users of Facebook become a part of a survey that not even they know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While the investigators have well definite guidelines on how collect its data off-line, in line is a free bar for all. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;Do not I believe that many of the users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be examining his profiles&quot;, he says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a study of 2006 that he carried out with the public walls of Facebook of students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;In which to them concerned, was only among them and its friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even off-line, there is not guarantee that a theme of investigation this being completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> In Facebook, is impossible to know that splits of the information of the profile of a user and of the messages of the wall they are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say in Facebook and what cause were of Facebook are two completely different things&quot;, he says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That it is why, in spite of their years as the investigator of the technology, Selwyn he believes that a paper clip and a ballpoint pen continue being the better tools of investigation that nobody can utilize. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is not replacement to enter the real world and to speak with the real people&quot;, says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;The social investigation is supposed that is on the social thing - and a pile of the social thing still happens off-line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik does its first public apparition in the court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man that confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described to itself as a combatant of the &quot;resistance&quot; during its first public apparition in the court of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the movement of Norwegian resistance and in the Gentlemen Templars of Norway&quot;, he said before a full room with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I oppose me to the court, since received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of the hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I recognize the facts but me do not I declare guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted to Breivik during that monolog, because &quot;did not want to give to Breivik the opportunity to utilize this audience as a platform so that express its points of view&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> By the same reason refused to permit to Breivik, that brought a speech written with advance, to be directed the relatives of its victims in the end of the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also the police ordered to maintain to Breivik in custody during 12 weeks more, he prohibited the access to the mass media during four weeks, and he said that the authorities would have that to have a strict control on all the visits and the correspondence during eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the audience. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some they came with the hope to look at to Breivik to the eyes, other to confirm that he is found imprisoned under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All they attended with the objective to advance toward the conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought that cold seemed and inhuman&quot;, a survivor said of Utoya to the issuing one NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was uncomfortable, but for was a step ahead after seeing and to hear the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> They dressed with a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik was maintained calm and professional along the audience and looked at the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when entered and the building left. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In spite of the strange notion of Breivik to be part of a movement of &quot;resistance&quot; greater, the judge determined that he is not a sick mental one, and he said that there is not proof that he acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is possible that to some console them that the attacks of July 22 seem to be work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not smooth out automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feels. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would like that to seem a monster, but him does not seem&quot;, a relative of a victim said. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;Would be a lot more easy if it to seem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 Lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, they are shown in a theater this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs, October 5, there were some that compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of the technology as the Great Modern Inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what the fans of Apple would be able to find more revealing, in an interview to Jobs recently redescubierta to which has been revived like advancement of a series of special projections in the greater markets this week, is how much understood this creative mind about the commercial processes and flows of work of the products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was without doubt a designer, dreamy and hippy autorreconocido, but was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of the flow charts - a man that believed that many executive sufrían &quot;an illness that consists of thinking that a great idea is the 90 percent of the work... [but] There is an enormous quantity of work between a great idea and a great product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the series of television The Triumph of the Nerds (The triumph of the idiots) on the whiteness of the personal computer, and sat down for more than one hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Just then had passed scarcely 10 years since Jobs had been obliged to be gone of Apple, and already worked intensely in its new data processing business NeXT, expecting the popular adoption of Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview of Cringely was utilized in Nerds, said that the original of the interview disappeared during its transportation. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was only after the death of Jobs that a complete copy was discovered in VHS in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This material of file, slightly reprinted, is the base of Steve Jobs: The interview loss, of 68 minutes, that arrives at the movies Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known by hating the interviews in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose its technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And very thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In four different points along the interview, there are large silences among the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is weighing clearly its thoughts, seeking precision. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Also there are moments in which the perfectionism of Jobs leaves to the surface, where seems impatient due to the questions of Cringely, pushing him to go faster toward the themes or arguments of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> It filmed before it was of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The interview loss, when Jobs evaluates what sees that other companies do well and badly, and offers its own vision of the future of the data processing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> A thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the career of Jobs, but there is somewhat raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer to the edge of the greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of as they are able and should be the things. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Not long after explaining it all with detail here, was and did it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A fast summary of seven notable sequences of The interview loss: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> On how did it learn to carry a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;Along the years in the business, I always he asked: &quot;&quot; ¿Why do you do things?&quot; and the answers that give you of invariable form they are: &quot;Oh, that is alone the way as is done&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows why does he do does, in the business nobody thinks about the things very deeply. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs carries to the detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> It disconcerted by the form in the prices were registered - often beginning with a &quot;standard price&quot; that was done to eye of good cooper, and that then was adjusted with a &quot;variable&quot; - developed a factory automated that assured that they would be able to determine the commercial prices to the detail. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the joke to the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs relates the &quot;Blue Box&quot; that himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that permitted to the people hackear efficiently the telephone company and to do calls to long distance free. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> It has written extensively about the device, but the elation of Jobs here upon describing the Blue Box as an act of empoderamiento is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He it describes how and Wozniak tested the box by means of the use of a pay phone, making a call, and then being connected since a network of AT &amp; T to another, while created a loop with the greater quantity of possible satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We were wrapping the things around the world a half a dozen of times and you shouted through the pay phone and returned a minute later to the pay phone of the door from to the side&quot;, says Jobs with a giggle. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were youths and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that would be able to control thousands of million dollars in infrastructure everywhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We two, we did not know a lot, but we could build a small thing that could control a gigantic thing - was an incredible lesson, and do not I believe that never to have existed Apple without her. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that and Wozniak almost they abandon, calling to the Vatican one through the Blue Box in half at night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while did its better imitation of Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> To the extent that various members of the catholic hierarchy were called in half at night to speak with the American diplomat, the two exploded in just laughter before the very same one Pope to be awoke for be going to answer the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> On being fall in love with the technology (and the telephone sales with Bill Hewlett) : </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At age 12, to the hunt of spare parts to build a bookkeeper of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone book and a call made him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after its telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs obtained an employment of part-time summer in Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That was a notable influence on me, was the only business that had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a business and how well they treated their employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs was converted later in one of the employees of HP that visited the laboratories of investigation of the company in High Stick, where he saw &quot;the first never done desktop computer&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen of cathode pipe, and I fell in love with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> It would obtain a trip to HP as the adolescent and waste time with that machine and would write programs for her. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> On improvising the innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> In various points of the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the march. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Soon in its career, since was dedicated to sell a base plates handful, a client asked him if could mount all the team. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working with alone 30 days of credit, had to ascertain the assembly and the delivery of the devices finished. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, while it was in Apple, recalls the fights to the ones that was faced in the development of a mouse of computer: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;Me dramatic agreement to have arguments... they shouted me that five years would be needed [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I satiated me and I was was me and I found a designer. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse that could build for 15 dollars and that was completely reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On the large businesses losing force: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> A lot before headed the renaissance of Apple, Jobs prophetically predicted the form in which many leaders of the industry would trip in their vision, and they would lose the control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;I gave that you work in IBM or Xerox, for which do photocopiers and better printers, ¿and what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market share, for which the business does not have more success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The departments of sales and marketing enlarge the success, for which they are this class of people the ones that finish for directing the businesses and the people responsible for the products are expelled of the forum for it takes of decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius of the products that carried to that position of monopoly rots because of people that do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary position. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what passed in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox would be able to have taken over all the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Would be able to have been ten times its size, would be able to have been the Microsoft of the years 90... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They took the rout of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On the innovation as artistic expression: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is an enormous quantity of work between a great idea and a great product... to the extent that evolves the great idea, changes and grows.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> It is learned a lot about the subtleties of the same one. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that cannot do that do the electrons, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to maintain 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - to adjust them all at the same time... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> In the end all is reduced to the flavor - is lowered to try to expose you maybe that a team of humans has done, and then to try to adapt those things to the ones that your you are doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that the good artists copy, the large artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Never we have had shame about stealing large ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> What in part did large to the Macintosh was that the people that were working in it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, that coincidentally were the better data processing scientists of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it was not by the data processing, could be doing marvelous things in other fields. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the rival of the law of health care while the court accepts the case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> The day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of if they would accept the challenge to the law of health care of the president Obama, two of their judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were guests of honor in a supper sponsored by the firm of lawyers that will expose the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The occasion was the past Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary audience to study in great detail the petitions of review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question was a demand presented by 26 states challenging the total reform of the health care approved by the Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for the conservative activists in all the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to admit to procedure the demand and, in fact, expects a historic summing-up of 5 hours and a half for March, and the result probably will cloud still more the presidential career of 2012, that be in full height just as the decision of the court be known. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer that will appear before the court and will allege that the law should be rejected will be probably Paul Clement, who served as the attorney general of United States during the government of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The firm of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen businesses that helped to sponsor the annual supper of the Federalist Company, a group that carries many years dedicated to the defense of the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another firm that sponsored the supper, Jones Day, represents to one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Confederacy of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., that has an enormous financial interest in the result of the lawsuit. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The supper was celebrated in a hotel of Washington, hours after the preliminary audience of the court on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Among the assistants was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important republican in the Senate and an opponent declared of the law of health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The special guests in the supper? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Company during years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And is not something that among in conflict with the norms ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt of the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If him they were not, would be able to be told that they would fall under the Code Canon 4C, that says: &quot;A judge can attend events to collect funds of organizations related to the law and other, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or to figure in the program of such event. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law practices of lawyers in the case, as well as to a business with an enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm the activists of ethics in the government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This impressive gap of the ethics and indifference toward the code goes against the demands of various judges that obeys the court by the same rules that apply to all the federal judges&quot;, said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause). </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were guests of honor in a gala funds collection with lawyers that have pending cases before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Its apparition and assistance in the collection of funds for this event undermines any demand of impartiality, and is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by the criticisms that say that they mix too much easily the activity of the court with the agenda prompted by groups as the Federalist Company. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a noticeable conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> On the other hand, the conservatives argue that is the judge Elena Kagan, the one that has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan worked as a procuradora general of the administration Obama when the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance were presented. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Its critics have pressured so that Kagan abstain to see the case, saying that was too much involved in defending the law as for now be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has not given any indication that be going to do it. </seg>

<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these clients particularly is very strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines of Middle East are property of their petroleum production companies nations. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore, do not only they have the money to pay the airplanes, but an increase in the prices of the fuel - generally damaging for the airlines, because is one of the greater prices - is not so damaging, because the country is winning money with the increase of the price of the petroleum. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> That is important because they have less odds than other airlines to cancel or to delay the orders of flight when the prices of the fuel enlarge, he said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They have a natural protection&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the wide fuselage airplanes market and aid to maintain to line the intent of its competitive one Airbus BE to invade its control with the passenger plane A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of Boeing in the fair of the air is produced four months after Airbus said that was going to delay the début of the largest one A350, that competes directly with the 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> It delayed the début to add more impulse after the clients to require an increase of the useful load and of the rank. </seg>

<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, to our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and they ordered the people that voted&quot; in favor of the PRI. </seg>

<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but cannot be immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if Chinese and India they can help, that be for all the media.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1735"> In the last days, the prices of indebtedness of Italy have shot themselves dangerously and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The current crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has enlarged the fears that could push to the world economy to the recession and has generated calls so that the main emerging economies unite to help the euro zone to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> The Mister Nag predicted that any support of Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - as the purchase of the bonds of the fund of rescue of the EU, the European Fund of financial stability - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian associates of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, Indian minister of Commerce, he said that &quot;the India is going to do everything possible&quot; to help the euro zone since its own economy now was suffering the fall of the exports and the exhaustion of the foreign capital inflow. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Serious notices of the Pentagon about the possible cuts in defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The secretary of Defense, Lion Panetta, heated the Congress Monday, notifying that the automatic cuts of budget that approach would be able to undermine the national security and to cause a financial reaction in chain since the walkways of the Pentagon, to the fields of battle of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon already is digesting the 450 thousand million dollars of reductions along the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if the Congress does not manage to arrive at an agreement on the expense. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastator for the department&quot;, said Panetta in a letter to the senators John McCain, republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, republican by Carolina Southern. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of the Congress to arrive at an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the call &quot;abduction&quot;, would give rise to 23 percent of global reductions and a high one to many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A so large cut, applied in this manner indiscriminate, would do that most of our naval projects and of construction they cannot be executed - cannot be bought three quarters parts of a ship or a building - and to damage seriously other efforts of modernization&quot;, wrote Panetta to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;Also we would see us obliged to set apart to many of our civil officials of involuntary form and, due to that the reduction would be imposed with so much rapidity, is almost sure that we would have that to graduate civilians in order to complying the objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would break the faith with those that maintain our army and they would damage seriously the good disposition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts with the time would reach to the troops of battle, he said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Though the financing for times of war in the contingency Operations accounts overseas itself is not seen directly affected by the abduction, the efforts of the war would be seen affected negatively by the serious inconveniences in the budgets of base&quot;, notified Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The contracting of personnel would be reduced, what would carry to delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The personnel in payroll would be reduced, giving rise to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time of war, and the legal support and politician would be interrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of an abduction in the Department of Defense would cause a fast slope of the United States as main military power of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are firmly against this draconian action&quot;, the senators in a joint communiqué said the afternoon on Monday when published the letter of Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This it is not a result with the one that can live itself, and certainly is not one that should we impose on ourselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The abduction is a threat for the interests of the national security of the United States, and itself should not be permitted that occur.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> If the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will enlarge the pressure for a budgetary commitment or they will intensify the calls to exempt to the Pentagon of the cuts remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly more clear on the possible cuts, in spite of the fact that arrived at a work in the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that was faced to difficult decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> In a press conference last week, the secretary of Defense painted a somber panorama of what would be able to be in front - an army with a seashell, but not a nucleus. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;Is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;Is a brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is an air wing without sufficient pilots coached.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army of headquarters, buildings and bombs without sufficient soldiers qualified to comply the mission&quot;, said Panetta in its words of opening in the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force that suffers the moral drop, the deficient preparation and is not capable of being maintained to the day with the potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;In fact, invites to the aggression. ..” </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciates new details of how the reductions &quot;generate important operating risks: delay in the time of answer to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; limits severely our capacity to be unfolded and compromised previously everywhere; and supposes an unacceptable risk in future operations of battle.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the greater projects of defense would be able to confront the axe, included those that already they are being tested and some alone in the first phases of the planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Ready happiness includes the airplane of battle F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber predicted, the submarine ballistic of new generation, the new ship of coastal battle and the new vehicle of battle in land that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Stopping the development and the additional tests of the F35 would be able to generate some 80 thousand million dollars in savings along 10 years, but their followers say that is the following vital step to improve and to confront the potential threats of China and other rival. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> As to detect a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look to the most recent holders indicates us how serious and omnipresent are the deceit and the lie in the daily life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each part accuses of lying to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been defendants of perjury by supposedly hide reports that said that a coach of soccer withdrawn was attacking sexually children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone affirming the president of United States, Barack Obama, that the Israeli prime minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The congressperson by New York and exhibitionist on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, did the ridiculous one with its contradicted quickly refuted by the irrefutable test. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in the financing of the campaign related to the cover-up of a relation extramatrimonial. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And, again, nobody that it to live will forget never the media circus untied by the president Bill Clinton upon lying during its second mandate about its sexual relation with Mónica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> They are very extended the legends on the traps in the exams of the school and the university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Cases have been given in which the professors have given the answers of the exams to the students in order to being better seen in its evaluations of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors that should be teaching it opponent are sending the message that to lie and to deceive they are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deceit we find us? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> In a day any, the studies show that they can lie you in any place from 10 to 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> That sure, many of those lies are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that the strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes to be known. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detecting lies, or &quot;the locating of lies&quot;, is an essential ability that should acquire all, by personal so much reasons as the professionals. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a similar board game to, for example, Charade, where the objective is to exclaim: &quot;I have you&quot;, the detection of the deceit is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out projects of investigation in depth, especially in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars yes look at to the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Do not always they stammer, they stammer, they blush or they disturb. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Themselves it cannot be concluded neither that the liars be difficult to detect or to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A lie detector coached can arrive at the truth learning about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, the formation of questions and the times. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I passed various years testing the scientific discoveries on the deceit in the vast and always emerging body of the knowledge, and was of course the detection of the deceit is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include the contracting, interviews, or the management of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars have the ability to read well to the others, causing feeling to flavor, handling their own emotions and feeling of intuitive form how do they perceive them the others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know for the investigations that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that the men say more &quot;lies oriented toward itself&quot;, while the women say more lies &quot;oriented toward the others&quot; -- normally to protect the feelings of someone -- that the married people lie less often to their couples that the people that are not married (but the lies that are used to saying tend to be &quot;enormous&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> Also we know that if you are perceived as a criminal, the others they will feel less guilty upon lying him. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How know if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, it observe the habitual conduct of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This it is called &quot;to create a base-line&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It helps to provide points of reference to measure later the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the position of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is better than knowing if someone normally pounds with the foot all the time for do not unjust accusations when see him the feet pounding in half of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Subsequently, it seek groups of not verbal, verbal, and deceitful behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider to these groups of behavior as warning signs, not like test of deceit. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The people that deceive can freeze the upper part of the body upon trying to recall their history, they can aim their feet toward the door, to be inclined toward an exit, to change their position in a significant way or to exhibit a &quot;relief postentrevista&quot; -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have finished. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Often the interrogators cause they see falsely that the interview has finished alone to seek that relief postentrevista. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also I lend attention to the vocabulary of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Scott Peterson put the leg to the fund and used last time while affirmed that its wife murdered was alive, launching a search of her to national level. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The people that deceive can also use a distancing language: &quot;Did not I have sexual relations with that woman... the young lady Lewinsky&quot; or to repeat a difficult question integrally. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Someone can use a pile of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when answers to a difficult question: “Bueno.. to tell the truth... to what I itself... to my to understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This does that the answer be a perception instead of a fact and is often a warning signal. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is not any magic formula to detect lies, but to develop abilities for discover the deceit is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These abilities will improve the possibilities of any to avoid to be victimized by the artists of the swindle in their personal and professional lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan of the devious pipeline after the threat of the delay of United States in its approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- maddening to the unions, while appeased the ecologists -- the business that seeks to build the pipeline says that is willing redirigir the project to direct it again. </seg>

<seg id="1830"> &quot;This it is a true way of progress&quot;, the representative said Reads Terry, republican of Nebraska, to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is possible that aside any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officials denied that the politics was wrapped in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the petition of the State Department, and all its expressed them support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The pipeline, of 1,700 kilometers would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> It would carry 700,000 barrels for day of the province of Alberto to the refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> For it, it would be necessary that crossed six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> He is hated for the ecologists, but loved by the working parties, that have bet on the estimation of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the legislators of Nebraska opposite to the plan are weighing the legislation to force a removal of the region of Sandhills and of the aquifer Ogallala, the greater source of drinking water and of irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The study of current environmental impact of the State Department found that the alone project presented adverse environmental impacts limited, but the source of the energy industry said that the general inspector of the department has ordered an independent test of the process of review, being centered in two questions. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> An it is if the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, that was advisor of campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2008, he represents a conflict of interest for the program. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other it is if a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate election because was linked to TransCanada. </seg>

<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone approached from behind and he told me,&quot; ¿you Know what is doing your daughter?&apos; I told &quot;yes &apos;and I went to catch it &quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle admonished angry to the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;He said in an aggressive tone,&quot; should Not have left his daughter near the door&quot;, he said Roseanna Monk. </seg>

<seg id="1862"> Climatic adversity braked the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has enlarged the unemployment and the informality, descended the foreign investment and contracted the economy </seg>

<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures of February, besides causing millionaires losses for the agricultural sector, they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, they caused a contraction of the economic activity in general of 3,6 percent in the first semester of the year, justified chiefly by the historic fall of 31,16 percent in the agriculture, that affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors. </seg>

<seg id="1868"> Smaller liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of economics and Social of the OR, the growth of the unemployment can be explained indirectly, in function of the actions that since the public politics they have been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What is being seen is a growth of the unemployment that has to do with various factors, among them the loss of liquidity in the market by effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in the congress to fight the money laundering, already for the people that gets dollars in an illicit way him is not easy that work them, invest them and utilize them in Something&quot;, it expressed. </seg>

<seg id="1980"> It is expected that present a composed cabinet mostly by technocrats, although is not clear when the job will take on the new executive. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said that will present the president the result of its conversations with the political parties in its intent by forming a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to surpass this difficult phase&quot;, the former European commissioner said to journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not he say of explicit form that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been surpassed. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> The &quot;framework is now well delineated&quot;, added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, much less of the normal thing, while Italy fights a financial and political crisis that has prompted the prices of its debt to unsustainable levels. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration directed by the former commissioner European Monti should approve a hard package of austerity required by the European leaders to recover it struck confidence in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Underlining the pressure on Monti so that hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian bonds BTP to 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were seen obliged to be rescued. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian management Confindustria, the press told after being met with Monti: &quot;We said that we would support a lot to this government&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy leave the situation of emergency. </seg>

<seg id="1993"> Parliamentary support </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new Government of Monti should have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be unpopular reforms of austerity. </seg>

<seg id="2000"> After a brief one I breathe to ends of last week, when remained of course Berlusconi would resign, the prices of the Italian debt have returned now to critical levels among the uncertainty on if the new prime minister be successful. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Rescuing to Italy, with a public debt of 1,8 trillion euro, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti has said that its government should last to the next elections, predicted for 2013, despite the predictions generalized on that the politicians only will give time to apply the reforms before advancing the elections. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in their cabinet, but the large parties insist that should be formed only by technicians, an indication of its objections before a process obliged by the financial pressure. </seg>

<seg id="2037"> For their costa rican followers, is a dream done reality that Pearl Jam be going to touch in Costa Rica, ¿they are conscious of what their fans they are living? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Going to Costa Rica is a dream done reality for us also. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is barely our second time in South and Central America and up to now has been magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I have been in Costa Rica alone once and of holidays; is a so beautiful country and I believe that we are going to be able to remain us some days there. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> So it touches us to carry our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I am asked it because exists a species of devotion toward the band, the fans live with intensity the prior days. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What tell them its more fervent followers? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thanks by remaining to our side through all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It took us almost 21 years to arrive at Costa Rica; thanks by to have expected so much and we regret that have us taken so much time in arriving to there. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people even already refers to its concert as the largest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> It adds that a little pressure to its visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the shows larger than we have touched during the last 21 years they happened during the last pair of weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We touch a pair of shows gigantic in Sao Paulo and we expect that that have us placed in form for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Truly, we are very anxious to touch there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love that country, charms us surfear and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the better of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How it was that they discovered Costa Rica and their waves for surfear? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have many friends that are surfeadores and I have a great friend that lives in Tamarind and the waves there are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends always went to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are large places for surfear; thus was how do we inform us, through people that loves the surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Upon seeing the tour, they have come delivering shows enormous with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What have they planned for their presentation in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As never we have touched there before, then we do not have any restriction on what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch a pair of songs of each album and to give them to our fans a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> This why it is owed? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I believe that is partly because we have nine disks and we can touch more than 120 songs and to each one he they like different songs, so is difficult to choose which songs to touch each night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that carry while of touch not, that maintains us focused and also maintains us surprised because recalls we the reasons by the ones that us liked those songs and that could have been forgot us. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That does that the show be more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that also returns it more interesting for the people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of path. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Upon looking at behind, ¿is difficult of believing everything that they have achieved? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> In the first place, I believe that none of us I imagine itself that we would be in a great band of rock and to have done for more than 20 years does that seem like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue counting our blessings and touches us a lot that we can continue doing together music. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> All we want us and charms us to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to places from the world to the ones that always we wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The things could not be better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What signified for you the to have been splits fundamental of the rise of the grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Has always been a honor to be part of that group of large bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice or Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> Is surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is somewhat rare. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Occasionally, a band of a city arises, but is a lot more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time of a same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honest to be part of the group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Still we touch with some of them occasionally. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were in a festival with Alice or Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all they still and honors us to be part of that sound of Seattle that arose. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Also it is very strange that a band as that of you be maintained united and with the same members therefore time. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us we have we are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) united itself us 13 years ago, which, in and of itself, is a lot more time of the one that many bands last. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the first place, I believe that all we are fortunate to be still with life and, in second, all we worry about the others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> All we are very nearby friends and, thanks to that, also musical avenues have been opened that give liberty to each one to experience. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust us the some to the other with the music of each one and could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> The relation of you with the word fame has not been simple; nevertheless, thanks to their success, they have been able to do what quieran. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do they find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> To as we have gone growing, has been easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We assure us that not to be too much of tour because is easy to fall in that play of the large multitudes and of the people that loves your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> While one it recall that the people is there by the music, that recall you that you should respect the music and what brought it, without encapricharse by being famous and to be a rock one star, something that to none of us really interests him. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How recalls its another project Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I believe that we write very good songs and at the beginning was somewhat magnificent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band by almost three years and never we publish a disk until after to die Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There were many frustrations because lasted so much and it more important is that still we are very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), that began in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think about the incredible person that Andy was and how caused laughed me, was always a pleasure to be going to work, reírnos, to speak of music and soccer and a lot more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Was a human Being surprising and we miss him. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national band The Robertas will be the responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is certain that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that therefore they chose it for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that more we liked, so we are anxious to see what The Robertas can offer in alive and should be very entertained. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why always they change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter in alive? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That it is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it and I believe that does it with the first thing that occur him itself. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As bassist, which are its influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> They are so many. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Inside the first that occur they are themselves me Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> They are so many that would be able to speak all the afternoon on the bassists that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has it achieved Pearl Jam to maintain prominent the grunge in spite of be not already a fashion? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I believe that all of us always feel a little offline of the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about her, recalls me the bands that mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that arose at the same time, and, if there is importance now, I believe that is somewhat marvelous because is music that is worth while to listen and bands as Mudhoney are doing now better music than never. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning, its music had a darker content and now has returned more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why this change is owed? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting because I believe that there is a pair of songs in the new album that perhaps they seem lighter, but also there are songs, like The End or Just Breathe that very dark songs they qualify as although they can sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed touched them me, I cried when I listened them and are deeply dark songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that when you grow and there is some trauma in your life and is lost a relative or a friend, those things begin to influence your art and your music and those two songs, without doubt, they represent that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I believe that a happy person can be herself and even so to be able to do music that be dark. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide in the opportunity of the assembly beyond polemics on fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Amediados of the 80, in full height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some lampoons of promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The pamphlet defined the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona metropolitan. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> It is more, a comparison accompanied by itself, in figures, with the Central one Park new york. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park be situated again, in the imaginary one of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalonian capital of the few that themselves they are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification of Collserola as nature reserve impacts in this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference no longer was head Office Park but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of the bear Yogi. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> In these it was until, in September, the City Hall called a megacompetición composed for 16 contests for other so many entrances to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door sender to the idea of park, without doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Or that or someone intends to put doors to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question leaves alone: Collserola, ¿park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The contest, so much by its only organizing side as for which supposes of reflection on the city is the talking point among all the architects people from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost already a recurrent theme to which to throw hand when two members of this old caste of chosen are recognized in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this fact gives foot, exactly, to one of the few coincidences among what three architects people from Barcelona they think, and university professors, that have been presented. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is opportune. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, after being undertaken the coastal front &quot;is done necessary&quot; to debate on &quot;the front of mountain&quot;, every time that the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, itself has not been carries out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It fits to leave from the base that the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among others things by its great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex&quot;, sentence the architect for whom the title of &quot;doors of Collserola&quot; encloses a &quot;trap léxica&quot; : not one must think in them &quot;as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some zones where one must act&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban development world, qualifies the proposal of &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Derived dangers of it &quot;uncertain that is nowadays to project the public space&quot; after the experience lived in the 80 and that had in the zone of the Fòrum &quot;its song of the swan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the own delimitation of some borders on where can be built. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;To limit something is to set already the following step&quot;, that is to say, its I surpass. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;One must think in new urban development instruments, of planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to authentic disasters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Tighter to the question, Mòdol thinks that, simplifying, the side vallesana of Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not&quot;, by an only topographical question. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Mòdol recalls that already exists a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that &quot;should not fall in broken bag&quot;, although thanks the opportunity that the City Hall offers to its guild to intervene in this project &quot;since the first moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And still more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that permits the architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; on if is this technical profile the one that should head the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;all a success&quot;, aims) that have had that to create: &quot;The architects we should be alone a tool&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: &quot;16 cross contests have been called -says- in the sense mountain-sea, but not a longitudinal reading exists, that see and understand the area in its entirety&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> It causes, at least in its case, that have opted by participating in the 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Of another way, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door from to the side. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In its opinion, that yes, the City Hall should guarantee that the stripe immediately over the Round of Dalt should predict, in all its extension, a zone of equipment that performed a smooth transition between the city and the green thing. </seg>

<seg id="2292"> In its conference A technological opinion of the potholes, dictation in the framework of the International Year of the Chemistry, brought to light that the laboratory to its charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with a greater so much, mechanical resistance to high as to low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Blacksmith Nájera reckoned that this type of asphalts modified they would be able to be utilized in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some north cities of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> It explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the petroleum, is a hydrocarbons molecules assembly, some of highly molecular weight, calls pave us, and other of low molecular weight, calls maltenos, that you join they give to the pavement their characteristic behavior viscoelástico. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The behavior viscoelástico of the asphalt consists of that to high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and to 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while to very low temperatures, the asphalt returns fragile, added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The previous thing signifies that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but goes modifying during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, notified the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The investigator of the FQ observed that the streets of Mexico City mostly are covers by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve to the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the most superficial layers the folder is found asfáltica, conformed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each one of the stones that constitutes the folder, aimed, is bathed with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Upon traveling the vehicles and to be generated efforts, this permits that the forces be diffused very well in the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it was a matter of asphalt modified they would be diffused still better, the chemical engineer thought. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the folder asfáltica, abounded, a last layer is placed called folder of tread, which is made of a material of fine stone, that is to say, a sand that also bathes in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is a matter of the layer that is going to be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, should have more forces mechanical that the folder asfáltica and to provide friction on the road. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Upon being the part of the pavement that is going to receive and to diffuse the efforts, the folder of tread requires, likewise, to have the adequate thickness and the material of the one should take care of itself that is done. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, especially the humidity and the variations of temperature, also they are a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he said, because affects considerably the performance of the folder asfáltica. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the land is dampened, the water is diffused in the interior of the folder and is difficult that leave, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a pothole, he said, the first one in being eroded is the movie of running and only later the folder is affected asfáltica, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be attended to the first signs with adequate programs of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the traffic load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, because of it, the thickness of each one of the layers of the pavement should go always in relation to the traffic load and to guarantee that comply, to avoid that potholes be formed often. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Blacksmith notified that still there is a lot that to investigate and to work on the asphalt, for example, the emulsions asfálticas, that in other countries already they are found even in the market and they permit to repair the potholes with facility and without high need to use temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What lacked the candidate of the Valley to be the new young lady Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that impacted so that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Young lady Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> The Valley receives its title number 14 of princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again the Valley of the Cauca remains with the desires of the crown of Young lady Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be complied with to be in the podium of winners, to light up the silver crown and the band that accredit it as new princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic young lady was raised with the crown and the scepter, the department already he adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina themselves a to the legion of women vallecaucanas that have been near the crown but that they were you proclaim princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patrician Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Raise you (1983), Olga María Sands (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consoles Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Today the great question that many cause is ¿What lacked? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result represents the rout of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had all to be the new Young lady Colombia, not in vain he was chosen Queen of the Police and Better Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens as Taliana steep Slopes or Natalia from Navarre who were carried the crown of Young lady Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor that key in the decision is considered that took the First jury to appoint it Princess situates in which he did not convince with its answer to the question &quot;¿Which is that book that has marked you to you and why? done by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Wagon we Read. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> To the interrrogante the vallecaucana responded: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that is a form of culturalizarse, finally I believe that the book that marked me of infancy is&quot; The princeling&quot;, is a quite deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At present I read &quot;Crime and punishment&quot;, is a book of universal literature that all we should read; and nowadays I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called &quot;The ardor of the blood&quot;&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> An answer that little liked first by the term &quot;culturalizarse&quot; and second by explain not in a concrete way of what way each one of the books that cited they have marked it. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But upon finalizing the ceremony Melina declared to be felt tranquil and happy with the result &quot;the universe is wise passes what has to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the people, please they read a little bit one, &quot;The princeling&quot; is a great book&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the hypothesis launched he is said that to Valley the favoritism he burned it. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist of Bogota insinuated that upon being it preferred, it applauded and the candidate that was carried all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote of the public by the best craft suit, and Queen Mother), &quot;that awoke the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine in the setting&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And that it was noted in its first presentation in bathing suit in the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although in both it lit up sure, was noted that the force lacked him and the impetus that the representatives of Mary magdalene and Atlantic yes they showed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;As at home&quot;, of the Channel RCN thought that the fact that Melina to be appointed princess &quot;verifies that the candidate that more prizes desire during the contest does not remain like the queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Besides, Valley was shown to the last thing very I avoid with the press, and there was mistaken. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince to the jury on its interest toward the social work, that is in last, the essence of the National Contest of Beauty. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> By something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they sought a woman compromised with the social needs of its pies. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;The alone beauty does not suffice in a Miss Colombia, one must look at but there of the physical thing and to be centered in its social sensibility, that before entering to the Contest they be already involved in projects&quot;, explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Also it speculates that Valley sinned for its defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that him was noted in its abdomen, but turns out to be contradictory therefore exactly the jury chose it as the candidate &apos;natural Beauty&apos; with the body healthiest, good diet and responsible physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, &quot;but its problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for my was not very notorious, descended him points in the last day&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In the meantime the journalist Guido Pits, of the magazine Chromium considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgeries that was practiced. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The surgeries are well, but Valley was not known them to do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Their body never was its fort and here they charged themselves it&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> By this prize, that for the first time delivers the National Contest of the Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit a cruel forecast arose that last night complied, therefore was told that this was the happy one that Raymundo granted to Melina for give him not the flavor of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the certain thing is that Melina from now on begins a year of reign, not as the sovereign, but like princess, position that offers the possibility to represent to Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the own National Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Nevertheless, she will pass to the history as one of the queens that in spite of its devastating step by Cartagena, aloof the crown was him. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Thus it was the work of the caleño that identified the corpse of Alfonso Gray </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A lofoscopista of Cali passed to the history as the man that confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Gray&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> Last November 4 a lofoscopista of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the man that confirmed the identity of the leader of the Farc: &quot;Alfonso Gray&quot;, through the comparison of its fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven lofoscopistas that labor in the sectional one of the CTI, that week touched the shift of &quot;availability&quot; to Eliazar González, a Roof Port man that carries 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> Upon initiating their career, González worked in municipalities of the Collided, where many times had to be gone for more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place in which were the corpses that should be identifying. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In the 2000 it was transferred to the capital of the Valley and, after carrying out the corresponding courses, specialized itself in lofoscopia, that is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say, of the palms of the hands and of the feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of the operating one against you ally Alfonso Gray to Eliazar they notified him that carried most minimum clothes for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Somewhat large he expected him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday in the night left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> It knew that should identify two corpses and that suspected that one of them was of the man that directed to the oldest guerrilla warfare of the world, for which they asked him that carried the card decadactilar of Guillermo Lion Sáenz (its true name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Nevertheless, when it arrived with the team of investigation to the place in which the corpse was found did not recognize it for its physical aspect, therefore was very different to which had seen in the mass media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Was without beard, dress like a peasant of the zone, without eyeglasses and a lot more thin. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But the tracks do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> It accompanied by a magnifier galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the finger impressions of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Its eye did not fail him: was &quot;Alfonso Gray&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the native man of Port Roof was the responsible for confirming him the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Finch, that yes was a matter of the leader of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the track </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín of Cali the recognition that did the president Juan Manuel Holy to Eliazar González, in the press conference by the operating one against &quot;Gray&quot;, he is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people does not he know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactiloscopia is an exact science, without margin of error, that can come be key in the resolution of crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Aside from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support investigations by crimes as theft and homicide and they confirm the identity of the people captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they are captured, many delinquents present false decrees or do not have roles. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take them the finger impression and we seek them in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The investigator related that, in a case of theft, he touched him to remove a piece of wall of a house, therefore in that place the thief had supported his hand to remove a full strong box of jewels and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because are not appropriate surfaces to remove a finger impression, but in that case we could obtain the track of all the hand and to identify the delinquent, that had participated in different thefts&quot;, recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> The tracks can also rule out or to reaffirm suspects in cases of homicide. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> It does little they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Through the investigation was determined that a relative could be a suspect of the crime and, really, a track in the bottle coincided. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not it guarantee that have been the murderer, yes locates it in the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A dactiloscopista of the CTI explained that in the objects &quot;the tracks are removed with chemical or physical reagents&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, a transplantador is utilized or tape to raise them. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After this, the impressions are envoys to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the Registraduría. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that still there are many Colombians lacking identity papers&quot;, indicated the expert of the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> It clarified that not all is like is shown in the program of television CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As well as everything that does not shine is gold, not everything that is touched returns track. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Nevertheless, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The &quot;indignant&quot; they challenge to authorities in New York </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded before the plaza Zuccotti to camp. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A great part attended the eviction order and was transferred to a paruqe nearby. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Occupies Wall Street challenged this Tuesday to the authorities of new York upon trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to the plaza of Manhattan of where they were ousted of early morning and upon trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators crowded before the plaza Zuccotti, where they wanted to agree thanks to a court order that permits to the &quot;indignant&quot; to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park more to the north of the city, where there has been new detentions. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that, if the court does not permit us to camp again in the plaza, we are going to install in some another place and we will continue the legal battle by returning to Zuccotti, as well as through seated and peaceful demonstrations&quot;, one of the spokesmen of the movement said &quot;Occupies Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray detailed that the answer of the &quot;indignant&quot; to the eviction of its dictated camp personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings emitted an order that prohibited the compulsory evacuation of the place and permitted the demonstrators to be maintained camped. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> Besides, the &quot;indignant&quot; they proceeded to the occupation of a new park situated in the confluence of the central Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the tunnel Holland, that unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least during an hour they managed to occupy the place, but later the Police responded and he proceeded to stop to some of the demonstrators, although Bray he could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured to Efe that saw various journalists that were also shackled. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization assures that are various hundreds of people the ones that had been installed on that point, where already a delegation of religious leaders in sample of support has been displaced to the members of the movement and that tried to mediate with the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> In the meantime, the plaza Zuccotti -that is a precinct of private property- continues closed to the wait of the celebration of a predicted judicial view for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this early morning should be analyzed. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Some of the demonstrators displaced persons to there they carried and they distributed at this hour you copy of that court order and even the agents delivered them that guarded the plaza, what caused &quot;some small clashes&quot;, indicated Bray, who denounced that some officials gave blows to the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The court order prohibits to the authorities to oust to the members of Occupies Wall Street or to apply &quot;laws that were published after began the occupation or to prohibit the demonstrators to agree again to the park with stores or other properties that utilized previously&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The mayor Bloomberg indicated before the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, to the ones that alerted, nevertheless, that the local laws do not permit them to install again with tents and bags to sleep. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> The manager defended personally the eviction carried out of early morning of the plaza Zuccotti, an operation in which proceeded to around 200 detentions and that was decided because the demonstrators were &quot;violating the law&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the plaza because this was being converted &quot;in a place in which the people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do damage to other people&quot;, since &quot;some business had received threats&quot; and the neighbors feared &quot;by their quality of life&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The eviction of this early morning was filthy and shows that in the fund Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that the of the American workers&quot;, added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of &quot;to lack the respect to the freedom of speech&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> The responsible for &quot;it Occupies Wall Street&quot; they indicated also that think to organize &quot;large actions&quot; for Thursday in contribution with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests last, that began September 17. </seg>

<seg id="2398"> Next to Michael Bublé and other noticeable Canadians, will appear in the program of television &quot;It&apos; s to Russell Peters Christmas&quot; the next one 1 of December </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Even Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, rescue worker in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, rabbit of &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of the musician of rock Tommy Reads and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin one María in a special one of Christmas of the Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private channel of television CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the &quot;crooner&quot; (ballad writer) Michael Bublé and other noticeable Canadians, will appear in the program of television &quot;It&apos; s to Russell Peters Christmas&quot; the next one 1 of December giving life to a very Virgin individual María. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV distributed today images of the program of television in which Anderson, also known by the extensive distribution on the internet of a pornographic homemade video in which appears along with its then husband, the battery of &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot;, Tommy Reads, dress appears like the Virgin one María maintaining in a manger a dummy that represents Jesus. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a funny acquaintance Canadian of Indian origin that recently acted as the presenter in part of the tour &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; of Charlie Sheen, appears like José. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Besides Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas one of CTV counts on the Canadian singer Bublé, that to the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the model one Argentina Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &quot;vixen&quot; to the American one Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan reborns after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> The GDP grows a 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that initiated in March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since the past month from March the Japanese economy was found paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that occurred in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe than suffered the Japanese country since the II World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo coded the material losses in 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the gross domestic product between July and September served to pass page, finally: the GDP was increased a 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and a 6% in rate annualized. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The registered one in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March of 2012 - supposes, besides, the major rhythm of growth since the period from January to March of 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is explained, in part, by the recovery of the purchase of machinery to restore the zones leveled by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, the businesses enlarged its investments in a 1,1%, set against the descent of the 0.9% in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first backward movement after six months of uninterrupted ascents. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Nevertheless, the true enema of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively in the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or to reconstruct - the infrastructures, to be served of the lacks for grow from zero. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan has awoke, above all, thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, that currently represents the 60% of the Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable scaled a 1%, pushed by the increase of the expense in vehicles, trips and activities of leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the &quot;values refuge&quot; chosen by the investors that flee the crisis of debt in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of United States, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger currency, the products turn out to be more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic waterline comes determined by the health of the large technological groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed its weak results between July and September to the quotation of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not low the guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;One must be attentive to the risks that persist, like the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the fast appreciation of the yen&quot;, indicated yesterday the secretary of state of Economic Politics, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And, in fact, the perspectives do not turn out to be encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organization for the Cooperation and the Economic Development (OCDE) needed that the majority of the member countries they presented in September clearer signs of economic slowing. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the points of inflection in the world economy put of relief that the main powers are being braked. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Since descended four tenths to the 100.4 points, set against the 100.8 of August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The euro zone, even, was situated under the average, that is found in the level 100, upon being precipitated eight tenths to the 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens feeds again the doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will sign no commitment written </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With the cousins of peripheral risk shot and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parquets, Greece continues entangling in the labyrinth that conducts toward the exit of the great crisis of European debt. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The sensation that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek transition government comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels that by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, notified yesterday that there is not alternative for the structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days agreed in its designation perhaps remain short to apply them, the leader of the party conservative New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that will support new measures of austerity in no case and reiterated its demand of new elections for the predicted date, February 19. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summit of October 26&quot;, asserted Papadimos upon opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that tomorrow with a vote of confidence will culminate to the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package with 24 programs to prompt the employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of the officials and new measures against the tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Nevertheless, the message of Samaras not clear the doubts on its position: &quot;We have compromised to help the transition government, but us we have compromised to nothing more&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The conservative leader was a step further in its pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that should release the 8,000 million that Athens needs urgently, and clarified that will not give its seen good to any compliance commitment letter of the adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, escocida still by the impact caused by the órdago of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: will not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign &quot;a commitment written without ambiguity and as soon as possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The spokesman of Economic Matters, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will return &quot;very quick&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;what is needed for pay the sixth section&quot; of 8,000 million, although do neither there is final date. </seg>

<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continues working&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;to all the corners of the planet, and assumes this task with&quot; responsibility&quot;, indicated Mrs Sofía, that expected that the initiatives and contributions that be originated in the Summit, that will be prolonged to Thursday, &quot;they guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and above all for the women&quot;, main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> They are &quot;many achievements reached&quot; and &quot;many the challenges to the ones that we face us&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Summit of the Micro-credit be planted not only as a forum of debate, but also like the platform since the one that to prompt &quot;two basic goals&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, Its Majesty explained that aspires to that by the end of 2015 they be 175 the millions of poor families that have agreed to these financial products and that a hundred million those homes leave the threshold of poverty in which they are plunged. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The impulse in the conception of the micro-credits in Spain and in the remainder of the world &quot;has followed the path initiated years ago of pioneering form&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, projection Mrs Sofía as an &quot;act of justice and recognition owed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And the fact is that described the father of this tool as an &quot;idealistic admirable in the universal cause of the fight against the poverty&quot;, whose work knows since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the land her politics of loans. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> To this experience they continued him a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other encounters as them celebrated in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;in all I have been able to verify the continuous evolution&quot;, explained Its Majesty, whose link with this project was worth him yesterday the description of the &quot;head of family&quot; congregated in Valladolid on the part of the &quot;baquero of the poor&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Mrs Sofía concluded its intervention encouraging to the presents to participate in the debate and in the search of solutions to advance in the fight against the poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Imperative ethical&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The minister of Exterior Matters, Trinity Jiménez, notified that the solidarity &quot;is an imperative ethical one&quot; for democratic every state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, exposed that would be an error to link the cooperation with developing countries to epochs of economic prosperity, since is a &quot;permanent obligation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jiménez considered that the micro-credits suppose &quot;a rigorous and serious politics dedicated to eradicate the poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of countries developed should work low criteria of solidarity and not to leave that this be victim of the cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, the micro-credit consists of &quot;one of the main lines of cooperation to the development&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> In turn, the International Cooperation State Secretary, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; to give &quot;confidence&quot; to the people &quot;excluded to whom all they close the doors&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Lion of it Review, welcomed to the presents to a city that &quot;opens its doors infected of the supportive spirit&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal vote </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 of November, in Leipzig, has elapsed without large difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> Initially itself it had not been included in the order of business the future of Europe, but the theme was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy the militants that consider that the politics of the Government is at present too little strict with the Greeks and could be it in a future with the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the proposed, European Commission by the direction, was adopted practically unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Of the 1,001 delegates, so alone nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of various minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finances, they clear any possible doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, itself summary in a motto: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not alone because Europe supposes the peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly of the euro&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the hour to break has arrived through in Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This would be able to be declared in modifications of the tried Lisbon to permit to reinforce the control of the European Union on the budget policies of the countries of the zone of the euro, although would also be able to flow into in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote for &quot;to give him a face to Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In every case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Without doubt, turns out to be little probable that the twenty-seven arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is shown hostile before him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the ball is on the land. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> On the other hand, the delegates have rejected for an overwhelming majority the proposal to praise the weight of each country of the board of directors of the European Central Bank in function of the weight of each economy, which evidently would reinforce the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Anxious by calming the spirits in the interior of its party, the Chancellor has enlarged the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is neither that have tried to be won to its congress at the cost of the &quot;small&quot; European countries or of the countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant one Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of &quot;the Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel has not mentioned to France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Save of past. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle was produced in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, was one of the most humiliating routs for the army of Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The incident of the fraud in the drops by illness </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government they undertake an offensive against the drops by illness. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 of November in Burgundy to visit a box responsible for the family subsidies and to deliver a speech on the theme, already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against the social fraud and the assistantship. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Besides, to accompany such offensive, that splits of the rigorous will to save of form, but even so recalls to an axis of the presidential campaign of right, the majority wants to be centered in the drops by illness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> In the first place, to apply spending cuts: the Government foresees to impose on the workers of the private sector a fourth day of lack before be able to catch the drop. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In final, unless a covenant of specific business exist, a worker that fall sick would lose four days of salary, that is to say, a minimum of the 15% of its monthly incomes. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> It is a matter of a measure that would be able to raise a wave of ira, but that would permit to save 280 million euro, according to Them Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Besides, it would go accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic reach: to impose on the officials a day of lack without remuneration in case of labor drop (up to now, they do not have lack, set against the three days that apply in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While they debate these questions, the majority puts again on the table likewise the theme of the fraud, this time oriented toward the abuses of the labor drops. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;They are going to increase considerably the controls and, besides, if is discovered someone committing a fraud, should refund the amounts&quot;, notified Xavier Bertrand speaking in the RTL Sunday 13 of November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Just like in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate for the reality of the fraud in matter of labor drops. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> In fact, since 2002 a constant monitoring of this question is carried out and diverse political offensives have been launched that, normally, they have given fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French do not make ill more than in the remainder of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> We observe with attention, in the first place, the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the French Institute of the social security (CNAM), in 2006 they were credited more than 237 million euro in benefits by labor drops. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute of investigation and documentation in economy of the health, the subsidies by the drops represented, in 2008, the 5% of the sanitary expense, elevating to 11,300 million euro. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this sum, the 46% corresponds to the drops by maternity and by industrial accidents, while the 54% is related to the drops by illness, figure that elevates to 6,200 million euro. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Consequently, the 2.5% of the expense in health. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have caught an average of 14.5 days of labor drop, set against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Soul Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average that, without doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management Monster.com, showed that the 75% of the 40,000 polled French wage earners they affirmed that they had not caught neither a single day of drop by illness. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the drops by illness they had a lower duration to 8 days, the 22% from among 8 and 14 days, the 15% from among 15 days and a month, the 15% from among one and three months and the 11% more they were prolonged. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> If we compare them with our European neighbors, the French workers are not more prone than in other zones to catch drops by illness. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study carried out in 2010 for two investigators of the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence of the work (so much by reasons of health as of another type) oscillated, in France, between the 10% and the 11%, set against a 20% and a 28% in Denmark, a 15% in United Kingdom or between a 16% and a 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud in the drops by illness does not turn out to be especially significant in comparison with the work done not declare. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The fraud has an enough reach limited. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has caused that the controls of the drops by illness of more than 45 days be systematic. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in a 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that the drops of short term were &quot;unwarranted or too long&quot;, that is to say, 37,050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the drops of more than 45 days, submitted to systematic inspections, was considered that the 11% of the cases they were &quot;properly adapted or unwarranted; a figure that, having as parted a total of 1.2 million, elevates to 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Consequently, a total of 169,000 cases is reached &quot;unwarranted&quot; among various millions of workers that caught a drop by illness. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Without doubt, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with the work in black. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the representative of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this question in June, practical happiness would represent some losses of fiscal incomes from among 9,000 and 15,000 million euro to the year, that is to say, more than the total price of the subsidies by drops and, without doubt, considerably more than the fraud in this last environment. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece should apply a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to straighten its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what declared Monday 14 of November, the prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before to the Parliament; added likewise that the a hundred days that have been granted to their Government of union they would not suffice to reach such objective. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To carry out efforts that carry to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European associates and a new program of budgetary adjustment&quot;, declared the Leader of the Government, that pronounced its first public speech during the inauguration of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The execution of the decisions adopted during the Summit of the zone of the euro October 27 will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, since &quot;is in play&quot; the continuance of the country in the zone of the euro, added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the public deficit of the country will be reduced &quot;until around the 9%&quot; of the GDP before end of year, after reaching a 10.6% in 2010 and a 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right rejects new measures of austerity </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the group of right, showed Monday its support to the measures already approved to try to leave the crisis of the debt, but has notified that its party will not compromise with measures of additional austerity. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures&quot;, affirmed during a meeting with the representatives of its party &quot;New Democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> It indicated that was according to the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt, as well as of fight against the waste, but against any politics that impede the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner of Monetary and Economic Matters, that notified that the IMF and the EU would not release the loan of 8,000 million necessary euro without a guarantee written of the support of all the parties to the measures predicted, Antonio Samaras has responded that its word would be sufficient and that would not sign anything on account of the external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> A committee of experts affirms that they should be legalized the euthanasia and the suicide attended </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians live denying the death, as indicates the report of the Real Company of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In matter of mitigating cares, the committee demands that the governments, the institutions of health care and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the better mitigating cares, and not alone in the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian company lives denying the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> In fact, so alone 9% of the Canadians is willing to speak with their doctor on the conditions in which they desire to die and take dispositions to such effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It is a matter of one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Real Company of Canada, that included the participation of six experts of diverse environments, included the ethical one, the legal one and the doctor. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends the Government that modify the penal Code so that be permitted the suicide attended and the euthanasia, when the patient be planted said option and has been judged competent to decide. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> To begin, the experts cite a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada occupies the tenth position, the study indicates that &quot;the medicalización of the death in Canada has generated a culture in which the people are afraid to treat the theme of the death&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> With medicación or not, the 77% of the Canadians do not they have access to mitigating cares, as indicate the experts selected by the Real Company of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And, in spite of the fact that the majority of the Canadians desires to die at home, the 68.6% of them finishes passing away in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> As a group, the highest rate in this sense registers it Quebec, where a 86% of the deaths is produced in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In the relating to the delicate theme of the euthanasia and of the suicide attended, the authors of the report arrived at some conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, that already has declared that does not desire to modify the penal Code in relation to the euthanasia and the suicide attended. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Nevertheless, according to the experts, that also they have studied the situation in all the countries where practical happinesses have been legalized or they do not constitute a penal crime, there is not any proof that the fact that they be not you considered a penal crime has not caused an abuse of their application, that is to say, the utilization of the euthanasia or of the suicide attended with not competent people or that they had not given Their consent. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Jocelyn Downie, coautora of the report, affirmed yesterday by teleconference that, to the contrary, excesses in those countries were observed more where themselves have not been legalized the euthanasia neither the suicide attended. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;In Canada the euthanasia is practiced, although is clearly illegal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;In Canada the suicide attended is practiced, although is clearly illegal&quot;, explains Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians, favorable to the euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> We recall that the 85% of the Canadians already they have been pronounced in favor of the euthanasia, since they think that would permit the people whose death be next to alleviate its suffering, as indicates a survey of Angus Reid carried out in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> Besides, the 66% it believes that the fact to legalize the euthanasia will not give understand that the life of the elderly or disabled people has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people that have practiced the suicide attended, the 41% of the polled thinks that should not be initiated a process against them. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In relation to the maintenance or interruption of the health care to a patient, the situation does not turn out to be so clear, they as indicate the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Besides, among its recommendations they suggest that be indicated in the penal Code that the withdrawal of the sanitary cares, if they have been rejected legally, does not suppose a penal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The committee of experts asks likewise that be formed the sanitary professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejection the assistance in the end of its life without fear to be faced to an accusation. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In matter of mitigating cares, the committee demands that the governments, the institutions of health care and the doctors collaborate to guarantee the better mitigating cares, and not alone in the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in relation to the mitigating sedation or terminal, that already is utilized extensively in the sanitary institutions of Canada, the committee asks that, unless serve to reduce the physical pain, be considered like euthanasia and be submitted to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Other experts declare reserves </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Other experts of the environment of the Right of health already have declared their reserves in relation to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Company of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, specialist in Right of the health, qualified as &quot;extreme&quot; the position of the experts that sign the report, among others things because itself not the practice of the euthanasia to the sick terminal is limited. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This leaves the open door to a situation in which someone that be tired to live and have more than 18 years can ask aid to be killed&quot;, indicates Deschamps, that consulted yesterday a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> The Mister Deschamps emphasizes likewise that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any another value of the company. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Now well, it adds that &quot;in company, there are labels and limitations&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The specialist in Right of the health Margaret Somerville also expressed his &quot;strong opposition&quot; with regard to the conclusions of the report, that qualified as &quot;manifesto in favor of the euthanasia&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, that also belongs to the Real Company of Canada, puts in fabric of judgment especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where the euthanasia and the suicide attended they are legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregón. </seg>

<seg id="2602"> Later, he is believed that he cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its last report, the AIEA mentions that they exist &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a system of nuclear detonation &quot;with the aid of a foreign expert, that not alone knew well the technique, but also, has reported a member State to the Agency, worked during most of its career in said technology in the program nuclear soldier of its country of origin&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> Introduction of a &quot;golden rule&quot; budgetary in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The Government of great social democratic/christian democrat coalition that is in the power in Austria has determined Tuesday to include in the Constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; budgetary to reduce the public deficit and, thus, to avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria on the part of the agencies of credit qualification (triple TO). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It was the own social democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Cabinet, when the Austrian public debt reaches the 74,6%, a figure very over the maximum limit of the 60% set by the tried Maastricht, but clearly lower to the debts of countries as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If the reliability of Austria in a single level was reduced, of AAA to AA +, we would have that to pay 3,000 million euro more in interests each year&quot;, indicated the christian democrat Vice-chancellor of Exterior Matters, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria responds thus to a petition of the Summit from Brussels to the member countries of the zone of the euro of last October 26: in her, the Heads of state and of Government they asked the inclusion, before ends of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and of the recovery of the equilibrium of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The device adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the &quot;model German&quot;, since Germany was the first European country that adopted that type of &quot;rule&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> Before 2017, the structural public deficit should diminish each year in a 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, from the 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not surpass each year the 0.35% of the GDP, while the regional States, as well as the comunas, they should present stable budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The objective consists of that, toward 2020/2021, the public debt be reduced under the criterion of the 60% set by the tried Maastricht. </seg>

<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will intervene, just as we did it the last time, if we verify that an excessive volatility is produced&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Noda to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Tuesday, the yen elevated until reaching some next levels to the historic maximums that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities October 31. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> That day, Tokyo sold en masse yens by dollars to descend the value of the Japanese currency, that had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the American currency. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen has gone mending gradually since then, prompted by the purchases of investors that consider it a &quot;value refuge&quot; in these uncertain times of world economic slowing and of crisis of debt in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The dollar to be quoted again Tuesday to less than 77 yens and the euro has descended under the symbolic bar of 105 yens, reaching some next levels to the ones that caused the last intervention. </seg>

<seg id="2651"> Still they worried about the stability of the stability of the zone of the euro, the European markets sink a little more in the negative zone Tuesday 15 of November. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris, at 10 o&apos;clock, the CAC 40 loses a 1.4% and is situated to 3,064 points. </seg>

<seg id="2654"> &quot;Keeping in mind the new tensions in relation to the performances of the loans of the States of the zone of the most affected euro, the stock markets of the entire world continue yielding part of their recent profits&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> &quot;The investors, nervous, they are perfectly conscious of the risk of contagion&quot;, explains Terry Pratt, institutional runner in IG Markets, cited by the agency Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Market of Tokyo has closed with a fall of 0,7%, renewing the worries of the administrators of the market in relation to the capacity of Europe of containing the crisis of the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, like the remainder of the world, has the fixed look in Europe and the exchanges will continue being carried out in a margin of variations reduced, so that the investors will not have proof that the situation has been stabilized&quot;, considers Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds in Ichiyoshi Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The reappearance of the worries by the future of the zone of the euro affects to the single currency, that continues descending Tuesday. </seg>

<seg id="2662"> The Italian types and Spaniards surpass amply the 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> The credit types of Italy and Spain remain to some very worrying levels. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> Tuesday morning, the performance of the Italian obligations to 10 years reached the 6,85%, while the Spanish titles to the same time limit offered a 6,2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, although also of France, they continue feeding the fears of the administrators. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The leader of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, that runs the risk to be suffocated with the weight of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek prime Minister Lucas Papademos, in turn has affirmed that the application of the decisions adopted in the Summit of the zone of the euro October 27 would be the &quot;main work&quot; of its Government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain is found in the aim of the markets, while Sunday the legislative elections will be celebrated there. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The difference of the types (&quot;spread&quot;) among the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain, has reached a new historic maximum. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> To the wait of the figures of growth of the zone of the euro </seg>
<seg id="2671"> Since the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of the 0.4% in the third quarter, that is to say, a more favorable figure than the 0.3% predicted, prompted by the domestic consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The Insee, nevertheless, has revised downward the figure of the second quarter, with a reduction from the 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> Besides, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries the economists. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Germany, in turn, has registered a growth of the 0.5% in the same period. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> Itself prevén the first forecasts for the assembly of the zone of the euro at 11 o&apos;clock, after the European Commission have notified on the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policies: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> the facts should be worth more than the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is a theme that itself cannot treat keeping in mind considerations of short time limit or simply thinking about the emotions, is the energy policies. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and the price of the electricity influence directly in the purchasing power and in the competitiveness of the businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Turns out to be adequate that an electoral encounter be the moment to reflect on such questions and on the place of the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate only will turn out to be useful if studies the assembly of the environmental, social, and economic consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French should base their opinion in objective facts, in rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Now that we are 7,000 million people in the planet, the demographic evolution will suppose the duplication of the electric demand before 2050, unless be deprived to an enormous part of the world population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, there will be that to alleviate the shortage each greater time of the resources fossils to continue producing electricity continuously, without forget the imperious need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases for fight against the climatic change, a theme that has disappeared of the ecological debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima modifies none of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce the nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> That it is not the case neither of Belgium, that submits his to the need to find a capable source to substitute it, neither of Switzerland, that only considers objective to build head offices of the latest generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, south Africa, Chinese, India and Brazil, by citing some examples, they continue ahead with decision with their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, by their side, after Fukushima they decided to add a unit to their park, taking up again the construction of a head office interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, based on the renewable energies, is presented from time to time as an example, the reality goes against such speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The election of Berlin is going to suppose an increase of the price of the electricity, a greater energy dependence by the need increased of gas imported, particularly of Russia, an increase of the emissions of CO2 by the gas head offices construction and of coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In some months, the damaging effects will be noted. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> He should be meditated on the case of Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Champion of Europe in the Aeolian sector, of which obtains the 30% of their electricity, is also one of the large users of coal and of gas due to the intermittence of the wind; by this reason, its emissions of CO2 and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and a 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policies, our neighbors credit a bill of electricity a 40% superior to that of the French homes. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in an economy globalized the price of the energy constitutes a key factor of the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, the French businesses are benefited of the cheapest electricity of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> By that reason, any significant reduction of the nuclear energy would suppose a strong ascent of the price of the electricity, what would reduce realism to the marvelous statements on the restructuring of industry of our country and the defense of ours purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> It is a matter of a price that the great majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not declare opposition by principle to that type of energy, they as show the surveys. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> We recall that the energy policies of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Extensively it oriented to the export, covers a galaxy of pymes they specialized in the international markets and that can create jobs not deslocalizables. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France to decide to abandon the nuclear energy, would suppose the sacrifice of great part of those PYME and the loss of the 6,000 million annual euro in French exports of equipment and nuclear services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electrician would entrust an EPR designed to function sixty years, when is predicted the cave-in of its manufacturer? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the equation of the nuclear energy, one must admit that not a miraculous source of production of electricity exists, just like neither a diabolic source exists. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development on the part of Areva of solutions with low emissions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary character of the sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of the nuclear energy, turns out to be indispensable to maintain the maximum level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have an Authority of security that exercises a so much transparent and strict control on the existing head offices as on the construction of Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, of recognized professionalism, they are also obsessed by the security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> So alone one, that of Three Mile Island, was produced in some normal operating conditions; did not cause consequences neither for the people neither for the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobil, the accident itself due to the design of the reactor and to some inexcusable human failures. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident themselves due to two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented reach, that caused the death of scores of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear sector will learn of this accident, just as did it of the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Thanks to these progresses and to a cooperation among the authorities of security, and the users and German and French builders, the EPR presents a capable design to resist to such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While all the they study it electric actors that desire to build a head office, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since clearance would leave them to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It turns out to be indispensable and legitimate to seek the better energy options for our country, but would be irresponsible to leave that the emotion, the dogmas and the partisan maneuvers dominated a so important debate for the social, economic situation and financier of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The immigration, ¿a load or an opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The politics of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized leaving since diverse points of view: the saturation of the administrative, judicial, and police services submitted to the politics of figures, the compatibility of this politics with the self-proclaimed statute of &quot;country of the human rights&quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, it is the administrative harassment of the foreign students the one that has jumped the holders, with the Minister of Interior (see the periodic one Libération of May 23) proclaiming of past that France &quot;does not need working, foreign talents neither waiters&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Nevertheless, rare time is analyzed since the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The question is that, on this theme, there is enough consensus between the left and the right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation declaring in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that counts on near two million immigrant workers&quot;, while in the left, the tone set it Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot be takes charge of all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, so much the left as the right they shared the fear to the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> To both sides, is considered that the immigrants are a load for the economy and the French company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the one that act with regard to the immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its program, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the codesarrollo will permit to solve the &quot;problem of the migration&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of the immigration as a load, a problem, perhaps turns out to be profitable electorally, but economically leaves very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Just as they indicate the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that summarizes the most recent know-how on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Defines Our Future, May of 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), an extensive consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth exists, the salaries and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limitation of the immigration weakens the growth and damages to the employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears related to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these they can replace the national workers, particularly to the little qualified, pressuring so that its salaries be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more well complementary than replacements of the national workers and exercise chiefly professions in sectors with lack of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The immigrants little qualified work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where the formation does not satisfy the demand of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on the salaries </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country that have lack of anesthetists, the complementariedad between national and immigrants he causes that the arrival of these last he influence positively in the salaries and the employment of the national. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Keeping in mind the previous thing, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of the 1% of the migratory flows supposes an ascent of the long-term real salaries from among a 0.6 and a 0,9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And, without keep in mind the fact that the diversity that contribute the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economic growth (a great proportion of American Nobel prizes exists naturalized and businesses as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The immigrants are also net taxpayers to the social systems, since they contribute of average a 1% of the total budget in the European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Organization of the Work calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant that arrive with an age of 30 years will carry out a net contribution (incomes less expenses) of 150,000 euro to the public budgets of average during all his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> At the beginning of their mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to be going to seek the points of growth that lacked him &quot;with the teeth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Said teeth, that dissuaded the immigrants, they had exactly the inverse effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented the democracy, alone lacks him to think about a European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> The democracy is a well precious, but also fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent would should to be able to be agreed of it since, although was invented in Athens does more than two thousand years, along the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some perhaps they believed that, so that the democracy succeeded finally on its enemies, would be sufficient to exercise the vote and of the way more direct possible. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, from Napoleon &quot;the Small one&quot;, that was a matter of something thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal vote, although is a matter of a necessary condition for the democracy, is not sufficient in and of itself and even can become an &quot;instrument of oppression&quot;, as the republican philosopher said old Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> Not, the democracy requires a lot more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, social and economic solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis that live in Europe is an economic crisis, but is on the verge of being become a crisis political and democratic. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The recantation of the true-false Greek referendum had, to this respect, a double revealing effect: showed the need of a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sensation of its impossibility, of its inconsistency. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> It should be reflected on this ambivalence to surpass it. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle at present have been displaced and that, in many cases, the republican soldiers no longer advance in the good sense. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We will not come out ahead if we require a succession of national referenda, organized in function of the needs and of disorderly form. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank firm to the absolute European monarch or a high one in a vacuum of the nationalist hole: What options for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> Not, do not we want to remove blows of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, tranquil and continuous, of the options and the democracy, this time to European scale. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is not crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because alone there is a crisis, the crisis of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> The totality of Europe is the one that fold to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of qualification, that the one that suffers its impotence and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> Is the assembly from Europe the one that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but is every Europe the one that loses slowly the sovereignty and, with her, each one of its nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> It more urgent is that the popular sovereignty recover the rudder of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because only together they will be able the Europeans to reduce the weight of their debts, to be freed of the markets and to prepare their future by means of the investments. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit of the crisis will require decisions to European scale that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, unless be to conduct us to the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After it to have fought for a long time against this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone asks currently a gobernanza economic European. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> That thus be. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think about her without a greater democratic and political integration, and without being lived like such by the citizens, would be a new insanity and would carry us to a new break-even point. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We should assume a new phase of the European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To build the Republic in France, was precise &quot;to do&quot; republican. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution motivated by interests would not be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson continues being applicable. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We should build an Europe more integrated since the economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Only it will be able to manage to building an Europe more democratic in the political plan, a true European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> To build Europe, we do Europeans. </seg>

<seg id="2773"> The world parlor of the cards of chip is initiated Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> In fact, the year 2011 should finalize with an increase of the 11% in the world sales of cards with microprocessors (banking cards, telephones with cards SIM, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations of the cabinet Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The most powerful segment is that of the technology without contact, that permits to credit the transportation in common or the purchases simply approaching the card to a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year 460 million cards with chip without contact will be sold everywhere, ¡320 million more than the previous year! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Its quota should continue enlarging in 2012 (itself prevén 580 million units) and to represent near a 10% of the world market of the cards with chip (6.925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe, that carries a lot of left behind time with regard to the region of Asia-Peaceful, is gaining ground in the sector of the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Around 26 million cards banking Visa already they have this function, that is accepted in 75,000 terminals of payment. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, its starts are more modest: are being utilized 400,000 Visas cards without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But the large surfaces work for four. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has emitted this year 2.5 million cards Pass Mastercard without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To put the upper march, nevertheless, is necessary that the banks put them at the disposal of its clients. </seg>

<seg id="2785"> The banks test the by telephone mobile payment </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But so alone it constitutes a first phase toward the middle of payment of the future: the mobile telephone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Currently, few devices equipped with the technology exist NFC (Near Field Communication), indispensable to carry out the transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;They are being delayed&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But it would owe at last to experience a true boom next year&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We predict that they will be sold between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 everywhere&quot;, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks take the front. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and the next one June in they Fall. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone will be equipped of around 200 clients and collaborators with a case that permits the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the Société générale has also affirmed yesterday that is preparing the commercialization of an offering that permit its clients to pay without contact through its mobile one. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Of the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris worries about the links among al-qaeda in the Maghreb Islamic and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The links among the group terrorist al-qaeda in the Maghreb Islamic (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, on the ones that he suspected themselves since time ago, they have been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> Sunday, the algerian vice Minister of Exterior Matters, Abdelkader Messahel, even affirmed that Algiers already &quot;has the certainty&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that they are cooperating&quot;, explained, without contributing more details. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to arrive at a similar conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation on the abduction of two French in Niger the past January would have resumed the runways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> They abducted in a restaurant of Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine of Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with various of its abductors during an operation thrown by the French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the debris of the intervention, the Nigerian and French investigators discovered various telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The study of the calls carried out indicates toward various speakers based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers grasped especially the interest of the investigators: one conducts to a Nigerian one that remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a north city of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man that, supposedly, is close to Aqmi and to the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It is a matter of a progress, but without doubt we should wait for to possess more formal tests before speaking of operating cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But is possible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We know since years ago that the sect enjoys financial support and exterior intellectual and that each time is more active&quot;, affirms Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> These last months, you said &quot;supports&quot; had turned out increasingly more evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operating ways, that now they imply the utilization of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly more complex and of the same style that them used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, beginning by Washington, is since then pressuring to Abuya so that keep in mind the problems generated by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities, in fact, they carry time considering to the group as a community of worthy little visionaries of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A fast success </seg>
<seg id="2815"> It founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and to the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (that signifies, in hausa, &quot;the western education is a sin&quot;), incites to the establishment of an in the north Moslem Islamic emirate of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is living a fast success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It is politicized and requires a strict respect of the sharia, while their militants they are launched to the fight against the impious central government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> These last they are oriented in the first place to the churches, the bars, the administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were especially assets and they multiplied the attacks against the precincts. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The reaction of Abuya was, as is used to passing, generalized. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army attacked the city and 800 dead were registered. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Since then, the sect is radicalized and abandons its north feuds. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Them you passed Christmas time, claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another in Abuya. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, Boko Haram attacks again against Abuya, particularly against the general headquarters protected of the police, with a suicide bombing, the first one of this type. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first objective international. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, that would cover from Mauritania to Somalia passing by Nigeria, restless to all the specialists of the security. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram arises like a new threat in the center of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with the President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has notified him against Boko Haram and has affirmed that was willing &quot;to share all the information&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to the republican candidates to the Presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> In relation to China, with Iran and with the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simple-mindedness and lack of know-how. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis, ¿can negotiate a complex world with simple ideas or, even, simplistas? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Listening to the republican candidates for the presidential, the voters would be able to think that thus is. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> Since some days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates each time do more resounding statements and shortcuts in matter of foreign politics, traditionally a strong point of the republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> They extend the mottoes, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the aid to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the better candidate situated in the career toward the designation by the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to carry the Chinese before the OMC and to denounce them &quot;by handling of its currency&quot;, a key theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector toward Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> It gives equal if that implies the explosion of a trade war, affirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, old Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate that possesses a sophisticated vision of the foreign policy, almost drowns before an attitude that &quot;crushes&quot; the emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It has asked a dialogue sign, but constructive, with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, that remains stagnant in the depths of the polls, continues being inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> In the style of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If I leave chosen, I will stop to Iran&quot;, boasted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama leaves reelected, they will have the bomb&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> It promised likewise to enlarge the military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of to have failed with its obligations in relation to that associate. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The businessman Herman Cain, the second better candidate classified, sample in turn a shameful ignorance of such themes. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, it urged to counteract to the Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;tries to develop nuclear capacity&quot;, apparently ignoring the fact that Chinese already has the military atom since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texan Governor Rick Perry, that supports to Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, in turn, is willing to unfold the American army in Mexico to fight against the cartels of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The resource to the torture against the supposed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also it preconizan Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The differences are considerable with the republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan had also simple ideas and that won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> They recall that the own Obama was a fan and that had to loosen the piston in matter of fight against the terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist, with reason, in the failure of their ingenuous dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit of the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq and in their prevarications in Libya, and they labeled it of weak. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attacks do not turn out to be simple them. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population judges of a more well positive way the balance of national security of Obama, that to put an end to Bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> From Iraq, distrusts of the military interventions that generate a sinking. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And, arguing that does lack to reconstruct economically America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the more just impression of being. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new door of entrance of the Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The gas pipeline Nord Stream, that communicates directly Europe western with Russia passing for the Baltic bottom of the sea, already has itself placed in service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It should supply gas to satisfy the needs of thirty million homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian giant of the gas, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, included four Heads of state and of Government, they participated on the banks of the Baltic one, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime Minister François Fillon and their counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, they have rotated together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entrance of Russian gas in the network of Europe western. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new gas pipeline, each year 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas to Europe western through a first one will arrive had of 1,224 km that communicate the region of San Petersburgo with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second pipe should be concluded by the end of 2012 that will permit to supply a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is to say, sufficient to cover all the French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Besides, already it is spoken of the possibility to build a third pipe by the same one traveled through. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the finalización to time of this enormous work presents air of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Poland and the Baltic countries had opposed firmly to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> In fact, the Nord Stream is going to permit to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the terrestrial course by third parties countries (Poland and Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Of blow, these two countries lose something of its power: for them, will be more difficult to influence in Russia threatening to close him the access to the markets of Europe western. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> In the climactic point of the debate, Warsaw did not doubt in comparing the Nord Stream as a &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot;, in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is to say, if the theme is politically delicate. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Europe western, supporting the Russian project, has obtained a greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy, given that the project has generated a gap between the Europeans of the east and of the west. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has known, in so alone five years, to cause to succeed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the countries western rich, large consumers of gas and with some reserves each more limited time. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This gas pipeline constitutes a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organic form&quot;, confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the gas pipeline, showing up to what point the large contracts of the sector of the gas are as political as economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the extensive smiles in the faces of the executives of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, in the point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline also supposes a technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The underwater pipe is manufactured of steel covered of cement to protect it against the anchors of the ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It is supported in the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 m of depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Build it, was necessary to avoid fields of mines that date from World War Two. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;It was necessary to withdraw or to destroy about a hundred them, by precaution&quot;, indicates Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Likewise, turned out to be necessary to maximize the measures of protection of the fauna and the flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The pipe is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 towers Eiffel and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, neither by stations of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> It was predicted a platform of control in the water of Sweden, but the responsible for the project they renounced the same one upon seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to permit that a Russian state company be to established of permanent form in the sea set against their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of damage, we will interrupt the step of the gas in less than one minute&quot;, I need Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In case of leak, the gas of the gas pipeline will free, therefore, to the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But the builders consider little probable that a leak be produced, since have predicted junctures that, according to the forecasts, they will have a leak each 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by means of an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, that carries out exterior inspections, as well as by means of a device that circulates for the interior of the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> With the form of a pure one, is introduced in the interior of the pipe, that possesses a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> To its arrival, after three complete days of trip to a velocity of three meters by second, supplies precise data on possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas pipeline has been designed to function for fifty years without repair any type need. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> At the beginning is of 200 bars and, on the way out of 100 bars. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five businesses have united their forces to be able to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The business leader is Gazprom, that possesses the 51% of the participations. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> To her, united the Germans AND.ON and BASF (15.5% each one), as well as the Dutch one Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each one). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a common business, call Nord Stream, responsible for building and to exploit the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Has its headquarters in Zoug, Swiss, where the imposition turns out to be especially favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Later, Gazprom rented to said company, during a time limit of twenty-five renewable years, the totality of the gas transportation capacities. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;To Gazprom will pay him for the total capacity, independently of the quantity of gas that really himself transportation&quot;, I need Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried I finish in a 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in a 70% by means of bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total price of the work should reach 7,400 million euro for the two pipes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached the 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But the minority shareholders are sure that they will not surpass its investment, since Gazprom assumes in and of itself the risk of the expenses. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas pipeline emerges of the Baltic one in Lubmin, in a sandy coast planted of pines. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Some valves, with 4.5 meters of height, they form the door at the outset of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Some sensors exist that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas to the arrival, before be transfered to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas each hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> To total capacity, they will be three million for hour and in 2012, six million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a notebook of mark. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It created does half century by an Italian business, Moleskine wants to return to the people the flavor by the writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> Has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in light of a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notebook Moleskine is recognized easily, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its leaves of broken white color, as aged by the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Nevertheless, the notebooks Moleskine with the current aspect were born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The business Italian Way Way, based on Milan, decided at that time to launch to the market a design notes notebook, but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, by that then consultant of the business, took charge of the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook is inspired in an old technique of production, the mass skin (skin of mole), that refers to a cotton varnished that was utilized, among others things, to cover the stools. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of notebook very was valued by the writers and the travelers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has adapted to the current flavor an old object and forgot, an icon of the modernist artists to the 20th century&quot;, account Maria Sebregondi, that since then became head of the mark in Way Way. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> And it reached the success. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26%, until reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Far away it has remained the confidential production of the first years, in which alone 3,000 notebooks were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It turns out to be difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook of notes attracts so much businessmen as to students and professional. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Just like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, of cultured and open spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian business, that included twelve workers in its starts, now possesses near 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: an in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, since the Fnac to the small commerce of the center of the cities, and has known to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have adapted to the times and to the need to write, in spite of the boom of the e-mails&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural firm goes of the hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has launched the exposition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects or artists expose its own notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, launched likewise a notebook with covers of leopard, because of the film Festival of Locarno. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and this cultural breeze, Moleskine has known to diversify its products: bags, agendas, ballpoint pens, cases of computer... The mark covers an extensive range of backups. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that causes envy: in autumn of 2006, Way Way was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, being written thus a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate of the disabled workers continues being so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Around the 19% of the disabled people they are seeking an employment. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> In spite of a resolved public politics, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled people duplicates the average rate: a 19%, set against the 9% for the assembly of the population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;Not&quot;, it affirms Éric Blanchet, general director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progresses reached since fifteen years ago are considerable. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time, the unemployment rate was not two times but three higher times than the average. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;Nevertheless, still it remains a lot by doing&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It fits to mention that the unemployed disabled they continue being faced to numerous obstacles to agree to the employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They are used to having a more advanced age: the 37% has more than 50 years (a 17% of average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They possess a level of cualificación little high: the 80% has not finished the degree and, of the 2.3 million students in the higher education, so alone 10,000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the long-term unemployment is very extended among them: the 53% for the disabled, set against the 38% of average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> That is to say, numerous questions exist that complicate especially the return to the labor world and that &quot;they constitute the gist of the problem&quot;, indicates Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help the businesses to hire disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Those are the objective obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Besides, they exist those that itself they are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too much slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for it I Cited indicated that the polled directors have &quot;a level of know-how on the low disabilities&quot;, with an &quot;excessive representation of the people in wheelchair, deficient physical or intellectual&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result: the private enterprises with more than 20 workers are very far from the objective to hire a 6% of objective, disabled workers that noticed a law of... 1987. </seg>
