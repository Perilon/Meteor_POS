<seg id="21"> It says only that NATO air strikes drove from their point of view, a general from America, but Allah, whose size in each of the accursed intervention were celebrating. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Thus, when they are looking for in Libya winners, the West is not among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We attended the firefight, serve Islam and our politicians to get rid of the dictator in the person of political allies, without guaranteed a profit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya militarily neokupujeme. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thus the local there is no problem with the expulsion of &quot;crusaders.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> But they will be without the occupation of the oil company for a song Libyan black gold? </seg>

<seg id="77"> The menu obese child: Nesnídá and dinner sausages </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years has a problem with overweight, and 9 percent of school children is overweight and obese is 5 percent of children. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Obese children, most of them come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as demonstrated by the current survey. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Once again shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which grows, and designs, which is surrounded by. </seg>
<seg id="81"> The tables in obese children, for example, there are smoked by up to half of the more frequently than in the families of children with normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> French Fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with awareness-raising events with the name of the Obesity is not an accident more than 19 percent of obese. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families trudged forward also is unusual to play sports, which, of course, most of the families of today&apos;s schoolchildren - just 15 percent of the children answered that their parents at least once a week to find time for an active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> A survey of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and participated in it nearly 900 children of primary schools from all over the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second year of the Obesity Action is not a coincidence that supports the Universal health insurance and the company Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> So far, the project involved more than 12 thousand schoolchildren from 4 to 8 classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> The right diet and plenty of exercise in the family is one of the decisive factors, which causes dramatically increasing the number of children who are overweight or even obese. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of those surveyed, for example, said that her five times a day in the breakfast-lunch-dinner-lunch-dinner, which is one of the fundamental assumptions of proper nutrition,&quot; is one of the results of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast and evening sausage </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts warn that are essential for the healthy development, as well as the relative details, one of which is to be a regular time family breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic while at the same time, eats only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most families eat breakfast every alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst part was the finding that in one-tenth of households with nesnídá at all. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the foundation of the correct daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The questionnaire showed that obese children in families with more often consume unhealthy French Fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost everyone - regardless of weight - he drinks each day sweet lemonade (70 percent). </seg>
<seg id="98"> While regularly sports more than 40 percent of those surveyed children, however, in their parents, the result was less than half - 15 percent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Your diet reports </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey to the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build his own menu of options offered by their own tastes and his own opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years from the point of view of a healthy diet far from ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite meals is a lot of farinaceous, meaty and sweet dishes. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;What is alarming is especially great popularity of sweet soda,&quot; it says in the final report of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch as a main meal of pasta won just above the poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> But virtually all the children did not want pulses and low approval ratings and a lunch of fish and vegetable dishes. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Shift to the health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The survey also showed that children are willing to modify their eating habits, if they get the right information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the control group of participants in the survey who filled out a questionnaire after the end of the educational lectures Obesity is not a coincidence, it is in many cases a significant shift in preferences toward the principles of a healthy diet,&quot; says the results of the project. </seg>
<seg id="109"> It was a striking example for sweet soda, which began more children prefer plain water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children also much more frequently in the questionnaire zaškrtly poultry and fish as a main meal of the day and would reduce the sweet food and dumplings. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Makeup artist must also be a good psychologist, says the pros </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the opening section on how to teach stylists, I&apos;m a little bit complained that it was a lot in the early hours. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I had no idea what will follow. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures three professionals in the field, clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, is really &quot;crowded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we discussed with the director Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only kid), dressed as a woman who has a shapely figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And such is the overwhelming majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone has a short neck, someone&apos;s boyish figure without clear curves and some overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Makeup artist must know how optically soften his broad shoulders, neck or to extend the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We were given as tips, for both women like Jennifer Lopez, a bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, a figure much stress and, at the same time, a woman neobléknout too challenging. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, is the difference between the waist and hips that skirts or trousers really doesn&apos;t fit, then it pays to have made at least one such piece on peace. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly you won&apos;t regret it, because the perfect-fitting clothing is priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt to peace will feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, odstává at the waist, and the like. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The boyish figure he can afford to wear clothes with the frills, applications, embroidery or tucks. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Such information and types of characters is, of course, many, so I&apos;m glad I have all week to all of the information in his head to look into. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And, I&apos;m afraid that, due to the specified domestic task is enough. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the kurzistek, was assigned to a celebrity, which has come up with two outfity: Daytime and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We have to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and body type. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I&apos;ll be &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerrovou, perhaps you know it from the campaign of Victoria&apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In my mind I&apos;m jubilant, for me personally, certainly better than a Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please keep in mind hyperbole), or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must avoid outfits from magazines or search on the Internet and print and then graphically process. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, how is the result, he says, then expressed our personal style and ties to the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Think about the graphic page stylingu is important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Makeup artist, was dressed only physically, but also creates, for example, the so-called product pages in magazines (in particular the award, for example, trendy purses, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> He told us about makeup artist and designer Mario Mason. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But it up on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Makeup artist must have a general overview </seg>
<seg id="140"> Saturday&apos;s lecture loaded with information about the types of figures varied three guests from the field. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Makeup artist John Pokorny, fashion designer and fashion photographer Jakub Polanka Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and makeup artist would be able to take advantage of. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a makeup artist knows how to work with one piece of clothing in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability in this case is key. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So a trenchcoat (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) can be worn over jeans and a T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also put him on a naked body, put on your shoes and photographed as clothes. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just roll up their sleeves and collars, and now the whole look looks different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Play with it,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most of all I appreciate the following advice: &quot;You need to work perfectly to know the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then you can start to break,&quot; said Jim. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, it is clear, then, why are slinging all those lessons, what with the combined, for what, why, when and in fashion magazines sometimes we see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben again, I know that makeup artist must have prepared a lot more options clothes than it is to take pictures. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So in fashion story, which will have 10 pages (ten outfitů), I have to be ready to &quot;nastajlovat&quot; at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And that&apos;s a picture of the dress looks and works in combination with other pieces of sometimes quite different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With that, then we have to create outfitu count. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and style sometimes makes up half the success, we confirmed John Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna, who is not just a singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic&apos;s approach to the use of the services stylistů rather cold. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even familiar faces it sometimes considered unnecessary (just after that, something I can, that&apos;s how I look at it, it is subordinated). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone from us to create styling, then we have to assume that we are likely to dictate a different (smaller) size than it really is. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then there&apos;s than googlovat and collected, if the boulevard didn&apos;t write about the celebrity ztoustla / lost weight and the like. </seg>
<seg id="162"> John and Mario on Sunday asked us to the heart that stylistovi is not enough to navigate in fashion and to be able to put together outfits. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work, in particular, communicates with the people who dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> To be able to tell people, nepodbízet, stand up for his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If you want a manager to her protřídili wardrobe and supplement it on a nice pieces, so you can&apos;t throw the whole case and say, my God, this is terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You find at least a few things that pochválíte and recommend what to wear,&quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also showed us exactly what it must include the so-called &quot;placovka &apos;, or bag on the field. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It&apos;s the one you turn around his waist, and in possession of all the necessary paraphernalia. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, hair-pin or safety pins, there are also silonová thread (with her makeup artist helped by the photography products, such as handbags or hats), special klipsy, which we clip behind clothes, if it is more (a pin or other staple is not permitted, it would have destroyed the garment), or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> We just didn&apos;t listen, but also something practically athletic, we learned how to properly to be relined shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Also in the photo shoot in the studio, where there is a flat surface, would be the sole could harm, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we&apos;re stuck and plastered. </seg>
<seg id="173"> With a pair of scissors to shoes, we must not touch that happened to be damaging. </seg>
<seg id="174"> It is, therefore, need to really skill. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario please me when my creation without reservations said. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The skill is really is not my friend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is just a tiny fraction of what we have heard about the second a continuation of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I&apos;m getting more and more clear that to pursue stylingu on a professional level is really not a walk in the park, let them say what they want. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed: The Run to race across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally an easy ride, because of a series of quite unnecessary on sloppy mistakes amended in a routine morning trip to shift. </seg>
<seg id="182"> The ambition is to a large extent, managed to fill, but it&apos;s no good if no one apparently didn&apos;t want to do anything extra. </seg>
<seg id="183"> A new episode of &quot;The Run woke before the high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised that the age-old racing series of Need for Speed again will take a new direction and from hratelných ukázek seemed like a game, which would be in the genre of the action racing didn&apos;t have to be just a number. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also wondering how they inserted passages in which the hero gets out of the car and goes after his. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But, as in a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They are potentially decent arcade racing, but a whole pulls down several unnecessary mistakes, which will appear in a series of more or less for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So it was not a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You were inducted into the story, the main hero Jack has some problems of a personal nature and as a solution is participating in the illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Behind the wheel usednete on the West Coast in San Francisco and your job is to finish first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is fraught with some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty factories. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that each race here is on the other line, and the stage is set to different, sufficiently different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> A man so does not have a feeling that the game would have offered more of the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Moreover, some of the environment are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphics is in line with previous works for the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So it&apos;s no big deal. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snow-covered mountains are visually very pleasantly. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Plants are in addition, from time to time zpestřeny some unusual element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, přimotáte into a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> By contrast, in the mountains, you have to be careful that you nezasypala an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> In addition, they are quite well behind planted rather individual races. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There are only a few types, but it&apos;s enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> So while you&apos;re trying to pass the required number of rivals (essentially classic race), then you are driving time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then waiting for you to be duel with a single match. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It is still gets from time to time and the police, who all your efforts even further inconveniences. </seg>
<seg id="206"> New passages are out of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Rather, it is just such an interactive animations, when Jack majority before someone running and you must help him so that, in the right moments after the right buttons. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complex. </seg>
<seg id="209"> A surprise but that these passages in the game is much less than you might expect (specifically, perhaps even the only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> As a result, but it is a good thing, because this element has a chance to become a nuisance and in the context of the above, is just one of the elements of that game break. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model is following in the footsteps of previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that today is no longer something, but this is not to say that he was záporem. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you&apos;re looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But the combination of model akčněji pojatému racing suits still quite well, even though we were able to find a better in the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Thus far, all in perfect order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems are beginning to emerge after a time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the model driving is too fine is not a model of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="218"> We don&apos;t expect this type of game that counts the complex deformation and conflict, but when virtually no impact to any object, you have no idea how to maintain your car, then maybe it is not quite all right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typically in a cramped overtaking or passing cars in normal operation, sometimes you lick each other only slightly, but at other times in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild piruetách. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even straight to smithereens. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system that was not particularly restartů doesn&apos;t matter, but you rozladí reliably. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Restarty are resolved so that if the and charges or you go far beyond the track, the game throws you back to the last clue on the track. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But restartů in every race is available only five. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When it is yourself, you must race to start again from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So it is rather a device in case something goes wrong, than that you could absolutely rely on them. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, but not aim will not help solve it is up to the need to learn the section of the plant from memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Big an affliction of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some of the curve so, for example, is the need for a ride in a specific way, otherwise they just come. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Sometimes you meet on the ground &quot;civilian&quot; coaches always in the same configuration of whether you get there first, place fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> It sucks, especially in situations where you can see how protijedoucími match between two cars in front of you easily passes, whereas when you get there you are already in a position that is you have to detour or put the brakes on. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is one thing when you get to them, because it is a &quot;measured&quot; so that the situation there was always just in front of your nose. </seg>

<seg id="241"> You have to pay attention to a gas station on the roads, because that is where you can change the car, although in most cases will do what you do have. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>

<seg id="281"> The extent to which their motto &quot;clearly and openly on Europe&quot; takes seriously, she showed in the first part of the speech, when she was able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations so easy-to-read and clearly, that could have a number of speakers from the Faculty of Law, UK envy. </seg>

<seg id="285"> The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as the answer to the question: &quot;Who is that the European Union?&quot; To which I have a phone number to call? &quot;And, therefore, a significant step toward unification and greater legibility of EU policy on countries such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to prohibit the coarse little cheesemonger </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová pay and agenda, which the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future. </seg>

<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of an ambassador, &quot;really slow&quot; was not only the presidency but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is today. </seg>
<seg id="293"> In addition, still must be approved by a new seven-year budget of the Union, which is precisely because of the current economic situation far more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether the budget will be a lean and efficient, which the industry will be given priority, of which country will be supported by more and more, all of this is on the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador also reiterated its main slogans, which came to Brussels: &quot;Europe clearly.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> An innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If someone was looking for a word that most accurately expressed strategy for IBM, the closest would probably be &quot;the long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public is IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm perceived as a very contemporary, and yet since its establishment had passed a hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Basis of this long-term laid the first head of the firm, a visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He had his password that many of the world&apos;s problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think about. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His motto, &quot;Think!&quot; It happened by, around which unfolds the life of future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which in IBM was already in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was also the basis for Watson carefully cultivated corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us from IBM&apos;s long-term thinking of continuous movement toward the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years due to remain true to its core values, and he wasn&apos;t afraid everything else around him to change. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It allowed us to during our first centuries to transform technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that, in the second hundred that we can achieve even more, &quot;he said on the anniversary of the current company director Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Elaborate the system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson in the 1930s to care for their employees as an entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees paid vacation, insurance from an employer plus elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system to reward the best inventors, and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As advanced and IBM has long-term relationship with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company has been from the beginning of the genius in the extraction of talent - as one of the first global companies canceled any discrimination, so he could collect. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In accordance with the strategy of anti-discrimination is the current plan that Palmisano, head of IBM in the next year will surpass the woman - Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> In the IBM has been operating for thirty years, still holds the position, head of sales, marketing and strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years, doing so-called yams, on-line brainstormingy, of which there is a lot of future strategies and innovation. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is not surprising that the ideas is enough - in the company he works almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> On behalf of the institution with a good </seg>
<seg id="333"> The firm position in business is responsible for the company&apos;s strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning of the concept of the institution to IBM, rather than just technology companies,&quot; said Professor Economistu Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but the company, which helps to solve business problems for the use of technology,&quot; said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself, he says, is the difference between the market and the right to enter the market. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or &quot;Big Blue,&quot; as it is due to its logo in the United States familiarly dubbed - in a hundred years has grown into one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is apparently nejvšestrannější technology company, is developing the hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from servers in nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Holds most of the patents of all US technology firms and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its inventions belongs to an ATM, debit card, financial swap, a bar code or floppy. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year to become the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Look of forward </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations to hit tastes of customers and time - IBM, for example, a bet on its own operating system, os / 2, on-line service prodigy or computers IBM PCjr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If your business is built on the move forward, you can&apos;t emotionally focus on the past,&quot; poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problem to build their bases on many platforms - and if they don&apos;t work, so it is to leave. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to rival Microsoft, which in principle stands or falls on the operating system Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Forward-looking technology </seg>
<seg id="348"> Sales of IBM, the largest share of services, after about a fifth of the group&apos;s software and hardware. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Yet in 1990, with more than a half-share of the most powerful representative of hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM has sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of promising technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In the investment continues from 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM is acting in accordance with the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression also increased the volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis intact. </seg>
<seg id="354"> IBM&apos;s share price since the beginning of 2008 increased by rocket 120 percent, net profit the company continuously growing. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Corporate motto of IBM&apos;s change everything, not just their value. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Therefore, it can be expected that, even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant could make it. </seg>

<seg id="476"> &quot;The rotation for changing it was closing in on us and we couldn&apos;t resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had more to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="481"> The price of the tour operators have evolved since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> In 1989, in what was then Czechoslovakia was allowed only five state travel agency, Cedok, Sporturist, COM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel office at the time, sold in the vast majority of the only tours to countries of the socialist bloc, since travel west was very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists as they traveled on holiday to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Lake Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> The notable exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when she was able to travel to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslavian regime brought to the West and way of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia have subsequently been very limited. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely individually or in the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In the event that he wanted a citizen of Czechoslovakia individually travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed in this country &apos;letter of invitation, not otherwise be individual way possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The travel office at the time, as well as offering package tours to the West, but had to wait in line overnight with a blanket or have in the travel office &quot;good friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> Even so, however, was not out of the woods yet. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called foreign exchange commitment, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not granted &quot;politically unreliable people&quot; who so they could travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Československá currency is not freely convertible currency, without foreign exchange commitment so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the way to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> By far the most often, however, the Czechs vacationed in Germany, which was the result of a large number of cabins and cottages, which the Czechs to procure and this custom survives to this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Czechs travel so has experienced since 1989 a real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While in 1989 was a holiday in East Germany or Bulgaria to our peak, last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A huge paradox, who had already today we don&apos;t realize is that the most popular Croatia for us at the moment, it was not possible to 1989 to travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Now in the early 1990s following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short-term visits in Vienna, Austria or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> They couldn&apos;t get enough of the Czechoslovakians long trips to the West, everyone wanted to see at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="498"> In Paris, for example, tours of the Czechs were sleeping in parks in tents, as our revenue was allowed to pay a hotel or bed-and-breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of the Czechs travel in this time of vození its own food cans, sausages, etc., in order to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertible Czech crowns, thus our tourists can finally after many years of destítkách freely buy Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living, and with it the average salaries, however, rose, which ended around the year 1997 in another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to increased demand for travel beginning to travel agencies regularly since 1997 to prepare tours charter air services, which will air tours by the ability to contract volume discounts compared with the past incredibly cheap. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990s, the Czechs have already visa-free travel virtually all of the developed countries in the world, in addition to the US, which continue to facilitate our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when he was due to the strong demand from the Czech Republic dispatched the first direct charter flight to exotica, it was in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> From this year, so each year vylétávají with Czech tourists direct flights to warm distant lands, this year&apos;s winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic already within twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Visit exotic country currently has around 100 thousand Czechs per year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> 17 November 2008 canceled the US visas for Czech tourists and that our country has ranked among the most advanced countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 for the first time in the history of the Czechs also spent more than half their vacations abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The General Meeting is to find the President again but a stalemate </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months is the Czech football without a president and there is a risk that the successor Ivana Haška at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place Thursday in Nymburce. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral system will do. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without it, even begins to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Interest to lead the Czech football have Henry Rajchl, Miroslav pelt and Thomas Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned from office in June and in his departure has urged colleagues to unite and found a strong personality, which would lead football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> But in an era of after Haškovi football slipped back to the bickering between the two former Houses, unable to agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> It showed on September 16, when a new president should be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the general meeting of the National House in Prague in Smíchov went in vain, as negotiations remained blocked and it wasn&apos;t just the way the elections. </seg>
<seg id="519"> In fact, there has been a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - whether only statutory representatives, or even officials of the power of attorney. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendations of the Constitution for the state and the law, under which the representation on the basis of the mandate is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> But disputes still exists about the electoral code. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The situation did introduce too bright nor the Executive Committee, which was already on its negotiations, both ordinary and extraordinary, does not address the virtually nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Look at the possibility of elections changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: How to proceed in the 3rd round, in order to avoid the possibility of stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or find a different model,&quot; said one of the three vice-chairpersons FAČR Dusan Svoboda, who in the leadership of the Association represents professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round to win one of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which he campaigned. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is reportedly willing to go to the concession to win, the candidate who obtains a higher sum percent of votes in both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And Czech party is pushing for a condition that the winner must receive a percentage of the census at least a two-thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;But it would then seemed to sense the two previous rounds, it would be totally denied bicameral concept,&quot; the Freedom Party understands the objections of Moravia, according to which would be the best procedure neohýbat and to vote in accordance with the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Somewhat surprisingly, agrees with that Thomas Paclík, though, it is estimated that the statutes of the electoral procedure complies with all of the candidates most pelt. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I wish that voted for a maximum of under the statutes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;In order to babble nonsense as a substitute in the last general meeting,&quot; said the owner of the Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time in their statements and to define primarily against the pelt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelt remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In Nymburce according to him will be the new chairman of the unknown, and believes that the candidates will work constructively together in the future. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passion calms down any of today&apos;s procedure of the national team at the European Championship.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football is going to be a happy wave, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; says jablonecký Churchman, who is from the three largest experience in the management of football as a professional and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is more restrained. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very conflicted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It&apos;s not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts of to adapt to the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may cause that to stop the general meeting will occur again.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;However, I hope that common sense will prevail,&quot; he said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> The agreement of all parties have much time left. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some of the negotiations, was alleged to have taken place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the game will be football the generals not complete. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, inter alia, vice-chairman of Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, namely from Prague due to a technical malfunction left in the morning and looking for alternative option, as part of the Executive Committee to the scene to take retaliatory barážové. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Finally, maybe it will be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, which might arise allegedly on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Josef Dobeš would like to make riven party inside the strongest sports associations in the country to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game is a lot: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming general meeting of chairmen of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the Czech Republic in the sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes into battle on the President, because they don&apos;t see a suitable candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the boss of footballers Plzně Thomas Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor would have to battle for the top post office. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there was a good candidate, I&apos;m fighting for him, and I&apos;m not going into the elections.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation, I could not find anyone like that,&quot; he told ČTK Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="552"> In a duel with Miroslav Peltou and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to pelt, alleged champion of elections, tried to avoid in his way to the front of the FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that in the event of his victory would be in the role of the president lasted only until 2013, when it is on the agenda of the Annual General Meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In function would like to see the prospect of an experienced and a top manager, who is not connected with the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;With some of the people who would be eligible, I&apos;m talking about.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me, it was crazy, as some have said that, at this point, with the Czech football or don&apos;t want to identify.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Look, I would like to change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most of all, they now Paclíkovi bother Peltovo connection with the chairman of the Football Association President Romano Berbrem Regional Manager, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates to the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclíka is so unacceptable to pelt stood in the presidential position. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he won, so the zakonzervuje the state and nothing in football would not move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a businessman, it would not help football even more,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Faces that Peltovo name years ago came in the eavesdropping in the investigation of the corruption affair, from which, however, pelt went unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what kind of prestige would football Peltovo victory would bring.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And as we also looked into the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, but also with grace notes of his former statement that it would &quot;sell the Plzeň club, if the pelt became president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the event that would Paclík in Thursday&apos;s election triumph, he could have imagined but with Peltou future cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="566"> As well, as well as other candidate Rajchl, which supported Paclík before the September meeting, which ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (pelt) would be the first, for whom I&apos;d go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great ability.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine him to be as head of the team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But it would have been able to drive the association.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I also I don&apos;t stick your nose in where I can&apos;t do that,&quot; said Paclík, which in September attracted a lot of attention that he was behind the appeal committee arbitration at the head of the s Luďkem Macelou, which replaced the Dagmar Damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík argues that would take on the leadership of the Association of venture. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Refers to its ability to the proceedings of private companies, since last summer boss also Pilsen, who with his support in May celebrated premiérový the League triumph. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to be in the football environment something changed to contributed to a particular culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To limit the effects of certain interest groups that tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Board, which goes to the unsavoury situations,&quot; said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example to sparťanskému boss Daniel Křetínskému. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of the priorities would also be considered FAČR cement relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, would help with political leaders lobbied for it to get into the sport has received more money from gaming taxes. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key things that should be given to the new President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If there is a tax on gambling, as declared by political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but frankly they need to say where the money goes,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> As a burden now Paclík does not even his connection with the main Pilsen club, although he says that the President FAČR should be &quot;bipartisan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelt is associated with Jabloncem, with the Prague Rajchl Duklou. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It&apos;s not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But I don&apos;t see no point in transferring hypocritical for someone of his shares in the club and staged a year and a half to go back,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelt promised the new charter FAČR, which would eliminate the electoral stalemate </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the football association of one of the candidates for chairman Miroslav pelt promised that, if elected, committed to FAČR new statutes, which in the future would definitely avoid disputes over the electoral system. </seg>
<seg id="585"> Jablonecký functionary is ahead of Thursday&apos;s hearing in Nymburce optimist and believe that the pre-election fight significantly dampen any success tonight football team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Even before the September pelt is no longer an option he promised that the entertainment and getting the Treasury intends to concentrate if elected. </seg>
<seg id="587"> In the elections before the last general meeting decided to go at the last minute, and so he could use the two-month delay to defend their ideas about the management of football and introduced in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels of football for a long time and they expect that on Thursday, will be chairman of the unknown.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that it is high time that the association of anybody,&quot; says the man who has been associated primarily with jabloneckým club, but who worked for a number of years and in Sparta, the union&apos;s executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="590"> And, therefore, believes that he has enough experience to the Czech football drive. </seg>
<seg id="591"> It is convinced that the current problems with the election of the euphoria which prevailed at the time of the reign of Ivan Haška. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, at the June general meeting approved the charter, which were not as perfect as everybody thought.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If they did different interpretations, President, we have had since September,&quot; said pelt. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Just the most important document of the Civil Associations, founded as a decoy delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I become president, I will take it as a personal challenge, and I&apos;m willing to give a personal responsibility, if this fails.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot be,&quot; says pelt. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Further, he says, trying to nevymezovat against its rivals. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Earlier announced that it can imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchlem, which recognises because of his právnickému education, and he knows that his opponent was his first vice-chairman. </seg>
<seg id="599"> For a long time, not attacking or at Thomas Paclíka, which on the contrary to pelt left the thread of dry. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;In football is a little over a year, has had some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were, however, undignified manner in the election campaign and a lot of people by surprise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;And so many of them now has doubts about his true nature,&quot; he said in the address of an opponent pelt, who says he remains faithful proclamations, which was announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions after representation. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be the showcase of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;And I would also tried to put an end to all of the affair from the bill Bohemians or echoes of last year&apos;s corruption scandal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Then I turned to negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure enough money for the whole of football,&quot; he told ČTK forty-six candidate two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> He had also promised that his arrival at the head of the football would not mean any personnel purges. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I would have to meet first with a filling of individual employees,&quot; he said at the Strahov, where the long interregnum is understandable nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the current disaster scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming meeting, believes that on Thursday they would pass the delegates to Nymburk unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point of contention is how to vote in the third round, so we are able to pass through it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility, and that will only by their leader will finally have again,&quot; remains pelt two days before possibly decisive on the day of his funkcionářské career optimist. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that under him would FAČR began to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic in Thursday&apos;s general meeting elected former Vice-President Henry Rajchl, many people in the association said it would be pleased. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Indeed, Rajchl promises that, in the event of his election begins to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to push through changes to the system and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the football field. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Also promised to resolve the case Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football and bring in more money to continue the work that began the previous chairman Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As chairman, I would like to address the football as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over representation, professional football, football performance for young people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;But this is not to say that I would do everything alone,&quot; he said in an interview with Rajchl ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I&apos;m a team player and I want in the Executive Committee to distribute responsibilities so that each of the members of a certain area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I&apos;ll be handing out hard tasks in this segment to move the football on a quantum leap forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;Many people would probably not happy, because it started to work really hard and not just to criticize the work of others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement said he thought that it would not stand again. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;For me to know that I&apos;m doing 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know that it will make sense and that I have people who I will always throw a spanner in the works and to question my every step,&quot; explained why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people told me that I must not give up, because then it would have given up and others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is the confidence that I can&apos;t just throw away,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> What motivates him and the continuation of the work that began with Haškem. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;In the two years, he&apos;s done a great job and I don&apos;t want to throw away now.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;They are running processes, which will have a lingering after a couple of years, and I don&apos;t want to be stopped,&quot; he said with concern that, if elected, another candidate Miroslava Pelty, said the situation in the Union could return to the pre-Haškem. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in a systematic approach, and that is something that I think Mirek pelt can&apos;t.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;For him are mainly navázáni people who would do football so that he would be only for those chosen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not to shrink from someone.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="639"> &quot;There is, so the current situation, where they are in the league only three Moravian units, which is a problem in the direction of the young players in Moravia,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Since the fighting involved the President and Chief of the Pilsen club Thomas Paclík, dares to Rajchl estimate their chances in the election. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;But still I feel strong support in the Czech Association, which I chose as his vice-chairman and sees that for me is the clear successes,&quot; said Rajchl, who for their achievements is saving tens of millions of crowns on onerous contracts negotiated television contracts and negotiations on loterijním law. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the contrary, it gives for complicity that the association does not pull in the same direction. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While the pelt declares that it is &quot;disqualified from returning to the Czech football confidence,&quot; the other contender Paclíka is considered a strong candidate, which has a lot to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can dispute that, in Pilsen in the year has done a great job.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;If elected, I would have continued in those cases that have started the Ivan Hašek and would not fundamentally change staffing in the boards.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="651"> The book shows, where&apos;s wellness in water, the most beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder made in the past one and a half year to breakthrough way, not in her luggage missing: Her bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Lying on his back on the water, looking up into the air in artistic set domes, swam across the marble putti (the figures of a naked boy, the child (with wings)), waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired carefully mounted an Art Nouveau swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="654"> If some of her swimming bath, in an integrated it into his notebook - even with remarkable details about how the building and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 swimming has examined in this way, a historian of architecture Meder and represents is now in its just released book &quot;Badefreuden (Joy of bathing)&quot;: The People&apos;s swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace swimming in Schwarzwaldu, &quot;Hard Core concrete buildings&quot; in Taunusu. </seg>

<seg id="657"> The 46-year-old German is a real entuziastkou plovárenské culture. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The sport wasn&apos;t overdoing it, says Meder - just in the water, it&apos;s something else. </seg>
<seg id="659"> The anger is just that fans swimming must make do with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the runners for health can be inhaled the fragrance of the spruce forests or listen to the Jolly Twitter of birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so ugly,&quot; says Mrs Meder living in Vienna. </seg>

<seg id="665"> &quot;It is both transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> Everything is optically duplicates: High arch, colorful tiles, skokanská boards. </seg>

<seg id="675"> Many of the thermal baths are the smell of sulfur, at the spa Árpád in Hungarian Békescsabě it smells of fuel oil to the extent that hard to believe that he was in the medical spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the medicinal waters with the content of alkali bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin, as soon as the only man he slips into the pool - a special experience wellness. </seg>
<seg id="677"> But also one place was Iris Meder in his quest for nice spa disappointed: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and spas Luhačovice, hit a closed terrain. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The year 1902 architect Dušan Jurkovičem proposed bath were concluded in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="679"> When Mrs. Meder looked collapsing windows of the red-and-white-and-yellow Art Nouveau buildings, saw a powerfully growing weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> By contrast, is being built in a swimming pool in Schwarzwaldu: In the Palais thermal in Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> These spas are already over three phases of construction; you can explore not only novorománské elements that come from the time of its creation in 1844, but also in the style of the Alhambra Moorish hall, which was added around 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> After the close the modernisation of 1995&apos;s Palais thermal popular spa pools Mrs Iris Meder take place, and not only because of Schwarzwaldu comes. </seg>

<seg id="694"> It is the result of the Forsa survey of consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report which Foodwatch has presented in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It shows the author Harald Schumann, that the stakes in the global commodity exchanges is driving the price up and banks are therefore complicit in the problem of world hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> Consumer activists campaign is directed specifically against the Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermannovi, though also velkobanky like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in much the same way. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Commodity bets were originally intended to traders to insure against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> In the meantime, but most experts agree that the participants in the capital market with an interest in high-risk trades are disengaged from the supply and demand - and on behalf of the poorest achieve profits. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Other than competitors in the United States responded to the criticism Ackermann: He promised that the criticisms are examined, and said that the deal &quot;is not worth it, so that was a good reputation of Deutsche Bank might be in jeopardy.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="724"> The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion at the World Expo in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and zpustnul. </seg>
<seg id="725"> It is now otvírán again as a ranch house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> When he&apos;s fanatic for modern postwar architecture, for obvious forms, glass hall, bold strokes and new construction materials, which are typical of faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World&apos;s Fair 1958 concise and noted for example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Received Schwanzerův pavilion at the Grand Prix d &apos;Architecture for his mild and vznosně operating structure of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> Still the construction is seen as a milestone of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Famous architect, also for the next World Expo built a pavilion of Austria. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary čtyřválcovým BMW-palace plus as key carried out by-building in Munich, 1973 internationally famous. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His as a temporary exhibition building designed pavilion after the World&apos;s Fair was placed in the Schweizer Garten in Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), rebuilt and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - was named as &quot;The House of the 20th century.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="732"> But it was not appropriate for the museum building, neither the space nor technically - lacked the walls for hanging art exhibits, no satisfactory climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Yet it was used until the contemporary art any new stall in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001, the building was empty and one of the best ever more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion reconstructed, now has a name of &quot;The House of the 21st century&quot; and will in the future be used as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> In Tuesday night&apos;s Belvedere Museum opens, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - happy intention in every respect. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Setting up a new beginning, Agnes Husslein-Arco, which 2007 became the new head of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, promovaná an art historian with a distinguished career, M. S. figure skater in his youth, later at Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, pushed strongly reconstruction for politicians and preservationists, sought public funds and private sponsorship money and identified the recovery. </seg>
<seg id="739"> In addition to the contemporary art should be displayed works by sculptor Fritz Wotruby foundations, should there be a cafe and a bookstore, and had to be built to the office building. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, low-budget. </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the implementation was then Krischanitz ideal coverage. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only that, sensitively reconstructed and extend the Art Nouveau buildings Joseph Olbricha in Vienna and won the competition, but because, in Schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him &quot;an extremely important place&quot; in which &quot;almost every weekend&quot; at the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original project and also about the problems of the building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change of use of the lost on their generosity and lightness. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reconstruction were far bigger problems: The building was &quot;catapult for energy,&quot; says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Profiles of window glass facades have been exchanged, used glass fibre reinforced with insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Chladové bridges-steel beams were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos completed ceilings rescued. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two underground floors provide space for new uses, recessed lighting channel between the building and the street carrying a lighting, leading to the entrance of the bridge - almost novostavba, but still lift Schwanzerův pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original entrance doors were maintained, the building is painted in the old had come out of the anticorrosion reddish color tone. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the screen is even more exactly the same as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all of this under the close supervision of the landmark office and a low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;I often had to be found material, which is good and cheap and also liked památkovému office,&quot; says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, the problems and the reconstruction of the building remained flexible and airy. </seg>
<seg id="753"> He said it was difficult with the pavilion, &quot;who came here from Brussels,&quot; he said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City-history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such architecture says he is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;give the appropriate self-confidence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, but not the House of the 21st century to improper place, as happened urban happy coincidence: In a radius of around Schweizer Garten is quite a newly designed &quot;City neighborhood near the railway station &apos;s office and residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: The house of the 21st century could receive support from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how it is to hear, it is with the city on the neighborhood on station in Schweizer Garten. </seg>

<seg id="837"> Also of note &apos;Hürriyet &quot;for Germany won&apos;t take to transpose this mental concentration. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &quot;It&apos;s starting to smell,&quot; reads the caption post from Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It points out that they were murdered people who paid their taxes and his work brought an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Nejkritičtěji is discussed in internet forums německotureckých the police and her late success in the search. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why didn&apos;t the German authorities had much earlier to search for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, he wonders authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> So many shows at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: &quot;If there will continue to be carried out activities so superficially, there won&apos;t be any immigrants anything other than their own defense and armed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &quot;It is perhaps the best self-defense.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="844"> &quot;On the quality and adequacy of clarification of an entire network depends strongly inner peace in Germany,&quot; he writes &quot;Selen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="845"> What does it mean if it is internal peace in Germany threatened, clarify the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="846"> Photos of the burning in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of Germans and Turks. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Since no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans, distrust and distance may result in right-wing violence </seg>
<seg id="848"> But the bombings have made on the part of the Turks more evident sense of reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="849"> To repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press was particularly criticized the failure of German policy following the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to those in Mölln survivors, to visit. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the arson attack in Solingen sent a telegram of condolence to a Turkish president, but at a festival in Cologne represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Kinkelem - in his speech, he calculated what charges the Turks surrendered. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Quite so, as if the value of a man at the height of his taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust many German Turks in the local polities. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of the extensive clarification and a new evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany this time requires open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal in Lake Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> Nejdobrodružnější Bank of Europe does not have headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost bankrupt and since then, sliding from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it has a German match. </seg>
<seg id="859"> So it certainly didn&apos;t think Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his noisy departure from the head of the leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July known, said that by 2013, almost as spektakulárního new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative career move. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said the friendly remarks towards future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;Die UBS reached a turnover.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September, it was clear that everything will turn out differently. </seg>
<seg id="865"> One dealer from UBS in London around all the security systems of banks and approximately 1.7 billion euros have wasted. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The board of directors of UBS, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The president of the board of UBS&apos;s since then also stunned - and they are asking: When he finally does Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> It became known that Weber Bank from February 2012 may advise. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And will take over the chairmanship in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday said. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber as it will be hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, a professor of economics and emission banker and he would have time to translate the needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Then suddenly takes over responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which was once again proved that deserves the title of &quot;The Bank of the largest scandals in Europe&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> As UBS is a giant - until recently, was the largest asset manager in the world - and sliding both for years from one scandal to another. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, will not remain proud Swiss Bank spared. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> In 2007, UBS has enjoyed an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the silent and a solid, but also a cunning trustee combines with the ambitious objectives: I also mean something in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So was managed by UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars of wealthy clients more money than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, came as the investment bank in the league of the world&apos;s largest banks </seg>
<seg id="880"> Made an impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> A former banker and a longtime professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger says: &quot;To my students, I always UBS cited as a model of good banks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From today&apos;s perspective, one asks: How I could be so wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong considerably. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, for the first time it was clear that something had gone wrong in UBS properly. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the mid-year, the Board of Directors Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly boss, who was still seen as highly intelligent and also brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> In a few months later, knew why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The bank&apos;s investment division has wasted subprime-papers and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In order to defend it, recommending UBS capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> But found actually investors, however, such over which has recently had her nose: Opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so discreet that one does not know his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But it was only the first shock. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it had been handled. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to admit new billions in losses, President of the Management Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 was the second best-paid the Governing Board of Switzerland, has resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, there was a disaster: UBS was due to their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatorily convertible bonds, for which they could become a bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The Switzerland had been shaken - as noticed how is dramatic for a small country, as it has on its territory as big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all, he was a balance-sheet total of UBS 2007 more than five times larger than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again, we couldn&apos;t UBS to save,&quot; says banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> On the first disaster follows the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> For several months on it capitulated UBS in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release the data of the wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of the banks passed the tax. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she agreed with the payment of 780 million dollars - as the recovery of undue profits from these transactions including pokutové surcharges. </seg>
<seg id="901"> That UBS has more or less openly abetted the reduction of taxes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time, it lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: Halo discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After this scandal was no longer Swiss banking secrecy what previously. </seg>
<seg id="904"> There followed the resignation of the chief executive and president of the Management Board. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Money and the exodus of customers. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the bank lost in the course of a few months her credibility in both central business areas: In investment banking because of poor speculation and property management for helping to cut taxes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when it&apos;s calmed down a little, just as it was thought that UBS has regained her health, here comes this unfortunate business quest: The only dealer have wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it is clear: With risk management in the investment banking, it probably still wrong. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;The case is about Adoboli found that the risk control changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Finanz Bank Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also, the financial director of a large German bank is certain: &quot;The problem of UBS lies in the fact that fail to control the risks.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> It was exactly her idea of caution with which they Swiss bankers long ago, to become the world&apos;s major assets: None too much of a risk, but security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic collapsed again in the world. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol for an unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Reports UBS in Zurich is more suited to the cliché good Swiss private banks - is just a little bit more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Now the position is a classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Curyšskému lake, which is framed the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are beautiful, lettings business is among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewelry stores like Tiffany&apos;s here to find between the Swiss traditional stores such as ice cream parlor Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries it is Swiss banks: From the Nationalbank over Palast der Credit Suisse after an elite private banks like Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the reception hall UBS to enter the heavy revolving doors. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside are marble walls, they stood before the massive leather chairs, in addition to the big banks for &quot;safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the customer is looking for: Security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> The idea of the two Swiss velkobanky Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - repressed or betrayed how determined the boss of a small Swiss private banks. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name would be better not to read in the newspapers, finally concluded, like all Swiss bankers, also with both velkobankami shops. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS is probably too grown, notes, especially in investment banking, where he also expanded the Anglo-Saxons. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss, I do not have anything to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if there is, they&apos;ve adapted to the long Anglo-Saxon ways.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which UBS has changed, brought her first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution had not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> 15 October 2008 was a disaster evident. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;In the middle of a small coalition government decided seven countries on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros approved the politicians to rescue from bankruptcy, standing velkobanku. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If the talks with Swiss bankers, so you can see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, joined two of the three Swiss velkobank into a huge concern. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The bank was already on the merger was too big for the small Switzerland - and still further grew. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that the two different bank predecessor UBS complement each other: One rich, but sleepy Bank in Zurich with the centre of gravity in the management of the property and poorer, but internationally more involved. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly came internacionalizovaní investment bankers profitably for many money with which they could make a big roulette. </seg>
<seg id="937"> With the rise of UBS are linked two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the UBS and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Management Board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are the team of the future,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows many of the models and statistics and Ospel, you control the feelings around the stomach, who is from the bank of science has developed quite up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel is said to the end he relied on Wuffliho. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Wuffli and at the end of probably made crucial errors: &quot;I thought his models are a reality,&quot; says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> The tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: Pride was preceded by the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of UBS clearly remember the meetings of managers, a group which Wuffli chief repeated again and again the same password: Bring the Goldman Sachs down from the throne. </seg>
<seg id="946"> Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Alleged &apos;League Tables, &quot;waiting list, which documented the success of the banks that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> In her tried to UBS on the location of the very top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> A few steps she had succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In trading in foreign exchange and stock participated in the games at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Corporate advisers who were responsible, but underline one weakness: In the international swap trade, in the language of the bankers&apos; Fixed Income &apos;, I think there is a big gap for the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has about the gaps in US mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, determined to UBS to adventure, which almost cost her existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, as well as the bank itself invested her based fund to ensure the risks in the US subprime investments. </seg>
<seg id="955"> They developed into a machine that securities diaper on US mortgage loans and passed on - he left himself but also risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Still, when other banks have long sought a way out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought,&quot; says banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> How big&apos;s euphoria, so deep fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than had been thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Position at UBS have become katapultovacím seat, and to this day. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads velkobanku now has almost refractory work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He must find a strategy for the bank, which all close business models were gone. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Banking expert Geiger has had an idea: End with the investment banking, the concentration of the administration of the assets, a return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> So far the bank had completely (still) doesn&apos;t want to go. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But investment banking has severely cut, so it is now clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, the bank&apos;s new chief Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen not only as a transitional solution, when the bank surprisingly broke up with predecessor Grübelem. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, pushed through: He has a long-running the business UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti investment bank wants to give back to the state in the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> 3500 jobs strikes. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What he wants to make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that have already by Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="976"> But has not yet publicly says only that he and his first lady finds in Zurich apartment. </seg>

<seg id="995"> Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this view: Said in a CNBC-interview that probably is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything possible to end the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore, it is probably too soon from his point of view, to invest in European government loans or banks. </seg>

<seg id="1012"> Intelligent crows are expanding in cities </seg>
<seg id="1013"> In many places are seen Ravens field for &quot;distressed birds&quot;: But from cities had long been unable to this highly intelligent animals out, experts say. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> One is they like, others would like to get rid of them quickly enough: The crows are already for centuries in the image of the city, yet in some municipalities are accumulating residents&apos; complaints to the taste and noise caused by animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> It is not against the &quot;problem birds&quot; not yet in sight of a resource. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Ravens field probably cannot be from cities already out, said the experts at the first Symposium on Human crows in východofríském Leeru. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> There are consulting experts from around the federal territory on the possible considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> They are looking for alternatives in the cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Environmentalists claimed the problems of cities as well as from the exodus of specially protected ravens field: The use of chemicals in agriculture about increasingly destroying traditional areas for life. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Persecution, the growing encroachment and felling of trees to make life more difficult for nesting birds. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> The crows are protected. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are among other in Vestfálském Soestu, in the northwest, including in Jeveru, Diepholzu and Achimu in Bremen in Leeru. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> In 2005, the project of the mass killing crows in the rural district of negative headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics have described the capture of animals in traps for birds and baby sticks for a particularly brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;Normal expulsions, scare, does not add anything,&quot; so he found a landscape and urban planner Werner Klöver from Leeru. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Removing nests spraying water or the felling of trees has often adverse consequences, he said, also an expert on the environment Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;The animals are receding, a large colony is split and distributed to other places.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> It is conceivable for scaring as an exception for hospitals, nursing homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We have to live with them, it&apos;s gone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Without the surrounding territory cannot solve the problem of cities, was the view of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leeru. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It is conceivable combination of expulsions of animals from sensitive residential areas and their crowd in to settle in other places. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> &quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws&quot; promoted by contrast, psychologist and etnoložka Uta Maria Jurgens because of an entirely different treatment of animals: &quot;A pimple on his face at the end of the day, the best we can survive with confidence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Mrs. Jurgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherbergskou educational crow&apos;s path, which provide information boards lessons about life, highly intelligent raven field. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Meanwhile, the project is said to be already adopted the tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Also on the criticism of noise pollution from birds had Mrs. Jurgens own view: &quot;This is about every volume of communication, they have had much to say.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Ravens field not only used tools to achieve a treat, but even as a tool of his instrument maker. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Researchers from Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four havranech field, how far is the intelligence of the birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must bring about the collapse of the structure to get to the larva of the pier. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without much training know what size and shape of the stone must have to have caused the collapse of the platform. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In the second attempt had to clever crows then burdensome to solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a vertical cylinder researchers placed a small jar with the larva of the pier. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> Couldn&apos;t beaks of birds on their prey to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However, the researchers put them there pieces of wire. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> The four of them formed the animals of the hunting of the pipe as a container for handles. </seg>

<seg id="1292"> On the contrary, the British soldier is aware that in all likelihood will die soon, and no one will care, let alone to grieve. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;When you finally accept the sacrifice, he would have expected at least, that will happen before the eyes of a grateful audience,&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead, however, he seems like a &quot;man who secretly hanged.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other remarks relate to leave Old Europe and the advent of new horrors. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competition,&quot; says Mr Englund, &quot;the war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> He caught it, what he called &quot;a new kind of beast of impending century: Articulate and ideologically staunch serial killer in clothes tailored for peace that their bloodshed carried out without getting up from the table.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People were totally unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Mr. Englund describes as well as soldiers from prostitutes intentionally trying to catch a venereal disease, so as to avoid service at the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;Nejgrotesknějším example of this behavior was trading with gonokokovým pus that soldiers were purchasing and deter his genitals, in the hope that it will end up in the hospital,&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;The most desperate and rubbing it in the eye, which is often blinded to the end of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of Swedish from Peter Graves&apos;s prose of Mr Englunda swinging, but not spectacular, which is to his human subject admirably. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small outputs captures the way the war &quot;launched a totally uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are beginning to ask, why is their leaders to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about World War I mostly rather than with a complex story worked with signs such as &quot;the First World War and the modern memories&quot; from Paul Fussella or novels like &quot;The peace of the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarquea. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Mr. Englund prefers to unconventional concept. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book is the most devastating endings, which in the popular educational literature is unprecedented. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> However, it will not tell you. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> You will, however, seem as if suddenly jumped out of the author of the book, you tore a page from a list of heroes out of hand and ignited it. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After the previous mistake this time to the minute planned raid </seg>
<seg id="1311"> She participated in hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it at that time would be almost empty Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The action didn&apos;t know no one except for a few high-ranking officers. The other was first told that this was an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> At the forefront of the action was Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems in the operation of the police department had to face. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> May not be repeated cases in recent weeks, when, for example, the use of pepper spray against the demonstrators, thereby violating the department, and a wave of public sympathy flowed to the side of the squatters. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> That is why the police operation, the purpose of which was to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park, launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercises. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The leaders were inspired by the proběhnuvšími operations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> The massive exercise in case of behavior in crisis situations was carried out in parts of the Randalls Island, which was preparing to try in Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Leading players step up the so-called training for riot control, anti-terrorism measures, including a rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - with a focus on urban part of Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last part of the training took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> Orders to move into the park came literally &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said someone who was action originally explained only as a &quot;training exercise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;I know some of the policemen who were in this action also called upon, and certainly no one said that we are going to Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke only on condition that he remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;That&apos;s going to Zuccotti Park, known only to senior members of the department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One of the grounds of secrecy was a lesson of the city once had. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> 14 October had to clean up the city&apos;s leaders in the park, but then backed away from the plan, because as soon as they heard the protesters, herded them into the park before the start of the operation for hundreds of years. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Tuesday&apos;s action involved police officers from different units, including the battle groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers, who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly explained that during the day he comes and goes to the park, a large number of people, so one o&apos;clock at night was an ideal time to try to launch. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to do it at a time when it will be in the park as few people as possible,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Than units, the streets were lined up on the borders of Pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of the emergency units with arched lamps and loudspeakers. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and the roaring of the speakers scared many demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> When they entered the park by members of the security forces in their blue větrovkách, many protesters have packed their things and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Police say that up to 1: 45 in the morning, not a single tent, which the demonstrators wanted to give time to gather their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police officers were seen as the gathering at the edge of the park, so that they could enter into it, if it were needed to make any arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The reporters were forced to leave the park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne claimed that it was for their safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> Many journalists, however, is of the opinion that the police want them to stop to see its troops in action, and in addition to some of the police. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Brown argued that the television trucks on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could easily shoot. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The police moved west and wound through the dense tangle of personal belongings of protesters, including luggage and plastic bags filled with clothes. Behind them, teams from the health department, which immediately shrabovaly everything in the park was left. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some of the demonstrators, who refused to move, were dragged from the park. Documenting video materials for a moment later appeared on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> Most irreconcilable group of demonstrators took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which was near the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have created a roadblock and police launched their methodological arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> About ten people in the center of the camp is bound to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people were tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Up until 3: 30 in the morning in the park there was no arrests, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The whole operation was completed by about 75 minutes later, sounded expression of the police. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Brown said that in the park were detained around 142 people. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests took place on the grounds of &quot;organisation riots and resisting arrest,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> Senior police officer at the scene of the action was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Personally involved in the operation also Phil T. Pulaski, the commander of detectives in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr Kelly was present, but &quot;not involved in the management of the operation,&quot; said Mr Brown. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The second group of police officers waiting along the east side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case he was needed to have a need to call her. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the street Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block south of the park, were erected roadblocks. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> From these places, then a police moved even further from Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At one point they were seen police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, as crowds out the person even further behind this border. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> On the northern border was about 28 people. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> The actions the night took place just south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> About five o&apos;clock in the morning, he was spotted one demonstrator south of Pine Street, jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others who were pumping the air out of the tyres of a police van. </seg>

<seg id="1360"> At the end of the operation was hospitalized one police officer and one of the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The union auxiliary staff will sue the city because of the release of </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliary workers who lost their jobs last month, on Wednesday, they plan to sue the city, saying that the release was not necessary and it was a matter of discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on the school attended by the poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The lawsuit is likely to be the last option, which the unions in the District Council 37 left in their efforts to reverse the decision on layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> The 7th October lost work six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst-paid employees of the city. Their release leading union members have described the city as retaliation for last spring did not allow access to the health care fund managed the work crews, through which the city wanted to fill a hole in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The city&apos;s leaders this accusation categorically rejected. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At the meeting of the council, held last month, said Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> One of the council members immediately countered by saying that in the budget is not specifically discussed the release of the support staff. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Leaders of the urban parts of the District Council 37 announced that it has already completed the necessary documents and the Education Ministry warned that it will sue. On Wednesday they will hold a press conference formally notify the application to the state court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the claimant will be eight redundant workers, all of whom are afroameričany or Hispanic males, like most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city&apos;s legal department, said that the city had seen action, and therefore would not comment on specific allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, the unions have focused on a number of redundancies in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support his claims of an unfair negotiations. They hold the view that the poor schools have lost more assistants, because they are already being denied sufficient financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Island, admitting at all and in parts of Upper East Side minimally, in Brooklyn, in parts of the District 23 in Brownsville came on the work of the 17 school officials and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South bronx was released even 46 assistants. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Recalls that in school, Public School 36 in Harlem lost work five of the eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: &quot;It&apos;s not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the deficit in the budget.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the School of Public School 36 was reduced this year on 3,26 percent and the school also lost money when the city changed its method of calculating the reward of finance for each logged on a poor student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also argues that the directors of the secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written document authorising the release of parent coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> In the document was to describe the action used the word &quot;excess&quot; cancel position, although this was a word more often used to describe the movement of teachers on the payroll of school into a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released,&quot; says in a draft of the complaint, &quot;and not only moved into the database for the position of available workers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something that concerns the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Before that, however, she had a revolution to succeed, the long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States closed. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, it will be the Commission for international relations to the Senate to decide on the statement, which supports President John Kerry (Mass.), together with senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which should congratulate Libyans to their successful rebellion and US troops to thank for &quot;courage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This declaration we want to pay tribute to the courage of the people of Libya, who began with the conversion of their country,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The sentence they may look innocent, but no debate on the Libya, so far has not been easy. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> During the summer, lawmakers from both parties are constantly arguing among themselves and with the White House on the text of a statement for approval or rejection of the United States&apos; military role in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorising limited the use of US armed forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The proposal was rejected in the House because of differing views of both political parties, so that there is never in the Senate vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> However, the same day, when he was in the House rejected this proposal, the House rejected a measure that would have stopped funding for U.S. operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The US mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress has criticised the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members that obviously nedráždilo enough to stop supporting him in his actions. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The reluctance of Congress finally has been overtaken by other events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> In August, the rebels captured Tripoli and 20 October was killed by Gaddafi. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The mission of Nato officially ended October 31. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> It is now the Senate might be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Commission on International Relations in its statement &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and remarkable resilience, which invested in an effort to free his people&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who participated in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The statement also &quot;confirms the national interest of the United States on the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new proposal will get the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or legislators again will be divided into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June draft? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version of the stand against Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief representative of the Republican Party in the commission. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugarův spokesman on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has yet seen. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> In the House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or any other topic, which will vote in the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers, meanwhile, despite considerable efforts have failed to their proposals through to the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattův proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were introduced in Congress and touching a wide range of different topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted by the House and the Senate - and others are only minor modifications of other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the amendment on the balanced budget and another handful who would like to &quot;regulate federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially beginning with Republicans, who want to improve the reputation - can boast of their &quot;ownership for.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require the appendix on a balanced budget vote, the House and the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favor of the non-binding declaration to support the creation of such an appendix. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> In addition to the budget he wants to hear several members, as well as restrictions on the number of the period in which members of Congress could serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a series of amendments that would, among other things, guaranteeing the right to quality education and medical care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The permanent proposal remains an amendment banning same-sex marriage, an amendment to ban the burning of national flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws in the case against them will stand up to two-thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Although it appears that members of Congress in designing various additions very active, compared to previous years, however, not significantly exceeding the average. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In 111. Congress offered 77 amendments, while in the 100. Congress was 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Their activity even pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s, according to the statistics, when the Senate library members offered every two years, more than 150 amendments. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they were not much more successful than the current politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment, which was added - 27 supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was designed by Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Beat up, but not defeated,&quot; says Giffordová in his first television interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after her from the immediate vicinity of the wounded gunman at a public meeting with constituents in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Ariz.) in the Monday night appeared on national television, she sang together with tunes from the Broadway show &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said that more than a return to Congress stands on it to health. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> Giffords appeared in an episode of &quot;20 / 20&quot; on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was evident that the formation of sentences still doing her problems and he needed help. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary because of injuries caused by a bullet that came through the front of her skull, penetrated the left half of the brain and at the back of her head came out. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, surprisingly returned to the House, to triumphantly took part in the vote on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others were wounded, Giffords smiling, laughing and singing - with his recovery, described as &quot;difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked how she felt, Giffords jednačtyřicetiletá replied: &quot;Quite well.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Giffordsovou and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special episode on &quot;20 / 20,&quot; which was broadcast on the eve of the release of a new book of this couple, titled &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special watched the entire convalescence Giffordové from gunfire from January 8. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> The videos, which turned Kelly during the first week, is to see Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> While her husband is encouraging, can at that time, more than just pick up one or two fingers. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Giffords captured, sitting in a wheelchair and therapists taught her how to perform simple activities. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> Head pokývání. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Lips Vyšpulení.. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, her first word: &quot;What.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> Within a few days, Giffords said another word - &quot;toast&quot; when demanded changes in their breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Video odvysílaná station ABC show that a central role for recovery Giffordsové played music: Congresswoman on them singing along with the therapist to melodies to the songs of &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; from Cyndi Lauperové and &quot;Free Fallin &apos;&quot; from Tom petty. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> During the interview Giffordová, which devotes two hours daily therapy, Sawyer said that from the day when the shooting occurred, he can&apos;t remember anything. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that Giffordové read newspaper articles on the shooting until March 12, when he first asked who she was six, who was killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The shooting of a suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missoury, where under the influence of forcibly administered drugs awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;A lot of people have died,&quot; she said Giffords Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Terrible, terrible, terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife during his convalescence, she said: &quot;I lost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So I just said: Gabby, neprohrálas,&quot; Popisoval Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> &quot;You just got beat up. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> But you can do it, you put it together and come back even stronger than ever before. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Military units are to meet with compassion rather than with respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was galavečerem on Wall Street that made millions of dollars for the war veterans in New York, who do not have a roof over his head. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> The kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Clustered around him, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Solemnly dressed the crowd stood and applauded enthusiastically. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women serving in the army were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who hosted a lunch of spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> The gala evening, attended, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition to him on the spot, and Admiral Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of military units somewhat differently. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;All of them have been presented as some orphans,&quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers thought well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that yes. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But what I saw was not respect. It was a pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So completely the opposite impression only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The army is bezbřeze included praise for his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But this praise for something, they say the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly behaving as if individuals in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all the victims,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon leave. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way they can support some of us, is to put us into the role of the unfortunate souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This issue is very sensitive for the military commanders who do not want to appear ungrateful or spoil relations with the public, which serves. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also recognize that anger, which once had to face the troops returning from Vietnam, was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> The result is that most of the words of regret is spoken in silence and in private between war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> When the two sons retired Colonel Mark Cancian returning from combat missions, where they served as a member of the Marine Corps, warned their father at their service will be people outside an army watch from two angles. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> From the point of view of some will feel the respect and awe, because the defeated enemy insurgents and visit exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> But others will wonder if &quot;beneath the surface doesn&apos;t mean, a veteran of violence,&quot; said Cancian, who was involved in the fighting in Iraq and after the return took place in Washington in the government. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> He claimed that when looking for work, so some people who were doing interviews with him, subtly suggested that so soon after the return to the fight can withstand the stress, which is associated with the work in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative reactions,&quot; said Cancian their sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Army part of the concern stems from the American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The successes on the battlefield rarely get the recognition in a country that has its own army and little awareness in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are just a few of their own benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation already value of military heroism, as was the case during the Second World War,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public will focus mainly on the suffering of the men under arms. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The soldiers are vyznamenáváni a number of actions, which endured, the many friends who have lost, or the extent of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army is facing growing pressure to crack down on rapes </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week to decide whether to begin the process of 28 men and women against the Army for alleged inaction in the case of rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, they are prepared to bring the action hundreds of other applicants. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Private First Class Elizabeth Lymanové was at night, when she was allegedly raped by his colleague from the army, 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend on her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her if it can connect that with her in the room might have a little drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;In my mind the warning light came on,&quot; described Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But a native Texan her objections completely ignored. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: No, no, he&apos;s 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is from Texas,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wish I listened to their instincts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the army to wait for the verdict hearing, which could have a historic impact. It will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and goes about whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald may fail, he gets up before the court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> In the indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The accusation was made in February, a Washington lawyer Susan Burkeovou and plaintiff at that time was 17 members. During the coming months, however, their numbers swelled to 28-25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army, and that army after the publication of these and failed in the investigation and punishment of any pursuit of justice. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says that going after a senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts right at them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is direktivním system,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people who are in the position that they can prevent an attempt on the introduction of measures against such acts? High command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also alleges that from February contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of which of them could become part of the other lawsuits filed in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Her strategy: Rather than regrouping to all of the charges in this case - packed all the eggs in one basket, as she says - a claim in several different cases, if need be, pressure to subside. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The Ministry of Defence is leading a team of the United States Attorney Neil MacBride, who together with his colleagues gave impetus to the dismissal of the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Court documents obtained by Newsweek, examined in detail the defense strategy -- in essence, the current or former army soldiers cannot sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to the regulation of the Supreme Court of 1950 Feres Doctrine called as the federal government is not responsible for the injuries, which will suffer the soldiers on active duty. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged injury concern the military service of the plaintiffs,&quot; the document says. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Ministry of Defense has refused to comment on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> , however, things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Although women still officially may not serve in combat, it&apos;s just a quibble: In modern wars can be hard to find a clear front lines. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: Between those wars fell 150 soldiers of the female sex - two-thirds of them directly in the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> The time has come to modernize and in the army, explains Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> In their struggle is not alone. In addition to her are dealing with the case three other legal representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> Yale law school to prepare visitors veteran radical tour seminars on legal services action on four key military academy for alleged developing atmosphere that hatred for women. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Regardless of a non-profit organization of American Vietnam veterans gathering evidence for its action aimed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis &quot;personality disorder,&quot; which was allegedly found in the victim of rape, that the Army was an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as Ana Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women&apos;s Action Network, this is a perfectly normal practice. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> In December, the group has filed suit against the organisation for negotiations with the veterans, which he accuses of discriminatory practices, which should take place in the processing of applications for assistance from people who said they were sexually attacked in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> It was presented in Congress nine separate proposals, which was presented by a group of senators and representatives from both political parties and proposed in them a whole series of corrective measures. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence of the Ministry of Defence was reported in 2010 3 158 sexual assaults. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> This type of attacks, however, remain in the majority of cases, unannounced and according to its own estimates, the Pentagon this number represents approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents, which occurred in a given year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> In a report issued in March is dismantled and intensity of the criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010 to receive 20 percent of cases reported in the army - which is half compared with the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Prosecutors in the case of deputy Burkeové described the attacks as just the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Private First Class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after what should happen to him. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> During the night, he says, was asked to details about his rape repeated 11 times various members of the police, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Had all the necessary tests to determine the rape and blood was found in her bed attacker - from the wound, which made him on his arm. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, graduated from Lymanová hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether it is on the day of the attack in love with his friend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It was předvoláno six persons as witnesses spoke in favour of the reputation of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the judgment was handed down,&quot; says Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I had a feeling that right there on the spot with a screaming baby - I ran out of the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I was in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember his commanding officer said: It wasn&apos;t his court. He was mine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lymanové ordered to attend a military psychiatrist, who diagnosed with her personality disorder, which it described as unfit for duty. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 were from the army without honor, and thus not eligible for long-released. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whatever the case Lymanové and other prosecutors move on to the next phase or not, it&apos;s a marathon, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> But, observes, &quot;From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the other phases of the hearing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Between them and the verdict, however, is the doctrine, which has come under fire from the moment she saw the light of day. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because of their obligations to adhere to the same level indicates the motivational incentives and dissuasive means. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The change will occur only when good people willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If it is not within the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the plaintiffs&apos; lawyer, collected hundreds of other people prepared to take legal action and will begin to work on other cases relating to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will continue with the army to fight on this issue, where there is no reform,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whichever came first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: How you scientists examined on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man, who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> In Monday&apos;s Braivik, who confessed to červencovému known homicidal rage, after which left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Despite Breivik could act on its own, in cyberspace, certainly not alone: During the preparation of the attack had spent a lot of time at the computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists in support of the right-wing groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easily - just to go on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realized that we get is, it&apos;s not all that difficult,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report of the British research team, which involved the European digital populism. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett that scientists was enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site and thanks to determine with precision the demographic group - something that Public Relations people have been doing for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlett&apos;s team across Europe found half a million supporters of the right-wing groups, and focused attention on them and sent them ads. However, instead of through the newly created group or invited by offering them a diet products, urged them to fill out a questionnaire in which there were questions about their level of education, the violence and optimism due to their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;This is a completely new way of conducting research,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not all that surprising: On-line supporters of the right-wing groups are mostly young men that riles the rising rate of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But on the other hand, &quot;those who its online activism are combined with off-line activism are more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work of the team demos is just one example of how Facebook has become a new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers are using these sites to study everything from health problems after social trends hiding updates happen, contributions to the walls and tight buttons &quot;I like.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Facebook says more than 800 million active users. Each of them a day on average will provide three different data, which from the social network&apos;s literally &quot;information supernova,&quot; which stands for the development of many of the new research. The number of academic works, in whose name is the word Facebook has increased compared with five years ago to nearly 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some scientists is the magic of Facebook, in that it gives them the opportunity to study the people without having to bother them somewhere on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Previously, if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You have to get into the party, where would you but would never allow this,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;All this Facebook degrades - you just go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio-health problem and avoid them. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moreno at the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that the university students, who were dismantling their drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggests that peers students sites monitored and come up with an offer to help the student, who publishes too many drunken status. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;The problem cannot be resolved, if it can&apos;t diagnose,&quot; he told The Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Dr. Moreno, director of the Center for Health, behavior and the development of the children at the Children&apos;s Research Institute in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not have had a chance to discover.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook itself constantly probed the date of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> A team of pages of information developed statistics on the connection relational statuses and on St. Valentine&apos;s Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the satisfaction of the people (mainly using the information to which they had access - defenders of Internet freedom have long claimed that the site had a treasure of information available for research and others). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that the page is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play scrabble with a friend, which is thousands of miles away, is the need to provide their personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if Facebook users will become part of the research, which they don&apos;t even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect the data off-line. The on-line data, however, are accessible to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I think most users thought that scientists could look into their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, which he performed with the use of public Facebook walls of their students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as he was concerned, they took it so that the information is only between them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Subsequently, it is also to consider the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even in the research off-line, there is no guarantee that the organisation is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Facebook is no way to verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions to the wall of the true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What do you say to Facebook and what you are doing outside of Facebook, these are two completely different things,&quot; explains the Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why you Selwin, who spent long years to research new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool that can be used in research. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;When you go into the real world and you&apos;re talking about real people, it&apos;s something that can&apos;t be replaced,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research should be on society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off-line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;The cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring Breivik is taking part in his first public court hearing </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind behind two attacks, during which it was this summer killed 77 people in Norway, during his first public court hearing in Oslo, described himself as a champion of &quot;resistance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I&apos;m the military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and between Norwegian templářskými Knight,&quot; he said before the court, where 500 people had gathered. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I object to the Court of Justice, because you mandate granted organization promoting an ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I confess to their crimes, but I admit any guilt for them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue said, because &quot;he didn&apos;t want to give Breivikovi opportunity to this hearing he used as a platform from which might be able to voice their opinions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he refused Breivikovi he had brought with him a speech prepared, to allow at the end of the hearing to address the relatives of their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered the police to Breivik, held in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media after a period of 4 nadsats and announced that authorities will be valid for a period of eight weeks of complete control over all his visits and all correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope that they will be able to look into the eyes of Breivikovi, others because they believe he is being held tightly under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All took part in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman,&quot; the observer said NRK, one of the survivors of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It wasn&apos;t pleasant, but for myself, I can say that, after what I saw and heard the suspect, I was mentally pushed back a little further.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm throughout the hearing and professional. On arrival and departure into the building without regard to journalists and to the survivors in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the Breivikově bizarre notion that is part of a larger movement &quot;of resistance,&quot; the judge decided not crazy, and said that there is no evidence that he had any accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> For someone may be consolation that attacks on June 22, appear to be the work of a single group not extremists and radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> However, it automatically does not diminish the grief and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wish that fell like a monster, but it is not so,&quot; said a relative of one of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;If so, it would have been much easier.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> The lessons of the lost 7 interview with Steve Jobsem in the movie streaming towards the cinemas this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> When Steve Jobs died on October 5, began to explore the views of the people who compared with Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius Greatest modern inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> The newly recovered purse recently Jobsově conversation which oprášen for special film, which is heading into cinemas this week, it will be for all fans of Apple, the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and work flows standing for its products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was a wonderful designer dreamer and self-proclaimed a member of hippie culture, but at the same time a pedantic organizer and a man who every little thing goes into great detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from &quot;the idea that it is really a great idea of 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a long way to go bites work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, he worked on the TV show Bob Cringely Triumph of computer fools, which dealt with the dawn of the personal computer. During the filming took place unique, more than an hour-long conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> By then it was already 10 years since Jobs was forced to leave the company, Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company Next, and looking out for as broad public acceptance of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In the TV show was eventually used only a short part of the entire Cringelyho conversation and the original copies of the interview said that were lost in the transfer. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Shortly after the death of Jobsově VHS copies, however, were found in the garage režisérově. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> It is this material, slightly cut, form the basis of 68minutového slide Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, which was heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who was known for his reluctance to provide longer talks here Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic that they can talk about their technological philosophy and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And it also shows as a very thoughtful man. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Four times during the interview, between a question-and-answer that there will be a longer pause - 10 to 15 seconds thinking, which is to see how Jobs is thinking about a perfect answer to what has been the most accurate and most accurate. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when the surface area of the sails Jobsův perfectionism, when Cringelyho issues are impatient and encouraged him to hurry to more important problems and issues. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The interview was filmed before the days of Pixaru, iPod or iPhone and appear in it eerily prophetic thoughts, when Jobs assesses what other companies are doing right and wrong, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read a postmortem evaluation Jobsovy career, but on Jobsovi, whom we see here the earnest dreamer in the prime of his genius, is something raw and inspirational. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Here is his own vision of how the case could and should look like. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> It didn&apos;t take long, and after his thoughts, is also said to be put into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of the seven scenes of Lost interview, which is certainly worth noting: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> How he learned to drive the company: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During the years of business, I&apos;ve always asked: Why are you doing this? &apos;And the answer was always the same: Well, that&apos;s the way it is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does, never on matters relating to the business doesn&apos;t think in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I found out. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs goes on to say that describes his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> He was totally confused by the way in which they were recorded costs - often began reading &quot;standard costs&quot; of their amount could only speculate. At that moment, he decided to go their own way - has developed an instrument that guaranteed that they could trade costs to determine within seconds. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How did rošťárnu the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs remembers the &quot;blue box&quot; constructed by Steve Wozniakem - devices that allow people to tap into the phone company and free of charge to call anywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device that was in the past, has written numerous, but Jobsovo enthusiasm when Blue box describes as an instrument of power, it is literally contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Tells how with Wozniakem tested a device using a pay phone, and during the conversation to transfer from one network AT &amp; T to another, while the use of the greatest possible number of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We like that at least půltucetkrát through all around the world, so if we then shouted something to the pay-phone, it came a minute later from a second phone at the door,&quot; he laughs Jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we have found that they can build a case that is able to manage the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The two of us we made a tiny, which could control the much larger giant - it was an incredible experience and I would never emerged without her apple. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Describing Jobs continues a joke with Wozniakem almost to the end. Through Blue box in the middle of the night was summoned to the Vatican and asked about whether it would be able to speak with the pope, taking the best posing as Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Gradually they were drafted more senior members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, and only just before the phone up and the pope with a pair of laughter and put the phone down. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> How he fell in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlettem): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> When he was 12 and had been looking for spare parts so that he could build-, found in the phone book on Bill Hewletta number and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Not long after their 20minutovém conversation Jobs had already secured summer jobs in the company of Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;Incredibly has affected me. It was the only company that I knew at that time, and shaped my view of what the company is and how to treat their employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs later became one of HP employees, who visited the corporate research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer, which was ever produced.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor and I fell in love with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> As a teenager I in HP moved higher and higher, I&apos;ve been hanging around the computer and began to write programs for him. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How up innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> In a few places Jobs during the conversation about how dreaming up new products for the run. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> In the early days of his career, when he moved to sell a couple of printed circuit boards, one customer asked for him to put together a computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and add special equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> When he was later in the company of Apple, remembers the problems faced in the development of the computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember how we were quite fierce fighting... they shouted at me, that it would take five years [to draw up a mouse, which would cost USD 300], when I got tired, I went out and found a designer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> How large companies running out of breath: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs prudently predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision of the wobbles and lose its market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;Let&apos;s say that you are working for companies IBM and Xerox, so you do better copiers and printers, and what&apos;s next?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Do you have a monopoly on the market, so the company is already the company cannot be more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> At that moment, a sales and marketing, so that firms were running the people who are in charge of just that, while the people in charge of their own products are taken out of the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Technological genius, who led the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of the good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That&apos;s exactly what happened in the company of Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> The company Xerox could have virtually the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could be 10 times bigger than it is, could be the Microsoft of the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Instead of victory, however, created a defeat. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> How takes innovation as a form of art: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;Between an excellent idea and an excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and how this great idea develops, it will be changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> During that time, you learn a lot about him. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> You must go to a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories to do something. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You must remember constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and putting them together... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, a matter of taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a way, is trying to reflect on what they are doing. </seg>

<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the health care at a time when their case dealt with by the court </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day when the Supreme Court sat down behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept a challenge against the law on health care, President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court to participate in the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine justices convened to discuss the proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases the action was brought by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care, which was approved by Congress last year - a law, which mobilized conservative activists around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges have agreed that they will listen to the action in March, however, expects 5,5hodinové negotiations, the outcome of which, moreover, even more unsettling presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and at the time of the decision will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer, who&apos;s going to stand up before the Court of Justice and will try to achieve a rejection of the bill, will most likely Paul Clement, who served as attorney general of the United States in the reign of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has long years of active in defense of conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company, which sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade association of questioning the law, called the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of the huge amount of money at stake. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the debate on the topic of that case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> He attended, among others, as well as Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and endorsed by opponents of the health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> And the marketing of guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> It&apos;s nothing new: This pair of judges, the actions of the Federalist Society attended for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And certainly it is not for nothing that would be in violation of the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct, which are subject to less federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If it was not the case, however, their behavior would certainly fall under the principle of C4, which says that &quot;a judge may participate in the actions that are being related and other organisations hold in order to obtain funds, but the judge may not be speaker, the guest of honor, nor shall not be appearing on the programme of action.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two law firms acting in the case, and also the company with an enormous financial interest in this case, was alerted to the activists calling for ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some of the judges to the Supreme Court acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judge,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of the organization Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were drinking and dined on social benefit, together with legal representatives, who are waiting to hear his case before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the legs all claims to the open-mindedness, which is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas against its critics have shown little understanding and advise them that they also combine their legal obligations without problems with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Thomas&apos;s wife, Ginni is high-ranking conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly of Justice Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan worked as chief prosecutor for the government of President Obama, when he appeared before the court, the first to oppose the law. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Critics Kaganové are pushing for her to take part in the case, and says that if the law had fought for so many to now could be detached. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan did not hinted that it was about to resign. </seg>

<seg id="1698"> Many airlines in the Middle East is one of the nations těžícím oil. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not as crucial, because the country itself on higher oil prices. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important, because they are not as likely as with other airlines might cancel or postpone aircraft orders because of the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;They are so natural protection,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The contract from the airlines Emirates strengthens the company&apos;s leading position in the market for aircraft Boeaing wide body and brings to a close the company Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to break the dominance of the Boeing, the A350 model of transport. </seg>

<seg id="1708"> It seems that the nurse Felipe Calderon in the violent state elections for the post of governor in Michoacánu lost. On Monday, subsequently said that one of her opponents to victory lifted the drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The preliminary results has assigned the gubernatorial election in the western state of Faust Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;Interference by members of organized crime in the whole of the electoral process and especially to last the course of the elections is alarming, not only for the Michoacán, but for the whole of our country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderonová radio in an interview on the day after Sunday&apos;s elections. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, members of the group for the poll... They took ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let the people vote on order for the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the Presidency came. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> Early, however, plans to return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacánu is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes that will win even in July in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> It seems that Vallejo beat Calderonovou, who only the day before the election, only very close. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderonová, candidate for the conservative side of his brother&apos;s National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejona as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> The third placed Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for a party of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now has dominated the governorship. For squabbling and bad luck is to portray the party ahead of the presidential elections in 2012 on the very unfortunate defeat. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital city of the state on behalf of Morelia, any kind of relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates for the recognition of the results. </seg>

<seg id="1726"> Bank ADB calls on Asia, to help save the euro area </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Bank of the Asian Development Bank called on India and China, in order to be ready to help with the rescue of the euro before its severe debt crisis, otherwise, it could lead to the overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, Director-General Bank ADB, based in Manila, said that two of the fastest growing economies in the world must &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to contribute to the rapid recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> It warned that the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China] all of Europe&apos;s problems are &quot;very calmly&quot; and said that the Asian financial aid in combination with European leadership and resources will help to defuse the long-term collapse of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We&apos;re all in this together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So convenient, anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia is maybe to some extent protected, but it is certainly not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, it would certainly have to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> The European monetary association is already several months severely tested a severe debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, Italy&apos;s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> Increasing the debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that could pull the global economy back into recession, and began appearing calls to newly prosperous the leading economies together and have helped the euro zone to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag predicted that all Asian aid will be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds of the financial bailout of the European Union, the institutions for European financial stability - would Asian partners of European countries to provide more negotiating capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, India&apos;s trade minister, said that &quot;India will do what he can,&quot; to help the euro zone, because its own economy now suffer from a drop in exports dry up and the inflow of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;No one wants to the euro area remained unstable and nervous,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high growth rate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not an option, it is a statement of fact, because how else we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that emerging economies, like that of India&apos;s, they have nothing to help European economies, if they are forced to confront their own serious economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain to aid for Europe of the 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of whom live on $2 or less a day. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;Once they could find that the Greeks goes into retirement at 50 and enjoy a holiday on the beaches, which they might find it difficult to explain,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, likewise, questioned why they should be Indian stocks used to keep well-paid jobs many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Nag, pointed out that the crisis now threatens to &quot;dangerous domino effects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The bank&apos;s forecast that Asia will occur between the years 2011 / 2012 to 7.5% economic growth, is now facing a &quot;risk of falling&quot; due to European threats. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He said that the vulnerable emerging markets must create &quot;plans for unforeseen expenditure&quot; to be protected from the downturn and a significant outflow of capital from their economies. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> The warning from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta Monday in Congress a coaling, when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget may endanger national security and cause financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon will have to reduce budget already spend about $450 billion over the next 10 years, but now fears a further reduction of $600 billion, if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire portfolio,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget, and the resulting the so-called attachment to 23% flat-rate decline and stop the many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;For such a huge reduction, used the following an imprudent manner, it will not be possible to implement most of our construction or marine projects - you can&apos;t buy only three-quarters of the building or ships. In addition, would result in serious damage to the other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote Senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We will also urge separated many of our civil servants, and since the reductions take place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians sent on compulsory leave, in order to be able to meet the requirements.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes may shake the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Finally, the cuts affect and combat units, Panetta said. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;Although accounts for the financing of the possible war operations overseas, this obstávka directly affected, the operation will be adversely affected by the severe changes in other budgets,&quot; said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;There will be cuts in the staff, which will result in a delay of prearranged contracts to support the war effort of our people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;State-paid employees will be reduced, which will begin to run and late payments to suppliers and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Both senators Panettovi written 10 days ago, asking for details on the possible effects on the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequences of obstávky at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a global military power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are strictly against this tough measures,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when Panettův published a letter. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;It is not a conclusion that we were able to live, and we certainly don&apos;t want to sign under him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> &quot;It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and will intensify voices calling for the Pentagon&apos;s omission from the list of seškrtaných areas. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta was recently in talks on the possible cuts more and more open, even though he went on his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience to the approval of the positions in Congress and the White House, so he knew that taking a tough fight. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference held by minutý week Defense Minister suggested a brief picture of what may await his portfolio - a shell of the army, inside which, however, will miss the core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It will be like a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It will be like a brigade without ammunition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It will be like the Air Force without trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It will be like a paper tiger, as the army barracks, buildings and bombs without an adequate number of trained soldiers who might be able to complete the mission,&quot; Panetta said at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It will be as a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;As a result, will be welcome aggression...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In Annex delivered a letter McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how the cuts will result in &quot;significant operating risks: A late response to the crisis, the conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction of drops and the deployment of around the world; the unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Panetta also said that some of the largest defense projects could wait for closure, including those that are already being tested, even those that are still in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> On the list was the F35 aircraft project, for example, the planned new bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, new coastal combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, which wanted the Army and Marines to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> The suspension of further development and testing of the F35 aircraft over the next 10 years would save $80 billion, but his supporters argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the army, which is the need for countries to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A glance at recent headlines suggests how serious and pervasive are lies and deception in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with accusations that he sexually harassed a number of women - both sides claim that the other is lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Administrators at the University of Penn State were accused of perjury, when they tried to hide the records about a retired football coach sexually attacked the boy. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was seen running a microphone says the American president Barracku Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lie could destroy the entire career and sway the stability of many countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York Congressman Anthony Weiner and Internet-based performer made a fool of himself, when he published the information, which was immediately refuted indisputable evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of being abused the finances of his campaign to try to conceal his extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And no one would never forget the media circus, which pulled around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Everywhere was filled with stories of cheating in school and at the university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to make themselves look good in their reports. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentoři, who should learn to the contrary, sending the message that a lie and fraud is acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> With many fraud we meet? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Let&apos;s assume that many of them are merciful lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that foreign people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in life or reaching three times. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Determining the lies, or &quot;recognition of lies,&quot; is the necessary skills, which should adopt each, whether for work or personal reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, a charade when a man cries out: &quot;I&apos;ve got you.&quot; Detecting deception is a serious science working with scientific data collected during the last six decades in prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been refuted. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Liar, you look into his eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> It&apos;s not as if the zadrhávali, cobbler, blush or were smirking. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Nevyvozujte, however, that it is too difficult to spot a liar and reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A trained identifier lies can figure out the truth of the small expression on his face, the creation of questions and their timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge of the major and emerging industries related to detect lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skills, which is easy to learn and in today&apos;s complex world, you can really help - especially if between your responsibilities include hiring, conducting interviews, negotiation or leadership. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars can well read in the other, let&apos;s let down his guard channel their emotions and intuitively aware of how the other party is accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that extroverti lie more frequently than introverti that men issuing more &quot;egomaniac&quot; lies, while women say more lies &quot;aimed at other&quot; - mostly to protect someone&apos;s feelings - that married people lie less often its partners than single people (of course lies which, they say, tend to be &quot;outrageous&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when you are lying. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How do you know that someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First to observe the normal behavior of the body. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> It&apos;s called &quot;the initial observation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It will have a later findings with the match. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Note the posture of the body, his laughter, work with the voice. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know if someone normally kept tapping their feet to wrongly accused him of lying just because it was the middle of the meeting will start tapping his feet. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then try to identify the clusters of false verbal and neverbálního behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> However, think of it only as a warning signals, not as proof of lies. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People speaking a lie can stop moving upper body, if he tries to remember his cover story, boots can get to the door, lean toward the east, significantly change the posture or to show &quot;a sense of relief after the end of the conversation&quot; - an exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position, if the confession is difficult for them. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The people conducting interviews often give a false signal that is at the end of the interview, just to see how it will look like a relief after its closure. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also feel the language of the body. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> It is a story about Scott Peterson had misspoken and used the last time, when he claimed that his murdered wife is alive, which ran in a nationwide search for her body. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Klamající individuals may also speak bluntly: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with the woman, Miss Lewinsky&quot; or the difficult question all be repeated. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal characters are only a very slight. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Anyone can use a lot of &quot;zmírňujícího language&quot; when responding to a difficult question: &quot;Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In a response to the facts and we too often it is another warning signal. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills, through which one can lie hunt them down. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Using these skills will have a greater chance that, in their personal and working buys a liar and con man. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after a threat to delay approval of the US government </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which had brought against the union, but calmed environmentalists - the company in charge of the construction of the pipeline has announced that it is willing to redirect the project so as to set things in motion again. </seg>

<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraské government. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The company TransCanada Stupce Alex Pourbax contends that the company is convinced that, in the end, the construction of the pipeline will be approved, although will lead another route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The announcement came after the Foreign Ministry announced last week that it is postponing a decision on federal permits for the project, which has carried out studies on the possible alternatives, through which they could not intervene in the area in the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reserves. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is really a step forward,&quot; said Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> A new environmental report commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would likely any decision pushed up to 2013, the year after next year&apos;s elections, however, the authorities reject that politics played a role in the decision. </seg>

<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process of setting up a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than is usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, because of the amount of debt soared to unsustainable levels. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package, which require European leaders. Only then will it be possible to restore the credibility of Italy nabouranou. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The Monti is under pressure to hurry. Because of the volatility of the markets have exceeded the interest from Italian BTP bonds with a maturity of 10 years 7 percentage threshold level, when Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue. </seg>

<seg id="2000"> After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi will resign, the interest of Italian bonds returned to a critical level and are responding to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> To save Italy, whose public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the capabilities of the current financial reserves of the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti said that his government would be in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, and despite the general forecasts, which argues that politicians give him the time only for it to carry out reforms, and then makes the early elections. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti said that he would like to incorporate into his cabinet policy, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts, led to Italy from the trouble, which put the country on the grounds of the financial pressure. </seg>

<seg id="2037"> For your Costa Rican fans it is a dream come true. Pearl jam will play in Costa Rica. You realize what are your fans? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> The trip to Costa Rica is our dream, which is becoming a reality. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> In South and Central America, we barely a second time and experience have been great. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I was in Costa Rica just once, on holiday. It&apos;s a beautiful country, and I believe that we will be able to stay here for a few days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> So we have a great joy that we can bring our music. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask, because here on behalf of the literally adore, fans are very much these days of preparation. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do you think of your nejskalnějším supporters? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you stood with us so long for a number of years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you waited so long and we regret that it took us so long. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people have been talking about the concert as the greatest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> It raises in you more pressure? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the biggest show that we have demonstrated over the past 21 years, have arisen in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have some excellent show in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we get into shape for the concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> In fact, we are looking forward to the concert power. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, like serfujeme, we like the jungle. For both activities of Costa Rica is the best country in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves due to surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves are unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or in Nicaragua, or to Mexico. This is the best place to surfing. And so we know of Costa Rica, by people who love of surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> If you look at your tour, you have prepared a great show with many of the songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What you have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> In view of the fact that we&apos;ve never played here, we have no restrictions on what we could do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We&apos;ll try to do the best show with different tracks. We will try to play a couple of songs from each album and see our fans a good and varied repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never neopakujete repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why?. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that this is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everybody likes other tracks, so it is hard to choose which songs we play every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we got in the repertoire of two of the three songs, which we have not played for a long time, we focus on them and we are also a surprise, because we remember why we are favourites and we&apos;re getting maybe forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> So it is for us to show more interesting, and therefore, I think it is more interesting and for the people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> This tour you celebrate 20 years of artistic career. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, it&apos;s hard to believe everything you have done? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, it sure. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a large rock group and that we stay in it for more than 20 years. It sounds like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We are aware of how much is given to us and it moves us, that we can continue to play together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love each other and like to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We&apos;re lucky that we can look at the place, after which we have always wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> We couldn&apos;t have gone better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> For what you meant that you were an important part of the genre grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> For us it was always honored to be part of this group, which are represented in all the big boys. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in chains are our friends. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when there is a movement of a group of friends, it doesn&apos;t happen very often. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, there is a group in the city, but it is far less common for from one of the city suddenly came five to ten groups. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud of it, and we are honored to be part of a group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes with some of the more we play. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we were at the festival with Alice in chains and we were in Canada, Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw on the tour. &quot;We&apos;re lucky that they are all our friends and we are so honored to be part of this movement, launched in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very unusual for the group as your stay together and had even after all these years, still the same members. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, the four of us together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) join us 13 years ago, that in itself is a much longer period than is usual duration of the group. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> I think, first of all, we are all lucky that we are still in this world and, secondly, his role is played by the fact that we are constantly on each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends and because of that we have managed to open the musical journey that leave each sufficient freedom to his own experimentation. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think that it couldn&apos;t be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find the balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew, it was gradually becoming easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We try not to go too on tour, because it is very easy to fall into the trap of crowds and the people who love our music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> When you realise that people came because of the music, you&apos;ll remind you that you have music and what you gave her, respect the... You must not be overwhelmed by the fact that you are famous, rock stars. That neither one of us never really cared. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember the next project Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> As the band we have existed for three years and we&apos;ve never made any album until after he died, Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that, even today, the association with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in a band with us. When you hear a song or I look at the pictures, I remember Andy, as was incredible, as I was with him at the axeman. It&apos;s always been a pleasure to work with him, laughing, talking about music or about football and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an incredible person and we are missing. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> National band Las Robertas will be responsible for in Costa Rica opened the show. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that&apos;s why you is selected as the opening for? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, we sent a video production with several proposals and this group we liked the most. That&apos;s why we&apos;re wondering what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very funny. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why always live changing the words of the Yellow Ledbetter? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is the question to Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&apos;t know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings and I think that is the first thing that comes into his head. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Who you as sure that the bass player&apos;s intact affects? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> A lot of people. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> As the first I think Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many of them that I could all evening to talk about basistech who I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> Both managed to Pearl jam to keep the grunge, even though he is no longer in vogue? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we&apos;ve all felt slightly separation from the words of grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When they say &quot;grunge, imagine the group I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all the others that have arisen in the same period of time, and if it is today, this music valid, so it&apos;s something great, because it&apos;s the music, which is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney music played better today than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning of your music was slightly grim character and it is now more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What is behind this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It&apos;s interesting, because I feel that in the new album is a couple of songs, which are lighter-style, but there are also songs such as The End or juste breathe, which are considered to be very grim, even though they may be taken as a positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> In both of the two, Ed is when I played, so I was crying, and these are songs deep dark. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think about growing up and you&apos;re in the life of a trauma, you lose a family member or friend, these things will affect your art and music, and these two songs for me this is what they represent. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I think that you can be a happy man and still do a somber music. </seg>

<seg id="2161"> Along with the president of the Generalitat, Arthur Meat, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujolem act ceremony attended by former socialist adviser for education, Ernest Maragall, and a former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Goma. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In a large hall Fabra and coats appear as well as the current adviser for social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Director-General of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mas said that Trinijove originated in a very difficult time and that today&apos;s time also offers a wide range of obstacles, but he added that the association has brought to this day, &quot;is a good basis.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2164"> The president said Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to fight against adversity and how to deliver the courage of the people in difficult situations. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> &quot;The crisis is not for this organization and for the work he is doing, nothing new,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> The eviction of the house in which the parties held giant </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The intruders took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51 </seg>
<seg id="2168"> 12 invaders have left the house at noon yesterday, without asking the opposition </seg>
<seg id="2169"> All the indications are that the nightmare of their neighbors in the number 51 in the street Balmes, has finally come to an end. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, which illegally occupied and where organized the gigantic parties, which had some of the neighbours. The building left from the order of the court and without having to interfere with the police. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> After the end of the operation was replaced the lock on the door, to avoid a repeat of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From this moment the entry will be watching,&quot; said the administrator. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the remaining are inhabited - walked all electrical and partly as a result of water facilities, in addition to giving the wall, leaving garbage all kinds, particularly the cans for alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> In the first three quarters, there have been huge parties, which lasted up to two days and to provoke the other tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In addition to the building&apos;s disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for the Europa Press that during the period when the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the discotheque stresses that the occupants of the building were making her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while in a disco is 10. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaint neighbors because of the noise. But problems nezpůsobovali visitors discos, but the occupants of the house, and in particular those who participated in here organised by parties whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks has increased, according to the angry residents of the area. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that even agreed with the owner of the building and already nine months forgave her rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neighbors on the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The President of the urban group People&apos;s Party PP at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for &quot;building was immediately removed and put an end to the problems of cohabitation, which suffers from the neighbors, and with the destruction of the region.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The President of the People&apos;s Party members voted explained that before the summer was staked out only one floor, but in recent months the invaders were given to all floors of the building, and almost all of the homes and in one of them, it has even theft. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this regard, he added that &quot;it is necessary to put an end to impunity and be consistent, if it is the actions against civil responsibility that occurred in the building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in the Nou Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> In 15 hours 30 minutes, the police got into the building 35 on the street Mont-included after what it called neighbors, who was seen going into the building of four people. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> All four were immediately detained. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or the mountains? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects gathered on the occasion of the launching of the proceedings, which carries more than controversy about the fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The city&apos;s selection procedure for 16 gates again opened the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid-1980s, at the height of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government printed a number of pamphlets in support of the park Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Letáček defined the mountain as a large park metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> What&apos;s more, he was accompanied by a numerical comparisons with the New York Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> After the CMB lapsed in 1987, the park is back in the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (the sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Qualification Collseroly as a natural park is moving in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Reference has already was not Central Park, but Yellowstone with feisty instead of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> That was the position until September, when the city hall announced mega competition of 16 competitions for the same number of the entry gates to Collseroly. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Rather, the idea, of course, plays into the park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone tries to put the gate to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> There is only one question: The Collserola, park or a mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisational, so on the basis of reflection on the city, the question becomes the central theme of all the Barcelona architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is already the subject as tired as when two members of the old caste chosen at a meeting in the elevator to hand. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it is this act has caused one of the rare matches between what he thinks three barcelonští předstoupivší architects and university professors. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The competition has merit. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> According to Roldána after broached the question of the Gulf, &quot;it is necessary&quot; to discuss the &quot;mountain side,&quot; Ildefonse speech Cerda of green apples has not been completed. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;We must be based on the principle that nejrozlehlejším Barcelona in the park&apos;s beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, his great availability. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;said the architect, for which the name&quot; gateway into the Collserola &quot;carries with it the&quot; lexikologickou trap &quot;: We must not be&quot; as inputs into the park, but rather as the demarcation of the zones, where it is possible to operate. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as well as the Roldan and Bayona with experience of the world urbanism qualifies as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; offering &quot;some danger.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The danger of &quot;uncertainty, which today is a project of public space&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, which was in the area of the Forum &quot;his swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first concern is the very definition of the border, where should build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Something to define the means to do for the next step,&quot; that is, in principle, to move a step further. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;It should be borne in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current (with reference to General Purpose metropolitan plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> If we look at the issue in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope Collserola can be &quot;considered a park,&quot; but the Barcelona underground part not for reasons that are purely topographical. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol also reminded that there is already a work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;may not end up in the garbage,&quot; although welcomes the fact that City Hall offers its context, that the project will hit from the first moment. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And, in addition, understands that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; that it should be just this technical profile, who will lead a multi-disciplinary teams (&quot;it&apos;s all about the skills,&quot; adds), which is to be created: &quot;Architects should be only the tools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which gave the name of this game is difficult, because the competition is missing in the background for a global vision Collserola: &quot;Was published 16 competitions, which deal with all the axis of the mountains, the sea, but there is no longitudinal study, which looked at the area and see it as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has meant that at least he volunteered for all 16 of the competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the project one gate may hint at the concept and the definition of an architect neighboring gate. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, the town hall was to guarantee that the zone located directly above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino forgave Jonási Larrazábalovi, which will be released </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days imprisonment legal Agent Cadino Red pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the process, in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in jail and will now be released after his legal Agent casino Red pardoned before the Second Criminal Court in the District, who heard the case of blackmail in which he was indicted by a brother of the mayor of Monterrey. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the assassination of casino Royale owner Casinos Red, Sergio Gil García, has published a series of photographs and videos, on which he was Manuel Jonás for him to demand payment of economic quotas to City Hall in Monterrey to illegal operation in the second house. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The public indictment of the public prosecutor&apos;s office has launched a criminal prosecution of the brother panistického mayor. 2 September was arrested and jailed for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Ministry of Public Agent No. 3 for property crimes has been transferred to the prison, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the state capital. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> At this point, he remained the 49 days after it was issued another regulation to imprisonment and an agent of the ministry refuted the possibility of complicity or organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> 19 October was transferred to the criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmail owners Casinos Red amount of one and a half million peso. However, stayed only a few hours in jail with moderate supervision, because he had been threatened with death. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The leaders during the process allowed him to stay in the urban cells in San Nicolas de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> 25 October will be submitted to the arrest warrant, issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigations has been gathered enough evidence to prove guilt Jonásovu. Among the evidence includes, for example, payment of 1.5 million peso representatives of casinos in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday, the legal Agent Casinos Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, arrived to Judge José Luis Pecinovi and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On the basis that he will be able to soon return to freedom. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the legal representative of the meeting, the ministry allocated to this court, Ramiro Arias, said Garcia Gómeze, whether they were repaired the damage and one of the partners decided to grant the pardon. Lawyer but made it clear that the name will remain secret. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> On the basis of the record 197 / 2011 will be granted a pardon Jonási Larrazábalovi. In the process, which was held against him, it will not be possible to lodge any complaint. Also, it is not possible to qualify for compensation for damage or punishment. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> After the hearing, a legal agent around 15: 50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábala Bretóna. </seg>

<seg id="2235"> He also announced that the judge had issued an order for his release. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Secretary General Dionisio Pérez Jácome unveiled details about the accident, which killed the governor&apos;s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) said that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the government killed Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people indicates that the helicopter landed directly on the ground with full force, without the pilot had the chance to try a forced landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that the pilot of the aircraft before takeoff, noted that the climatic conditions for years. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;Part of that appear, suggest that several times unit came into contact with the ground, wings entangled in the branches of trees 25 yards from where the unit has lost its hull.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Also reported that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore meets all the requirements for the transportation of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, said that on the basis of investigations carried out in the area of impact, have not found any parts of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;When searching, it was found that parts of the aircraft are not located in another place, the aircraft crashed on the continent as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meets all the requirements for the transport of persons. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The terrain shows the slope with a penchant for seven to thirty degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> The secretary said that at the moment, the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Gilberto Lopez Meyer, general director of airports and auxiliary services said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter Presidential General Staff moved the cruise speed and the accident occurred on the soft ascending the terrain. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident, it was a normal crossing operation,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference representative of the SCT Pérez Jácome listed six basis points investigations: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual years: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In accordance with the air standards was years implemented under visual flight rules, that means that the crew must during the flight to see on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> The weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> A report in the AICM given adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with the plane is moving toward the border between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible cloud layers at low altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> The routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that, because of the clouds, the crew was looking for lower area and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> The location of the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of the impact and the last entry helicopter from radar agree, it is likely that before the crash to avoid losing control and the disruption of the trajectory of the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Scattered remnants of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information, which we are currently available, allows us to assume that the collision occurred on a flat track, and from the side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> Drawing the scattering the remains of the aircraft suggests that at the time of impact on land the helicopter was complete. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Not a fire or explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> At the scene of the crash, there were no evidence to suggest that there was an explosion or a fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Final results of the investigation show that may have been a few contacts with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the off-road works have been found the remains of the plane at a height of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground is convex, the tendency is seven to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show footage in which is likely to break up along the route. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information it provides elements, which seems to suggest that the helicopter could have come in contact with the ground in several places. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a thorough search in the vicinity of the accident in the territory, which is larger than that of the establishment, have not found the remains of the helicopter, which reinforces the assumption that the collision took place in a state where the helicopter was still intact. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> Mexico&apos;s Health Insurance Institute has launched a research into the gene that causes obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The Institute of health insurance leads research to discover a gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. Research carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Mexico&apos;s Health Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that conducts research in order to detect gene that causes obesity in children and young. Research called &quot;the genetics of obesity in children and adolescents&quot; will make it possible to obtain the results on the overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In the report, Head of Research Medical Unit in the biochemistry of specialised hospitals National Health Center of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, he explained, that was set up a multi-disciplinary team, composed of doctors, nurses, nutritional experts and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team relies on the support of specialists and students graduate program at the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and of the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) National polytechnického Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> To participate in the research may also the general public, having or not having permission. People can come into participating in sports centres IMSS in Valle de México, where they each a Saturday from 8 hours to carry out tests of adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Stressed that the research began in Sports Centre Cuauhtémoc (the Mexican State) and from 8 October, this activity is also in Sports Center Nezahualcóyolt (Eastern Time (the state). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once they obtained data from 500 to 600 children, will continue in the study&apos;s Sports Center Independencia (south of Federal District) and finally in Morelos&apos;s Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the aim of the research is to determine the components and the importance of genetics, as regards the development of obesity, and traced to Mexican children and young people risk factors and thereby prevent chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the International Day of diabetes, which is celebrated on November 14, said that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of a child, for application specific questionnaires about nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The questionnaire also asks for physical activity and a family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid the risk factors that could cause the disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Said that every Saturday with all the parties to implement antropometrická measurements (weight, height and waist circumference), measured, blood pressure, determines the level of glucose, of triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and examined the genes (tries to identify the genes that are implicated in child obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals over an alarming increase in children&apos;s weight. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;Health survey carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only for boys to the rise in obesity by 77% and for girls of 47%. There has also been a dramatic increase in the case of overweight, &quot;said an expert from the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is a presumption that the population of the country is different from the rest of his genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Informed that the average Mexican has a 65% indiánsko-American genetic makeup, 30% 5% of European and African. This is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the emergence of diabetes and obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is normally explains as the inability to burn off excess energy that we consume (calories), which is stored as fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they get an overall assessment of the state of children, which will determine whether they show known overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Said that even the presence of wrinkles dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and forearm suggests the likelihood that a person will suffer metabolic problems and předcukrovkovými conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Meanwhile, the information is confidential, doctors in writing to her parents and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes that have to do to their children to avoid the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz Lopez explained that there are three key ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: A sedentary life, meaning the lack of daily physical activity, all-day sitting in front of the TV and the use of means of transport instead of walking the short distance. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Overweight also causes great caloric intake, that is, the greater the consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.), high-fat and protein and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In the asphalt of unam will not be potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Chemical School unam creates a modified Asphalts with polymers and creating a mixture of having a better functionality, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If properly handled on the pavement, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each of the rainy season in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the Chemical School (Fq) from unam, who, at the same time, he added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be is completely removed. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture Technology cause potholes, which he said in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership has modified Asphalts with polymers, which should be mixed with characteristics similar to the asphalt, but at the same time more mechanical resistance, both at low and at high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified bitumen suppliers could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example, in some towns in the north of the country. It would improve the functioning and reduce the creation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbon molecules with high molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are called malteny. Together supply asphalt typical viskoelastický character. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viskoelastický character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a fluid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost in solid form, while the low-temperature asphalt, has a tendency to break, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resilience of the asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but they do during the day, according to the meteorological conditions and temperatures, said an expert in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> A scientist from the Chemical School observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México is covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, three of which last are mixed with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Nejsvrchnějšími is located between the layers of the cartridge, made up of small stones set in the asphalt and then compressed. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Stress that each stone, which is comprised of the cartridge, is tinged with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> In transit cars or in creating pressure it is possible that the forces in the pavement well spread out. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it had been modified asphalt, they would be even better, considers a chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> He added that on the asphalt cartridge placed last layer named cloak, made of soft rock, sand also carved in the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Given that this class will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, must be more mechanical power than the cartridge and must ensure the friction of the road. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Whereas, as part of the pavement will be exposed to a large burden, must have a sufficient thickness and you have to take care of the material from which it is made. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, they are also very important factor that should be borne in mind. Especially water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt cartridge. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> As soon as the ground is wet, water is spreading in and it&apos;s hard to get out, it causes a softening of all sections of cobblestones and the emergence of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> He explained that during the creation of potholes as the first film coat and to eat away at the damage to the asphalt cartridge. But there is no damage at one point, but it is a slow process, which should stop at the first sign of using appropriate maintenance programmes. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> As a member of the National System of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual sections of cobblestones must meet the burden of vehicles and must ensure that the burden does not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent the emergence of numerous potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera said that when it comes to the asphalt, we still have a lot of work and research is at the beginning. It is worth noting, for example, the asphalt emulsion, which are in other countries already available on the market and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use a high temperature. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What was missing from the ballot of Valle to become the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> An analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna acquired crown Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle so acquires 14 title first vícemiss. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Valle del Cauca once again on the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with the fact that she was on the podium of, won a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which has become the new first vícemiss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Based on the results of yesterday&apos;s finals in Cartagena, in which she won and the took Miss Atlántico, the department has gained 14 title first vícemiss. Melina, then joined the throngs of women from the Valle del Cauca, which came close to winning the digits, but were finally published the first vícemiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuelo Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The question many are asking. What was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The result is a defeat of the big favorites, which in all the earlier rounds showed that is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the Queen of the police and the Best faces Joile de Volgue. These titles, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to make her only First vícemiss, is the fact that have not been convinced by his answer to the question: &quot;Which book you most like and why?&quot; Asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of literary editors Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> On the question of the candidate said: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. The book, which has affected me most in childhood, was&quot; Little Prince, &quot;a very deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the moment, I&apos;m reading &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot; It&apos;s book, which is part of the global literature that we should all know the... And now I&apos;ve got the book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian writer. This is a wonderful book entitled &quot;El ardor de la sangre.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> The answer is not like the term &quot;culturize,&quot; and secondly, because the candidate has not explained what individual referred her books marked. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> After the formal ceremony Melina has said that it is calm and is pleased with the results: &quot;The world is a wise, what will be will be. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And you people read, if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of front-runner. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Bogotský journalist suggested that that was the most popular candidate from the start, the most celebrated and the one that took all the previous price (gastronomic call Oster, title to the public for the best artistic clothes and the Queen Mother) had aroused the envy of other uchazeček, stress the queen, which then has failed on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> It was evident in the first presentation of the bathing suit at the beach near the Hilton and during two shows before the final of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although both shone, it became apparent that she lacked the strength and passion that they showed the reprezentantky of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme &quot;at home&quot; on Canal RCN believes that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate, who wins the most titles during the competition finally walks away with the crown the Queen. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle in recent days held rather unfriendly attitude toward the media and it proved his undoing. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which are the basis for the National beauty contests. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Just on the edge, two days before the elections, the international jury member Lucy doughty said that they are looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;In a competition, Miss Colombia beauty alone is not enough, you need to see something more than just the physical beauty. The focus should be on social conscience. It is important that the candidates before entering the competition, were involved in such projects,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Also, there is speculation that the candidate Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibrosis, which was on the fanny. But this is completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, which was chosen Miss &quot;natural beauty&quot; for the healthiest body, diet and responsible physical activity. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing a queen, acknowledges that she didn&apos;t have the best body that there were better girls, &quot;but the problems with fibrosis at the bottom, which in my opinion, was not too noticeable, had her points until the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In the meantime, the reporter Guido Hoyos from magazine Cromos believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when he underwent several surgeries. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;Surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle they go wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> The body was never its strong suit and here had taken its toll. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this award, which first udělovalo beauty of the National Assembly, after the parade in a bathing suit has been a cruel predictions, which was filled with. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that gave Raymundo Melina, so she didn&apos;t have to finally give the highest crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Whether it&apos;s true or not, it is certain that Melina today launched a year of his reign, not like a queen, but as a princess, a position which gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the National competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, is entered into history as one of the queens, which despite strhujícímu success in Cartagena to the highest crest. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Such was the work of the residents of Cali, who identified the corpse of Cana </seg>
<seg id="2343"> An expert on fingerprints from the Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of the &quot;Alfonso Cana.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> 4 November last year, an expert on the fingerprints of honor in Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC, &quot;Alfonse Cana&quot; by means of a comparison of fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who work in the department of honor, was this week a series of Eliazar González, men from Puerto Tejada, who 21 years working in the field of research. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he had often more than five days through the jungle to get to the place where they were corpses that had to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000, he had moved to the capital of Valle and after they completed the relevant courses, he began to specialise fingerprints. This science is the study of the friction of the skin, the palms of the hands and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week that was carried out operations against the notified Alfonsi Canovi, Eliazarovi said that he took the clothes to at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> It was expected something big. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night started in the Cauca River in the helicopter from the Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that the suspects that one of them is the man who led the world&apos;s oldest guerillu. Therefore asked him to take the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Le6n Sáenze (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, when he arrived with the investigating team to the place where she was dead, he didn&apos;t recognize it because of the physical appearance. He looked quite differently than in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had a beard, he was dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, a much slimmer. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don&apos;t lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Together with galtonovou magnifying glass, ink and transplantátorem and light Eliazar daktylové records corpses began to compare the records of the cards. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> It does not mislead eye: It was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night a man from Puerto Tejada had been charged to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzónovi, confirmed that it was indeed a supreme commander of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Search for feet </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For daktyloskopa of Sijín de Cali&apos;s recognition that Eliazarovi González showed President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference operational services against &quot;Canovi&quot; very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> A lot of people didn&apos;t know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> Fingerprinting is an exact science, without the possibility of errors that can play a key role in the decision-making of crime. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In addition to the identification of the corpses will help these people for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identities of the trapped people. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> If they are caught, a lot of offenders presenting false documents or have no papers at all. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take fingerprints and we&apos;re looking for is in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The investigator said that in the case of the injuries in the house had to remove a piece of the wall of the house, because this is where the thief leaning that produced a vault full of jewelry and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The walls are difficult, because they are not intended for the collection of fingerprints, but in this case we could get the impression the whole hand and identify the offender, who was involved in several robberies, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> More recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> On the basis of the investigation, it was found that it could be responsible for the murder of one of the family members and a fingerprint on a bottle of it actually confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although it is not 100 percent confirmed that he was indeed the murderer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> An expert on the fingerprints of honour explained that the objects the prints &quot;blurring using chemical or physical reactive substances.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If there are, then, for their collection used transplantátor or tape. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> The prints are then shipped to Asif, a database of offenders, or to registraturu. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that at present, there are still many Colombians, whose data are not recorded anywhere,&quot; said an expert from the honor. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He explained that not everything is as it appears in a television programme CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As well as all that glitters is not gold, not at all what you touch, remain. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> However, if it can be used, they must carry out the appropriate comparison. </seg>

<seg id="2405"> Japan after the devastating earthquake coming back to life </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP is growing by 1.5%, thanks to the consumption of households and ends as the period of falls, which began in March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since March of last year, Japan&apos;s economy has been paralyzed, now is recovering from the devastating earthquake, which had risen in the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster, which have had to face the country since the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates tokyjské governments have quantified the material losses to 300 000 million dollars, a wound which, despite the difficult global situation healing well. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September got into a position that it was possible to definitively turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter, and by 6% a year. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The results of the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assume the greatest growth rate in comparison with the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> Recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of the machines, which are necessary for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, decline of 0.9% compared to the period from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, a real awakening of Japan&apos;s economy is based exclusively on impulse, which forces to use the crisis to emerge from it strengthen, or to restore infrastructures. It is the lack of benefit to start completely from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan awoke. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan&apos;s GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Assigned to flow into the hands of the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the &quot;rescue values&quot; for investors who are fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and ahead of the alarming forecasts the US. It&apos;s a privilege, but it is also a significant burden for export businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> The stronger currency products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is dependent on the financial health of major technological groups. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> For example, Toyota or Sony attributed its poor results in July to September&apos;s rate of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral countries of the EU, the government Yoshihiko Noda is being cautious. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We have to be careful about the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid increase in the yen,&quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> Indeed, the prospects are not very encouraging. </seg>

<seg id="2429"> With the rapid and risk fringe guarantees and uncertainty that prevailed again, Greece is still more twists to the labyrinth, which leads to climb out of a debt crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The presumption that a &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional Greek government is given to the demands of Brussels rather than genuine conviction of political forces, is beginning to confirm. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days, which he got in his appointment, is likely to be short for their application, president of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures in any case will not support and repeated its demand for a new election on the scheduled date of February 19. </seg>

<seg id="2435"> President of the Conservatives went in his speech to the EU and the IMF a bit far. These organisations have to unblock 8 billion, which Athens urgently need. But at the same time, he said, that will not support and will not sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures. </seg>

<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;will continue to work&quot; and to expand the network of volunteers &quot;in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly,&quot; stressed the Queen Sofia, which hopes that the initiative and the benefit of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, &quot;will create better facilities and opportunities for the poorest, particularly for women&quot; who are these loans intended in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;We have already achieved a great deal&quot; and &quot;many challenges are still ahead of us.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The summit of microlending has not only be diskuzním forum, but also a platform to promote &quot;the basic objectives.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Her Majesty explained that the aim is that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to financial services and to receive 100 million families above the poverty threshold below which currently live. </seg>

<seg id="2453"> Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, she said that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; that they must abide by all democratic states. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, she said, that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with only the balohobytu, because this cooperation is &quot;a permanent obligation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jimenez believes that micro-loans represent &quot;a serious and honest policy, which is to eliminate poverty,&quot; and now, more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not to just solidarity has become the victim of cuts. </seg>

<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the President of Europe on the basis of universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic party, Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig on the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the programme, but she became her in the autumn, in particular that they were satisfied by the party members, who considered the policy of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The proposal for the president of the European Commission brought the leadership was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Few minutes standing ovation at the end of the speech, Angela Merkel, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro-European finance minister, left room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main thrust of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan of &quot;response to the crisis&quot; is not less Europe, but more Europe. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe means peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> According to the Chancellor in Europe, &quot;the time has come to change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty, enabling the European Union to strengthen control over budgetary policies of the member countries of the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of a president of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage &quot;in order to give Europe a face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> That is, in any case, one of the ideas the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries to agree quickly on this revolutionary step: Against the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU thinks that also will take the same position of Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the direction is set. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> As delegates rejected a proposal by a large majority of assessing the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Led by concern to calm the climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it did not try to get Congress talk of the &quot;small&quot; European states or countries that are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the proposal concerning Europe devoted one paragraph of the importance of &quot;the Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel France failed to quote. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Only indirectly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> When reminded that just over two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig. </seg>

<seg id="2480"> As an escort of the offensive, which is based on the will to carry out the savings in the context of increased severity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to concentrate on the illness. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to impose on employees of the private sector on the fourth day of illness before they start taking support in the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without the consent of the company would have a staff member who is ill, had lost four days of wages, at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> The measure, which runs the risk of causing a lot of bad blood, but according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring about 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures symbolic range: Give the public employees one day making unpaid work (as yet have no failure compared to three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are the subject of the discussions, the right-wing majority starts also theme fraud aimed this time at abuses tied with the working neschopnostmi. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;The checks will be much larger and more: If you are caught, you will return,&quot; said Xavier Bertrand in the interview provided by the station RTL on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the announcements seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth about wrongdoing in working neschopnostech. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> These were, in fact, the subject of a permanent monitoring since 2002 and political onslaught, which brought its fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not more ill than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> The first stop in a few of the official numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the Caisse nationale d&apos;assurance Maladie (CNAM - state health insurance companies) was in 2006 paid more than 237 million euros daily allowance. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in healthcare represented in 2008, with its daily 11.3 billion euro 5% in health-care spending. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46% of the concerned parent contributions and work-related accidents and 54% working inability, or 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> , only 2.5% of the cost of health care. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> According to a study group Alma Consulting had the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days of illness, compared with 17.8 days in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> The average, which holds a certain date: Another poll published in 2007 in the pages of dealing with jobs Monster.com showed that 75% of respondents 40,000 French staff replied that he didn&apos;t choose to any day of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time by sickness insurance institutions, stipulates that in 2010 was 37.8% working inability to less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 within three months and 11% took longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are more prone to work neschopnostem than elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers of the National Research Center (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence of (for reasons of health or not) has alternated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Cheating in working neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> As regards the fraud, these are just a small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks on the incapacity of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008 the CNAM noted that, with the 1.5 million checks was 13.8% of 285,000 carried out because of the short-term neschopnostem &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; i.e. 37 050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of systematically controlled by the inability of the more than 45 days, the count was 11% of cases &quot;not designed or unjustified&quot; to 1.2 million checks or 132 000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> A total of 169 000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases to several million workers who were sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> The number, which is far less than the number of work on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent a 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection for the year, which is more than the total amount of the daily allowance and therefore infinitely more than fraud related to the latter. </seg>

<seg id="2519"> It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the commission of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> According to a report by the Royal Canadian company is the Canadians deprived of death. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In the case of palliative care Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together in order to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian company is the idea of the denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians really accepts the opportunity to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It&apos;s one of the conclusions of a wide-ranging report of the Royal Canadian companies, which involved six experts working in various fields, among which the ethics, law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The commission recommends the government to change the law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where is this option as necessary in patients deemed to be competent to take such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> At the beginning of the experts cite the recent independent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada ranked in the 10th place, the study notes that the &quot;medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medicalisation of yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, they tell us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian companies. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the wish to die at home, which has a majority of Canadians 68,6% of them dying in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> The average pay for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, the figure is the highest with 86% of those who died in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> When it comes to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report are running out of the conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has said that criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide doesn&apos;t want to change anything. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> According to experts, who also gave control of all of the countries where these approaches are legalised or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalise causes some abuse in the application, i.e., in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons nepříslušné or mismatched. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference more than the numerous cases of these mistakes in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Euthanasia is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; says Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians are inclined to euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let us remember that, according to the survey conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia, because he believes that will allow persons at the end of life to ease their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66%, believes that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending the message that the lives of old or disabled people is worth less. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As regards the persons who have assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed people assessed that should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In the case of maintaining or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also on the list of its recommendations to the claim that it was in the criminal law stated that withdrawal of treatment, for which there is legally confirmed the refusal, not criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> Commission experts also requires that medical specialists had been trained to the obligation to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In the case of palliative care Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together in order to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in the case of palliative or final defuse the already widely used in Canadian medical facilities Commission requires that was seen at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and is subject to the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts on medical law has already expressed its reservations on the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian companies. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified for the position of experts-signatories of the report as &quot;extreme&quot; among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and which should more than 18 years, could apply to help him to commit suicide,&quot; says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé report yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report, built the autonomy of the people above all other values that make up the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Since &quot;in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> Specialist medical law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which he described as a&quot; manifesto for euthanasia. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, which is itself a member of the Royal Canadian companies, in particular, has doubts about the message data concerning the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2638"> On Tuesday, the dollar will again come under 77 yen and the euro dropped below the symbolic level of 105 yen close to levels that triggered the last intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009 was the dollar value of around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> This outbreak of the Japanese currency is bad for the island&apos;s exports, because the price of products made in Japan more expensive and reduces the value of earnings derived by Japanese firms from abroad, when it is translated into the domestic currency. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> &quot;Japan is recovering&quot; from zkáz caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is concerned that the rising yen kill eggs in the still fragile recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> A third economic power in the world, in the third quarter growth (1.5% in the previous quarter) and for the first time in a year, thanks to the exploration of export growth and household consumption, burdened by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister said that the high value of the yen nereflektovala &quot;national economy of Japan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2644"> Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said the Japanese central bank (BoJ), which began Tuesday a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council to take all possible steps leading to a weakening of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2645"> But this institution Hirohide víceguvernér Yamaguči pointed out that the BoJ has previously taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot; to suggest that no additional monetary weakening is expected on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2646"> At its last meeting in late October, the Institute for issuing securities increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) of its purchases of treasury bills, and has increased to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) ceiling amounts, which pays for purchases of securities in order to flood with with liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> The euro area: </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The rates are rising, the stock market failing </seg>
<seg id="2649"> The risk of the debt crisis continued to undermine European indicators. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy and better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue their growth. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> European stock markets still worried about the stability of the euro area is now on Tuesday, November 15, sinking into the negative expectations. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> In Paris the CAC 40 index in 10 hours lost 1.4% to 3.064 points. </seg>

<seg id="2655"> &quot;Nervous investors only too aware of the risk of the disease,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7%, which has suffered due to fears of market participants about Europe&apos;s ability to deal with the debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> &quot;Japan, as well as the rest of the world has his eyes on Europe and shift will continue only variations in a narrow range until investors don&apos;t have evidence that the situation is stabilized,&quot; estimated Mitsušige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> The re-launch of the uncertainties about the future of the euro area is damaging to the currency, which on Tuesday continues its decline. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> The euro is at the lowest level since the last month and a half. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> In 10 hours of the European currency value 1,3570 dollar in the sharp decline of 0.4%. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> According to brokers currency backed away after Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s CDU party at its congress adopted on Monday a proposal, anticipating the possibility to leave the euro area for countries that find themselves in difficulty, consequently, without having to leave the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> This morning on Tuesday, the yield of the Italian 10-year bonds at 6,58% and the proceeds of the Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> This tension on interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce fears of market participants. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The future of the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti strongly demanded in the markets time to correct the situation in Italy at-risk poisoning caused by the amount of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of decisions taken by the 27 October at the euro area summit will be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> Spain&apos;s re-located in a deliberate line markets, when the country held in Sunday elections to the House of Commons. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> The difference rates (&quot;spread&quot;) among the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of the notifying eurozone growth numbers </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The figures say that France has recorded in the third quarter economic growth by 0.4% primarily due to household consumption, which is a little better than expected growth of 0.3%. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The French national institute for statistics and economic studies, however, INSEE revised downwards the number for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> And the truth is that the fourth quarter, which most economists are concerned about. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> For its part, during the same period, Germany registered growth of 0.5%. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> First estimates for the whole of the euro area are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed to the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts must win over the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is any issue that may not grip on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under the emotions, then it&apos;s energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and the price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is only natural that the meeting in the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on-the-spot, which occupies power from nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be successful only if they will explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must establish its position on objective facts and rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> So far, is 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographics will from now on to the year 2050 duplication of electricity demand, if we do not want a large part of the world&apos;s population of important components of life. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will be necessary to face a shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to generate electricity, and it is not necessary to forget about the need to cut emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, which is the subject, which currently are disappearing from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident at Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> And that&apos;s why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> But that is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source capable of replacing himself, or Switzerland, which is considered to be the right to build only the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote that at least some of the countries, continue with determination in their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States is following the Fukushima have decided to expand its fleet of one unit of the resumption of the construction of a power plant adjourned after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model based on renewable energies sometimes presented as an example, the reality of it is. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will take effect electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> All of these unpleasant effects will be felt within several months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark deserves to think over him. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> The European champion in the wind power plants, of which takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of irregularities of the wind, which are the CO2 emissions and the Danish electricity prices higher by 65% and 50%, than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy will pay our neighbours electricity bill by 40% higher than the payment of French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor of competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would give rise to a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make with illusory beautiful declarations of re-industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The price that the vast majority of French people refuses to pay, as well as a general rule is not opposed to this energy, as polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remember that energy policy of our country to build the industry to 125,000 jobs directly and with 410,000 downstream jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Strong export sector dragging on international markets, a large number of small and medium-sized companies specialised in creating new jobs, which cannot be transferred abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France has decided to abandon the core, would sacrifice a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and she would have lost about 6 billion euros a year, of which country gets the export of nuclear facilities and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> The owner of the power plant that would have ordered a nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years, while it was planned bankruptcy, its producer? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In addressing the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic source for energy production, and that there is no evil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development of equipment producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group Areva is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the event of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducted a rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as over the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams whose professionalism is accepted, they have the idea of security in the blood. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> For fifty years recognized the nuclear industry three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only in the Three Mile Island occurred in the terms of normal operation and remained free of human casualties and the consequences for the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In the Chernobyl reactor and inexcusable drama caused the concept of human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some people forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident, just as it did in the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safeguards, operators and developers is that the type of reactor EPR is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While all the candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, he considered, stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be an excellent gift offered by competitors group Areva and EDF and release of the way for it to take a leading position in the nuclear development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate to find the best solution to the energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations have dominated the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration is a burden for the economy or the chance? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Immigration policy implemented in Nicolas Sarkozy has come under fire from various angles - the backlog of the police, the courts and the administration having been policy levels, the compatibility of this policy to the status of &quot;country of human rights,&quot; France says. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently it was administrative harassment, whose object were foreign students, which happened to the current, when Interior Minister (see the newspaper Libération from May 23) said that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But so far was rarely rozebírána at an angle of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> To say that in this area is fairly broad agreement between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> On the right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac in his statement that &quot;900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million migrant workers&quot; and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France &quot;cannot accept all the misery in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, was the fear of an invasion of Polish plumbers on French territory shared on both the right and the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In both camps immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and the French company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that uráčíme immigrants to provide. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme is François Hollande is limited to banalities, when indicates that the common development will solve our &quot;migration problem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in the elections, economically, but it is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> How&apos;s it look like economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím the latest knowledge on immigration (exceptional People: How Migration shaped Our World and Will define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 PP.): Between specialists there is broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants be adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Limiting immigration is crippling growth and harmful to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Concerns about the effects of the migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace the French workers, especially those less qualified, and create downward pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more than adding replacements for the French employees that they carry out the work in sectors with a shortage of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that don&apos;t attract the French employees, and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> The positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As a surgeon will have trouble with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of staff anesthesiologists and anesthetists, these additions between the French and the migrants make comings immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni peri so calculated that growth of migratory movements on the 1% will cause long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And it does not take into account the fact that diversity wafted immigrants contribute to the formation of the ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants between American holders of Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, micropayments companies like Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants are also in European countries net contributors social systems by an average of 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimated that in Germany, one immigrant arrived at the age of 30 years will bring in all his life in public budgets net contribution (revenue minus expenses) 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate, the desire to take missing percent growth &quot;with bared teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth used to deter immigrants have had the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, left to think about European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a rare and very fragile goods. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent would he should remember, however, that her in Athens two thousand years ago, he has seen during the world wars of the 20th century tragedy, totalitarian regimes of the Holocaust, the gulags, but also the Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some people may believe that to democracy has triumphed over their enemies, will be enough to carry out the election and implement it as the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> He knows, however, since Napoleon, that it was the ease of mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, even though it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may become &quot;an instrument of oppression&quot; as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: Public space, public spirit, the values of the organization department and control of the force, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just so, and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The mistakes of the Greek referendum type of yes-no will have in this regard, the value of double revelation: The discovery of the need for a return of political power, but also a sense of his inability of disturbing revelations, his doctors. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This must be promýšlena lie, so that it can be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front line of the democratic struggle to relocate today and that many of the Republican fighters already blazes in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> There&apos;s nothing we can get, if we require a series of national referendums held by necessity and in a disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank issued by European an absolute monarch or jump with bound feet into the void nationalist depths: What choice for citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we don&apos;t want the blade of a guillotine, but a common, a fully-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of selection and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> They are not the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - or, indeed, we already know where to stop - because of the crisis is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is, in fact, the whole of Europe bending to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, who suffer from their inability to and their lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is, in fact, the whole of Europe, which is on the international stage be humiliated. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Zneklidňujeme in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it&apos;s the whole of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty and with each one of its peoples. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> Urgent need to be returned to the proceedings of the European project of democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> As only together with the Europeans will be able to reduce their debt, get rid of the government&apos;s investment markets and prepare for the future. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Exit from the crisis will assume the decision at the European level, which will not be able to be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise he would have led us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After we have long fought against this proposal of Socialists and Jacques Delors, all today strongly demanding a European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Be it. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be the new folly and new cul-de-sac. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We need to take on a new stage of European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In order to obtain a Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;be&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> In the interests of the revolution could not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson is to continue. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> It will be able to carry out only by building Europe more politically democratic and a real European democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Let us become Europeans, in order to build a Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards are spreading </seg>
<seg id="2773"> In the optimistic atmosphere opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris World Fair of smart cards. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> 2011 should under the Cabinet Eurosmart end an increase in global sales of smart cards (bank cards, phone&apos;s SIM card) by 11% to more than 6 billion units. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> Most of the carrier&apos;s segment of contactless technology that allows you to pay in the public transport or to handle purchases by bringing the cards to the reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year should be sold around the world 460 million smart cards against 320 million sold a year earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their share in 2012 should still get (expected 580 million units) and to reach approximately 10% of the total market for chip cards (6,925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> After a long time in the wake of the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in the contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Approximately 26 million bank cards, Visa is already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals is accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France are more modest beginnings: Was issued 400,000 of contactless cards Visa. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But large commercial chains are working for two. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour so this year issued 2.5 million contactless cards Pass MasterCard. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> We put a higher gear, it should be that from now on banks by memories of their clients. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;The two big French companies have pledged to distribute systematically in the future-bank cards to its clients,&quot; announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> The banks are testing the payment of cell phone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But this is only the first stage of the payment device of the future: A cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Technology NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary for the implementation of the transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;Took the delay.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But their real expansion should take place in the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;For the year 2012 we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmartu. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks are already prepared in advance. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The bank Crédit Agricole yesterday announced it would launch test carried out in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with the authorising contactless payments. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And also the Société Générale yesterday announced that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its customers to pay the mobile phone bezdotykově. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> The terrorist Front ranges from the Sahara after Nigeria </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about links between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The long-term suspect that there are ties the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and Niger sect Boko Haram are confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, the undersecretary of the Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers on that from now on, &quot;sure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way both organizations are operating, and intelligence reports show that there is a great cooperation between them,&quot; he explained, without further explanation. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> It seems that Paris has a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help shed light on the bridges. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> After they were abducted by members of the AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, should be Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory of the following day killed at the same time as a number of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French troops. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble after the intervention of the French and Nigerian investigators had found several phones with chips belonging to terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> The terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> Analysis carried out by the call leads to a few persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to the radio station Radio France Internationale (RFI) in particular, investigators are interested in two numbers: One leads to Nigérijci, who long has resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and a second to the man, which is said to have close to AQMI and sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;It&apos;s progress, but it should be no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start to talk about the operational cooperation between the AQMI and Boko Haram.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that is increasingly more actively,&quot; gentle statements by Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months, these &quot;support&quot; more and more apparent in the development of Boko Haram and speeches or in its operational procedures, which include human victims from now or ever more sophisticated explosive devices the same method of execution, such as equipment used by AQMI. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community on the forehead with Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by the Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities, in fact, long regarded as a community group enlightened mystics little good interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Rapid success of </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around mosques, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusuf. Far Haram, which in the language of haoussa means &quot;Western education is sin&quot;, approved the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region has such a quick success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The sect politizuje and requires strict adherence to Islamic law šaria, while her supporters initiated the fight against &apos;central government. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> These people focus first on churches, bars and offices. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, the followers of Boko Haram become extremely active and multiplying their attacks against police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> As usual, the government&apos;s response is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army surrounded the city, and the result is 800 people dead. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Since then, the group radicalises and leave their posts in the north. </seg>

<seg id="2832"> Can America weakened the crisis to manage the world using simple, even simplistic ideas? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> While listening to the presidential candidates that voters might think. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repeat the strident statements and concise instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Often spurious slogans on China, Iran or aid to Israel among themselves to coalesce. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, preferably with umisťující candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, threatened by the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations &quot;due to manipulate their currency,&quot; which is the theme in America inflamed migration of entire parts of its industry toward Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> Worse, if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon huntsman, a former Obama&apos;s ambassador to China, and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost caught in the position that &quot;settling&quot; emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But huntsman, who is on the last places in the electoral estimates, remains neposlouchatelný. </seg>

<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current president say that Reagan was too simple ideas and still won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, a new entry port of Russian gas to Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> Long-distance the Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and held for the bottom of the Baltic Sea began work. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> They must deliver gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted this event due to celebrate. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests, among them four heads of state and government, the last Tuesday attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline, which under the sea directly linking Russia and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together control around the valve control entry of Russian gas to Western European networks. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> The new pipeline will begin to flow into Western Europe every year additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas pipeline on the length of the first 1 224 km linking the region of St. Petersburg, the Länder Mecklembursko-Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, an amount that is equal to the entire French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And already, recalls the chance to build the pipeline, third on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom is the timely completion of this huge building nature of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project strongly protested against Poland and the Baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> In fact, the Nord Stream pipeline to deliver gas directly to Germany without was conducted after the country of some third country (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> At the same time these two countries are losing a bit of power: The ability to push Russia by threatening to shut him access to Western European markets, is becoming more difficult for them. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Hard as it expressed the Warsaw, when she assimilated Nord Stream for &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot; with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Does it mean to say that it is a politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe through its support for the Russian project in it has gained greater certainty of their purchases. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is at the price of weakening Europe energy, because the project has created a rift between the Europeans from the east and the west. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has managed just five years ago to promote his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western nations with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are coming to an end. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, the new artery that connects us organically,&quot; François Fillon said at the opening of this gas pipeline and demonstrate, at which point they are big gas contracts things both political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom&apos;s leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, supply the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical offence. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> An undersea pipeline is made of steel and concrete shell, in order to protect from anchors naval vessels. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Lies at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> In its construction was necessary to avoid the mine fields dating from the period of the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Because of the safety of nearly a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,&quot; says Jens Mueller, a spokesman for the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It was necessary to also raise measures for the protection of flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffelovek, which at its full length is nowhere suspended or valves or repair stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> One control platform should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but project leader rejected it, when the Swedes were just a few greedy to see the Russian state company, how to permanently settle in their coast. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the case of failure to stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute,&quot; explains Jens Mueller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak in the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is builders considered unlikely, he welds was designed to leak occurred once every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> State control of the gas pipeline from the outside is carried out by an underwater robot-led ships, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled device, which circulates inside. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This device cigar-shaped by an average of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and she was being led by gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> In goal for three days at a speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information on possible distortions of metal parts. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> Long-distance gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the slightest correction. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> Circulation of the gas is simply ensured pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The value of this pressure is 200 bar on takeoff and 100 bar in goal. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> For the implementation of this project five companies joined forces. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Leading position remains of Gazprom, which holds a stake of 51%. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> It was joined by the German company E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> The company is based in the town of Zoug in Switzerland, where the tax is extremely beneficial. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom then this company rented for five years of the contract, which can be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will profit from a total capacity, whether it is the amount of gas transported in real terms any,&quot; explains Jens Mueller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline comes from 30% of shareholders and from 70% of the bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For a group of GDF Suez so investment costs rose to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are confident that they will return to their costs, because the risk of taking on only Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Pipeline is getting out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy beach with pine woods. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The valves high 15 feet is the exit gate of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas before it is shipped to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this terminal accepts every hour of one million cubic metres of Russian gas. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> It will be to achieve full capacity of 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Brand Moleskine notebook - </seg>
<seg id="2912"> The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, would once again provide the joy of writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of candles. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by their black rectangular plates and their leaves, dingy white colors as if time senescent. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> , Moleskine notebook, such as we know it today, was born in early 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company modo modo residing in Milan at the time, decides to market new designový, but distinguovaný notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the firm, is taking on the launch of a new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book was inspired by an old manufacturing technique &quot;moleskin&quot; (imitation leather), for example, which is used for the treatment of the surface of the benches. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of notebook was very much appreciated by writers and travelers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine returned to the popularity of old and forgotten subject, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, which has since become a leading figure in the brand with the company modo modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success is here. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010 increased sales by 26% to settled last year to 12.7 million pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> The situation is remote clandestine production of the early years, when it was made only 3 000 notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine exceeds the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to build an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the book will take a businessman as well as a student or professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> The image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are people cosmopolitan, sophisticated and open spirit. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian firm, which in its early days had 12 employees, today is almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> His notebooks circulate in bookstores and through the chain FNAC stores in small boutiques at the center of cities, where he could assert their identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We followed the spirit of the times and the need for new writing, despite the tumultuous development of e-mails,&quot; explains Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine notebook: The recently opened exhibition &quot;round&quot; where architects and artists put his notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno also introduced the new plates notebook like a leopard. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Moleskine, benefited from his success and this cultural aura and diversifying its products: Bags, diaries, pencils, notebooks... make extends to a wide range of media. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why is it such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Around 19% of the disabled people looking for work. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today, the opening 15. A week for the employment of the handicapped. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Over by pursuing a proactive public policy established in 2005 is the percentage of unemployed disabled people still two times higher than average, or 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It is depressing? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, underscores Éric BLANCHET, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, which organises Week for the employment of the handicapped.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress achieved in 15 years are remarkable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time, the percentage of unemployed not twice, but three times higher.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;However, there is still much to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> That is to say, for the unemployed handicapped persons remain numerous obstacles before they entered the work. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> This is an older person: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have low qualifications: 80% has graduated from high school and university students from 2.3 million is only 10 000 disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And finally - long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, those are the criteria that particularly complicated by the return to work and which constitute the core of the problem, &quot;according to Christian Grapina, the Director-General of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses to adopt handicapped workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So, in terms of the objective brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remaining neřečené, ways of thinking, which is sure to develop, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by IMS-entreprendre pour la Cité found that the respondents managers have &quot;weak level of knowledge on the disabled persons&quot; with &quot;excessive idea of persons in a wheelchair and psychological or mental deficiencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from that, in order to achieve the objectives to employ 6% of the disabled workers set out in the Act of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The last known figures, which come from the beginning of 2008, showing the status equal 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now we are moving around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of the Organisation Agefiph, responsible for the collection of fees from companies that do not comply with the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Evidence is a number of &quot;pokutovaných&quot; businesses, as well as the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 provinivších to companies to 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also demonstrates the real awareness, especially in large enterprises.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Labour only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 workers employs handicapped workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;What luck&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Before Tuesday night (20h45) invite the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens hiding pleasure, which would bring this friendly match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We won&apos;t go so far as to say that there was a conspiracy between them, but the figure is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting next to each other in the stands of the Stade de France, anyway Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the struggle against Turkey said Belgian coach to his players only words of praise. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I&apos;m with Eden and his progress very satisfied, even with the fact that he loves his country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to move forward,&quot; he assures player of the French Lille. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If this is the difference between his performance in club games and matches the national team, &quot;one and the same, justifies the.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;I&apos;m a year in Lille, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;It is necessary to purify their brand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Gambling, under investigation against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis, at last, &quot;beamed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> They cannot ignore the concept of &quot;joy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2970"> To play against the Bleus, which rallied from 7 years and in their victorious campaign in 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I&apos;ve always been a fan,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This necessarily contribute even more to the &quot;special&quot; nature of this meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> All the more so because, on the other hand, &quot;are (Mathieu Debuchy), Yohan Cabaye (), Adil Rami (),&quot; recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We were cruising the immediately.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;To play against them, it&apos;s just a pleasure!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Leekens said good-naturedly, &quot;pride.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; to fight &quot;game - holiday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; also noted in the quality of &quot;neighbors&quot; that France is a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African town of Knysna &quot;to become the team a very high level.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,&quot; rozdychtil. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, technical footballer would like to see in 2014 in a plane with the French direction... Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our little Belgians will become great,&quot; he underlined. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;That&apos;s something we are building, players are ambitious, have a healthy appetite.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;You realize that for the next matches.&quot; Including that against France. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal very self-confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento started with great optimism barrage against Bosnia Bosnie (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> On the way there by both teams lacked realism. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;At the end of the 90 minutes, we&apos;ll be happy team and, above all, a safe country.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento had already sees in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, which is at the helm from 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Portugal divided from luck in fact 90 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Left to play one game and one opponent - Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> Conscious of Friday&apos;s result (0-0) in the hell of the Bosnian Zenice seems clear that is not out of the woods yet. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal was surely more than an hour, but was not able to give such a rare goal, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;It&apos;s a good result, but it contains the risk, because we haven&apos;t given out góla.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisaboně are Portuguese believe that referred to in front of an audience that it should create a boiling pot, even if the game certainly appears to be a &quot;very balanced,&quot; says an optimist, but sharp-minded Bento. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We expect a very balanced game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand,&quot; said forty-two-year-old Portuguese coach. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;We still have a 50% chance to be at Euro 2012,&quot; said yet successor Carlos Queiroze. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Undecided Friday&apos;s game in Bosnia, forcing the Portuguese to score and win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Undecided game may be enough Bosnians who also need to score a goal. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;It&apos;s a good result, but it contains the risk, because we haven&apos;t given out góla&quot; regrets the bento. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We&apos;re going to play against a team that has a large technical quality and who has the players with big individual qualities,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> Just as in the Portuguese Zenici will have an interest to develop the Bosnian team right from the beginning of the maximum pressure so that &quot;did not give them time to think.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea, under the condition that this time proves to be realistic. </seg>
