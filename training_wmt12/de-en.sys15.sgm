<seg id="111"> Professional sportsmen to say a Stylist - also a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> Had gemeckert about, how Stylisten will be able, in introductory article, I have a bit that this was a bit to every substance for the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> When I guessed in any way which still is </seg>
<seg id="114"> To hear of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how this is the place. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It get, even worse: </seg>
<seg id="116"> Ever closer places of the examination, we are ahead so more of information and practical tasks. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But also when the way forward is taking on Saturdays, and on each, he nevertheless is documented fully. it privileges </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we discussed with Director Alena, how a madam attracts the not perfect proportionierte figure; </seg>
<seg id="119"> And these are still the majority of us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> There are those who have a neck on short, who else are a jungenhafte figure without other proper turns and once again mollig: </seg>
<seg id="121"> There is cause of Stylisten, at concealing look broad shoulders, numbers have been thrown about in an almost casual fashion and conjuring to extend the neck or the necessary trends. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got too, which gave multiple advice, how it attracts a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez, it was pretty, and figurbetont, without it works too provocatively, so great Busen, hip and narrow Taille </seg>
<seg id="123"> For example, the difference between Taille and hips will give out, it is so great, that of no suit coat, or the pair of trousers really, if itself schneidern to let it at least a piece for degree.. </seg>
<seg id="124"> It will not regret we undoubtedly, because well values to wear, is simply priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailor-made coat is committed it namely much better, than a of the piles, the tolerance extremely and verrutscht in the Taille absteht, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Jungenhafte characters to allow in turn, to bear clothes with Falten, Bauschen, applications, or Raffung. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In this lot am the information and Figurtypen, I welcome that I have a whole week time, as to let me all thoroughly by the head.. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And yet I have been afraid that there can not create almost, in the entrusted encouraging handovers is out - </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each Kursteilnehmerinnen was namely a Promi, for they devise appropriate Outfits. Tagesbekleidung and Abendrobe; </seg>
<seg id="130"> We are in the current appearance, the Modestil of the relevant stars and its Figurtyp to take into account. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I attract, Mr Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the campaign at the Victoria &apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Within I juble because this accounts for me to attract myself much better, as on such Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has increased I think in the last time in the 100 kilos, or even the young Selena Gomez.. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The clothes should ausschneiden to look we from magazines or Internet, ausdrucken working, and then grafisch. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In Moodboard, the entire result called is intended to come then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design expressed. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is very important to reflect also on the graphic side of Stylings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The Stylist namely prefers to the role models not just purely physically, but also more of the so-called Produktseite in the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="137"> From us tells of the Stylist and designers, Mr Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> In other words, a Stylist did a good overall picture. </seg>
<seg id="140"> Of Samstagsvortrag angefüllte, with information on Figurentypen has tinged right from three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> By Stylisten to Jan Pokorný, the fashion designers Jakub Polanka, and by Modefotograf Ben Renc. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub in Cairo reminded us to the fact that fashion illusion is and this is a Stylist to be able if, to exploit it as: </seg>
<seg id="143"> And eingeschickter Stylist can achieve to work with a single Bekleidungsstück on the whole in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word means of variability. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So we should bear the example, a Trenchcoat, as usual, on the jeans, so as a T-shirt or veil, we carry it also on the bare body, Absatzschuhe to do and contribute than clothing it. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It goes, to the sleeves or to the affect down and equally of the entire look suits very provides different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Play that, emphasised it. </seg>
<seg id="148"> At most I was the next council: first to her to know perfect to the rules. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Only you violate it, said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally I will be clearly, why we have all these theories we must pauken, what we can combine with what, and why, even if we must be seen often in Modejournalen quite else; </seg>
<seg id="151"> To mention the whole of Modeschauen. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographers, Ben, and I know that a Stylist is much to prepare more Bekleidungsvarianten as it, ultimately photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So it is preparing for a Fashion story with ten sides to the point, at least fifteen to stylen: </seg>
<seg id="154"> And it is also that the clothing on the photograph in combination looks with other accessories, sometimes very differently, than reality </seg>
<seg id="155"> With everything, must expect we therefore in the management of Outfits. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The fact that images and Styl sometimes account the half of success, which we confirmed also, Mr Jan Pokorný; </seg>
<seg id="157"> As it needs only just look at Madonna, not have just brilliant singer, from the image and marketing of a world star with respect, have made. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In Tschechien and is one of the services of a Stylisten to be rather striving. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Also know people often think it for wasted funds. </seg>
<seg id="160"> And when already is obtained from us are stylen it we should expect that then it imposes us with a large likelihood, a different size, when he then takes in actual fact.. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then you need to googlen then only, in order to establish, with safety, that the tabloid press writes that the appropriate Promi again fallen or etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario showed us on Sunday to draw, to believe that a Stylist itself must zusammenzubauen will focus on the fashion and just that outfit. there you are </seg>
<seg id="163"> In its work communication, he has much more to do with the people, which it stylt and it must be a gewiefter psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> The people einschätzen, without itself anzubiedern and his views. </seg>
<seg id="165"> If we to make any businesswoman also takes on management tasks, so to sift through their Kleiderschrank and to supplement about nice pieces, the situation will, we resolve the whole storage cupboard and hemp to my goodness, that is so terrible. </seg>
<seg id="166"> We at least must find a few worthy things, on which we should as be possible to bear to do, said Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It was also very specific, which so will contain a so-called Platztasche. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So as a pocket, who we zuknöpft on the Taille and in the people to all necessary Proprietäten in itself, which is </seg>
<seg id="169"> Apart from this clear terms, how the gap between Abroller on Haareentfernen or Sicherheitsnadeln, which does not contain it also such Utensilien as a Nylonfaden, of specific Clips, with which the cart before the clothing will be gerafft, if it is too great and obviously Nähzeug. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Please understand that we not must listen however only, but also somewhat in practice can try, have learned as one, taking off your shoes properly unterklebt. </seg>
<seg id="171"> In taking photographs, on Atelier, can damage the floor just is, where we have the Schuhsohle, out the much less. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Us oC klebten, and we klebten </seg>
<seg id="173"> With the one touch, the shoes not even so that we, they are not damaged. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Therefore we do really skilfully. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario, was very pleased by praising my creation without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The earlier great skill, namely not it is my great strength </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this, it was just the fraction of what we got on to hear in the case on second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Is one that is becoming I now clearly - is too to pay the Styling to professional level, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V Need, a natural person for Speed: the run for energy - the illegal race across the Americans </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> The original sorglose journey by one series completely of preventable dilettantischer mistake on Routinefahrt to Frühschicht. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It managed certainly, to meet the ambitions on large part, but what use already when obviously nobody wishes, a bit to do. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Already before he was the Ladentische, the new part, offering with the subtitles with the welcome turgidity expect a great deal. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Promised it yet, which have seemed old Spieleserie Need for Speed to restore a piece to be postponed in a new dimension and the spielbaren Demonstrationsbeispielen, it need to sein actually not only is one many Action-Rennspielen. the </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious how the eingepassten passages ausfallen, is rising in the Hauptprotagonist from the car and become to get a foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> However as it is used in NFS already, it is ultimately much differently, as we had expected the way; </seg>
<seg id="187"> Sure - potentially it quite is that the good Arkade-Rennen, but the game is compromised by some unnecessary mistakes, which are more or less already few years for present, in this series. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So really are no mistakes in a more rather sign principle can not keep laziness to the Spieleentwickler. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very good </seg>
<seg id="190"> Firstly we are imported in the history, which like to think of flag, has personal nature problems; the only solution seems to sein to participate at a illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In the San Francisco, so the west coast, is we came against the steering wheel, with the task, sein the first New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements; </seg>
<seg id="193"> The entire route has distributed in ten stages and longer, as 50 individual race. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It means that every race on other route will be conducted and that the individual stages in different sexes is sufficiently varying, and of interesting environment to take place </seg>
<seg id="195"> We offer no moment to give the impression that game would always again be same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are all to see even very nicely, even though the technical level of the graphic display is not more on the former parts of the series that on. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore not, the lay-out; </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the driving by means of the desert, by herbstliche landscape or highly high by profound verschneite landscape we visually very like: </seg>
<seg id="199"> It is sometimes again atypical elements that bring a little change in the individual race.. </seg>
<seg id="200"> The desert for example surprised of a Wüstensturm, the idea very restricts the point of view. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains, in turn to ensure it extremely carefully that we not will be verschüttet of an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Incidentally be incorporated into very good to cut the individual race.. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Only a few, but they are adequate. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a while, they are trying so to overtake the compulsory number of opponents, then has time of making up time, then a One personal international expecting with a single sides. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And he is intervening also still in the police, the one will vermasseln the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="206"> An innovation of voters, they are of the passages, in which Jack is leaving the car.. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Here it is more certain of interactive Animationen, should flee in those Jack before any someone and where the players are helping, when is it that the right button in right moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So not delude ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It surprises, however, that it is much less such of the passages in game, when would be entitled to expect it. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Ultimately it is the matter more for the benefit, because this element has a least do not stand a chance of boring to werden - it belongs which have been said in context for high on the elements, who to diversify to make the game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> To the Fahrmodell and lack in the Fußtapfen of previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> It means, by finally centre, although no trees, and on the other hand we say, it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If realistic simulations is seeking, itself are forced in other places. </seg>
<seg id="214"> However a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren, also the European Fahrmodell will continue quite well fair, although one better in the competition to find. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Meanwhile, it is as far as everything in the best order; </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems, have disappeared only after certain time. this </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the Fahrmodell, is the Kollisionsmodell not very essential K. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Of one game this type, calculated not to expect that it complicated Deformationen and collisions, but when it is practically before any impact on any one object idea, how the car is then obviously not all in order </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typical example throw light upon the close that did or Vorbeifahren on oncoming cars on some posts of the other car, only easily, in others, almost identical situation is however into arrows and centres headlong performance.. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or goes the Karre at scrap metal. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thank the Restart-Systems which makes out although not further, from annoying, it is finally for it. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Is the Restarts to resolve so: if we did write-off or far be absent of the line ends up, then the first, raises the game to the last point of reference of the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Just in each race was only of five Restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If we, it has been exhausted, is going all the right direction.. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The Restarts therefore rather is such a thing as a tool for the case that it does not succeed, but about should leave itself not and we would rather. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes helping not just of Restart, because helping not different, as to learn the critical section from their heads. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Very unpleasant, that the same things are often the same posts going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some trends that pass through it for example to the whole of specific kind and way, otherwise it fits simply. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere we will be further damaged in the relevant point of civil cars are always regardless in the same configuration, whether it comes as first or fifth or five seconds sooner or a minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> Which is particularly annoying in situations when we can see that the comes round opponent as far as we are concerned before a cars who is happily on two oncoming, however important, even there by it and slow down the cars already in such a position that they steered or need, I </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it is not when important people they and it is all designed the fact, for it is always close to this situation before your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The sides are still further advantages </seg>
<seg id="233"> In the whole game, there are a few posts, where we are always out of date to the same point by same opponents and also here again without consideration on the time: </seg>
<seg id="234"> To happen on Verrücktesten, for conclusion of the game on the long bridge, which we are counter. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opponent as far as we are concerned must be disturbing, overtaking a here seem to the devil to escape. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And it is then already sometimes before a, then he is a naturally adopted to the view, sodass it there are initially the own cars to travel a few time in Klump. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Be clear - we will make the game simply more exciting and aufregender, but this intention is vermiest so clearly, that they quickly have the pleasure on game.. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And that it is a pity, because despite einfacherem Fahrmodell, the game is also so aktionsgeladen as a whole is very entertaining and There has been a certain amount, for aware, almost we not more; which is the head, one; </seg>
<seg id="239"> And in principle is no matter, which is the blame to point - the concept with the 50 unique routes, the orders of the race on a way for that can raise no boredom, or rather quite different </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the Wagenwechsel in the course of the race; </seg>
<seg id="241"> We must not overlook it the petrol stations to the route, because just here there can change the car, although the most cases, the car is sufficient, which we has just. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The car divides in three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The prams are well appropriate, for the urban areas, the strong American brand for the draft of motorways and exotic Super-Sportwagen for the technical journeys, for example on the Serpentinen in mountain regions. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand and the way of the Spielgeschichte is also the Aufgaben-Modus - so, at the end of the day to the in the various hiring out, which it knows from the history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here, it is not just some medals, but also Erfahrungspunkte winning for the own profile, which work together for the tasks and the history is </seg>
<seg id="246"> In order to reach the higher Fahrerniveau, have caught up various objects: starting by cars, including to the Backgrounds for the profile, and so it is </seg>
<seg id="247"> That it is linked in parallel with the Online-Funktion Autolog, which provides its own achieved results are compared with those other players and also for further collective functions under other things. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One further incomprehensible Schnitzern has a situation in last race of the story </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here it is: the car in an underground rail tunnels, where rast as shadows on the railways that we have been. </seg>
<seg id="250"> On Tacho paragraphs looking between 150 b 200 kilometres per hour, but is suddenly of the cart before a metro and drive a uncompromising to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our text, we may still argue for long time about the fact that this was a blackout of Spielgestalter, or whether we think the authors for stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is no Überwältigendes but the visual overall picture is very attractive in most cases and here there even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Is all the more galling is that some exciting moments are of becoming the Bildwiederholfrequenz more slowly and it is sometimes quite tragic </seg>
<seg id="254"> This subject however, notably of the accidents with major number of parties concerned, in which a continuous FPS in any case nothing benefit. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The Tonwiedergabe is as far as O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache.. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In its endeavour, to raise a broad, as only possible scale, rather young audience, of a Soundtrack arose a lá of each something - but who buys such a game already because the music?! </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall impression of Need for Speed: the run for energy, &apos; the feelings are rather also true. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game, the aforementioned total unnecessary mistake, not diminished, we would be able to compete with the held conviction, for the run for energy is the best piece of NFS in the recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But so the game in some way does immature; </seg>
<seg id="260"> In itself, should be prepared for a one pleasure but we support to say that one such mistake with the Power sting of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eyes, and it </seg>

<seg id="277"> The Czechs did to the reputation of Negativisten and confidence </seg>
<seg id="278"> The Treaty of Lisbon means that one made the balance under the individual institutions from the track. </seg>
<seg id="279"> I would not expect that such a hard war is becoming.. </seg>
<seg id="280"> It will discuss five, six years are continuing to be until settling the dust and all in their new role itself have used, began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, very strongly to their presentation to the legal faculty.. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How is the motto seriously on Europe is understandable and open, they have demonstrated to be able we, on the first part of their speech, in which it managed it; the individual institutions describe of the EU, and their mutual relations on such a limited amounts and understandable way, the fact that it is so some Lektor of the legal faculty of the Karlsuniversität would therefore, and it </seg>
<seg id="282"> Madam Vicenová here praising also of the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> Initial criticism, was loud, he was too quietly - a grey official, the equal of such a role, but I have to say, it has up short all the efforts, as well it, for the matter itself was adopted. </seg>
<seg id="284"> He is human who it brings to deal, listening 27 Member States can wait idea, how to communicate with them, and the clear first everything from which has, as it should continue with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of high representative for stated Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then as a response on the issue: who is in fact - for the European Union I ring What the number? &apos;, so as an important step towards agreement and better readability of the EU &apos;s policy towards States, as, for example of China or India; </seg>
<seg id="286"> That anyone we ban our Ölmützer Quargel </seg>
<seg id="287"> Madam Vicenová devoted also of the agenda, under the subject of the European union was removed, living in the near future action to live. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency before two years described as success </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs had organised the financial crisis and the gas crisis to be successfully handled and also the summit for Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> It referred in the event of the government during the presidency as great Negativum, which the image, the Czech Republic was harmed much. am a bit worried that this may be meant to be &apos;procurement&apos; </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the European Union has now fully to do to all hands: </seg>
<seg id="292"> With the words, the ambassador of the situation, which it said not only in the chair, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not overcome to date still, rather in a state of panic; </seg>
<seg id="293"> And when adopted even the Sieben-Jahres-Budget to the EU, the matter because the today &apos;s economic situation is much more complicated, but they </seg>
<seg id="294"> That it will be a slim and rigour budget, the economic sectors received over the countries and what less to promote states - all this is now to the agenda </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador reminds also to their own slogan, with which they came after Brussels: to understand about Europe; </seg>
<seg id="296"> If I do not, we are gräuliche sWIFTs to contend, are not in their vocabulary and academic jargon has started, the nobody is quite clear. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How I know as citizens in fact, whether we are at Brussels really curly or round of cucumbers and different great bananas are invented just now, or whether we want to ban the person Quargel really. </seg>
<seg id="298"> You use the soil to the EU, even want this order to get more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe two or various speeds in prospect </seg>
<seg id="300"> Following opinion of the EU-Botschafterin are the Czechs in reputation Eurosceptics to sein more of the negative, as positive sides perceive the matter. </seg>
<seg id="301"> All the more galling is that the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> That many factors are responsible under other things, also the restraint of our candidate, whose inability to support is not especially to write Motivierungsbriefe and weak to the Czech side: </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the successful Czech presidencies, they emphasised the force and cooperation of the Visegrad-Gruppe, the so-called V4.. </seg>
<seg id="304"> Imagine me, when a Polish or Hungarian on me is, and a Slovaks in the close, then about together, the Frenchman in addition: he what it is when the heads, that is already back your V4 - and it is a rather cause acid face; </seg>
<seg id="305"> Madam Vicenové, according the EU expect in the future before all hard rules for the Budget-Politik of Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> And much reeller, which was when a European Federation does it on the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds.. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We here have the country in the zone and the countries to miss the Eurozone </seg>
<seg id="308"> We have Schengen area and we already have the institute of a bestärkten cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="309"> First time said that should only work together the countries, which it want and which should, which it do not want, could be absent; </seg>
<seg id="310"> More and more it will give these institutions, what will bring a strong Europe of the various speeds is based, expecting to Mrs Vicenová; </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respects they paid fulsome tribute, the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to be discussed all approaching matters with impact on the whole of the EU everyone of the Member States, on the high-tech, while just the countries of the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="312"> Fire means: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The Innovator IBM enters its existence into second century </seg>
<seg id="314"> Look after a suitable word that the strategy of IBM described on genauesten then, that the word &apos;long life cycles. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the broad public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it knows, although a modern companies, it has been his creation already a century is passed. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis that long life cycles already presented its first leader, the visionary, Thomas J. Watson sen. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already represented the slogan, with countless global problems would resolve easily, if people would be prepared, a little consideration in that respect: </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan, Think, was for trademark, about which the life of the future giants is if being struck. </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was also that the basis of the business culture, thoroughly prepared of Watsen. </seg>
<seg id="320"> For us does from IBM of this long-term thinking, a kontinuelle movement in direction future; </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived the earlier, and I was another reason why a whole century is successful, because it has remained its principles to be true and not zurückschreckte, to change all others among its neighbours; </seg>
<seg id="322"> It allowed to us, in the course of our first century, transforming the technologies, the business and also the society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope we are creating in the next one hundred years more, said Bishop Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from reason of the anniversary. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Thought-out system </seg>
<seg id="325"> The Watson carried social care of its workers in the 30 years - on the same way, how the entrepreneur Bata in the Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute were as one of the first American workers paid on holiday, an insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and have a thought-out Entlohnungssystem for better innovators and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As we are more sophisticated, the long-term relations of IBM and its customers </seg>
<seg id="327"> That companies choose of beginning to great in the Talentförderung and was accordingly to make. as first first companies, the world lifted to IBM of any discrimination </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie, it is also the current plan, the Palmisan to the head of IBM in next year of a woman is abgewechselt of Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Which is already for thirty years in IBM, so far, they adopted a position of Vetriebs-, marketing, and Strategiechefin. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM will make in the recent years &apos;Online-Brainstormings, that will accrue from those many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No miracle gives of ideas - it enough be at company, even working almost a half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Your firm &apos;s position on business guarantees to the company, a strong image and this following home, and after foreign. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Right from the start was IBM, rather the concept of an institution, and a mere Technologie-Unternehmens, on says Economist, the teacher of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> IBM does not technological companies will locate, but rather a company, the Geschäftsprobleme to resolve by means of technologies, has always fallen to add that George Colony, created by Consulting-Firma Forrester Congressional Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the companies themselves stressed, it is a difference to shape sein just present on the market or it by this presence directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> Called IBM in the States of their logo for familiär food, Big Blue, in a century to companies of the greatest one of the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> This is one of the vielseitigsten technological companies will locate at of Servern to the point on the nanotechnology.. IBM is developing systems, hardware and software infrastructure, Hosting and Konsultationsleistungen in a incredible Produktbreite </seg>
<seg id="339"> By all United States technological companies will locate IBM is an excellent one, the most staff already for five of its patents and have been achieved with the Nobel Peace Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> On his most famous inventions include Bankautomaten for example, diskette is also the buying of goods by means of credit cards, Finanzswap, or that. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With some $220 billion effrontery, IBM has been in this year of the second-largest technological companies will locate, which it took over for the first time since 1996 on Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The advance </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not to all products and innovations which met the taste of the customers of today - unfortunate for example of the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the Online-Service were Prodigy or the computers, IBM is bound to continue using PCs jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> Business is on the moving forward, therefore we tie emotionell to the past, believes this Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> That is why IBM has no problem, can be constructed of his ground on various platforms - and if they work, to leave it again. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to a rival of Microsoft, the idea does in principle with its operating system Windows or fall of proposal; </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technology </seg>
<seg id="348"> To the profits of IBM, participating services in great extent, educational software and hardware to each one fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> This more 1990 was representing hardware with a longer fünfzigprozentigem share on most. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Invested IBM bit profit abwerfende assets in value of dollar of 15 billion, veräußerte since 2000, in the same time, however 58 billion dollars in the shopping in sectors with a future technology. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In these Investionen, IBM, even after 2008 to travel continuing as the modern financial crisis on of the same name swept of a storm on the world for the first time as it. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Also here, IBM was the legacy of his first head of Thomas J. Watson in good, the greater its Investitionsumfang in the middle in the great world crisis. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Before, it would appear that the companies, IBM survives the today &apos;s crisis without prejudice. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of IBM-Aktien has increased raketenartig since 2008 to 120 per cent and the make a net profit of the company is growing kontinuell.. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The Unternehmensslogan of IBM is Everything does not just the values.. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also expected, that of this flexible giant which also must manage the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM-Geschichte: by Käseschneider to Weltallflügen </seg>
<seg id="358"> The IBM society that was set before a hundred years in New York, initially had very complicated behalf - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation: </seg>
<seg id="359"> The IBM behalf took it until 1924 - originally it was a mark for an establishment in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The cornerstone for future society, IBM has presented the merger of four companies, whose history to the 80er years, the nineteenth century goes; </seg>
<seg id="361"> You have had technologies as the example, the famous Stechkartenuhren on registration of the work begins, and endes. </seg>

<seg id="363"> And it has Flint of the leader of the Konkurrenzfirma, Thomas J. Watson took to ensure that it helped in the leadership of the company of this way. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This Leader then even made the founders of IBM in the shadows at Watson &apos;s ideas founded to date the unbesiegbare culture and identity of the company. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson, who chaired the company by 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, began as the name does with the production and the distribution of all possible machinery for the trade of Wurst-und Käseschneidern, including to individual funds. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The first four decades, where Watson, the company launched, he already granted their turnover on nine millions of dollars, and the companies expandierte gradually to all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so essential for the company that he sat whole forty years in Chefsessel, only then it was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under its leadership, which began IBM to work on the development of artificial intelligence and advanced, even the first Programmiersprache. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 60er years &apos;technician and computer have done to help of leading flights into space of IBM - of the NASA on Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 and the famous flight of the people on the Moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> In IBM were developed in years was established in 1964, the first Rechnerfamilie with the same Rechnerarchitektur - the number, IBM, the system by 360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> An example of PC, the idea came to a number of the Computer-Standard at that time in years in 1981 under the behalf, IBM 5150 on the markets. </seg>
<seg id="373"> 20 years later, IBM veräußerte its Rechnerproduktion to the Chinese society Lenovo, furthermore, however, they bought, one with the Konsultantenteil of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and increased this full whole in the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> Our strategy, the IBM who is paid in the last three years is the concept Smarter planet.. </seg>
<seg id="375"> There is the intention, using technologies on wise way in so far not even proposed the field, for example also improving the situation in transport and the Städteverwaltung, a path </seg>

<seg id="422"> Then you include also to the women, who are downright mad of them, as they aussehen. </seg>
<seg id="423"> That is not long ago, that you will go, but there are many men to respond allergic, when their Mrs constantly is over their appearance whinges.. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger sex is agreed - with rising frequencies of the complaints of the women are always unverträglicher. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and cleanliness on first point </seg>
<seg id="426"> There is a battle against windmills.. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Windows putzen on, open places, and the dust wischen scheuern, the endangering, and that at least twice in the week; </seg>

<seg id="433"> That attracts you are the old socks really always remain a times. </seg>
<seg id="434"> A nasses towel raises not simply on the floor, and it </seg>
<seg id="435"> If your partner, such a tirade is exposed, you must not be surprised, that it brings to the Palme that the environment </seg>
<seg id="436"> Clearly, this is not meant badly, they just want the everything, however, did its order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> If the men, this would know then the women perhaps did not so much around on the sidelines whingeing. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Klatsch and Tratsch </seg>
<seg id="439"> Some women welcome, and tratschen, because being getuschelt behind the back or even vilified or it is forging alliances. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women now sometimes are concentrated on relations, therefore they hecheln by happy such issues, as the example - who, where, where, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Well any of our women, a little harmless pursuit Klatsch and Tratsch was at camps. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand on heart - that is well all of women own. </seg>
<seg id="443"> It is however not too to confuse with Klatschtanten gross calibre, where nothing and nobody is sacred, probably every something to be sneezed at, which constitute in their environment and particularly, for Frauenkollektive, a considerable danger which; </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jágr, and Vorácek has brought to the Philadelphia with their Assistenzen on victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The Jaromír Jágr Eishockeystürmer did great proportion on 5:3 in Montagsspiel of NHL, with two Assistenzen - a victory of Philadelphia to the ice in Carolina and is this once again produktivster of Czech players in the NHL. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Benefit of the overview of the neununddreißigjährigen Eishockeystars was in two cases of Claude Giroux, which is still adding a assistance and the best play Matches declared. </seg>
<seg id="447"> To two Assistenzen in same game has been recorded also even, &apos;Jágr player Jakub Vorácek; </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jágr has said journalists after the game, he had Giroux to a great evening predictions; </seg>
<seg id="449"> Even before the game to say him that I him are now able to a Hattrick; </seg>
<seg id="450"> That I was somehow in feeling. </seg>
<seg id="451"> The point and again can not help such a feeling, said Jágr, following its action Giroux, reached one door already in the first shot across the Flyers, by </seg>
<seg id="452"> A bit later, was also the second right of a Czech trail; </seg>
<seg id="453"> Vorácek won before behind the floodgates of the Hurricanes of the Puck and presented it Talbot between the circles of the successful Maxim. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before which we blew our first third, reached to the Heimspieler of Patrick Dwyer, a Short-Hander, but the second third then again among the Flyers.. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux, and that was </seg>
<seg id="456"> In cooperation with Jágr, it has been reached to its third &apos;hits&apos;, and then Wayne Simmonds has drawn its shot on fourth door. </seg>
<seg id="457"> I adore it, play with him. </seg>
<seg id="458"> I will not say that he is the best player of the League, but certainly heard it the best of three, on giving Jágr of its Center. </seg>
<seg id="459"> I came in the life that I am playing to conclude my career with such a Eishockeyspieler together with him. </seg>
<seg id="460"> Which welcomes me huge. </seg>
<seg id="461"> I raise my game to I; </seg>
<seg id="462"> All the years in the NHL were a think players of their game on me and now turns um of to turn, schmunzelte Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina nor was involved to the tragedy by the &apos;hits&apos;, of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, from a Strafschuss shaping, was in our approach on a door. </seg>
<seg id="464"> But Matt Read prevented any further complication, in which he was in surfeit of two to combat successfully a; </seg>
<seg id="465"> An excellent agierte Pronger in our zone. </seg>
<seg id="466"> That he got off the Puck, I adopted the journey and was too distant amongst these groups. </seg>
<seg id="467"> I tried to take it and am glad that it worked, described Vorácek to the last right of the game from its point </seg>
<seg id="468"> This victory of Philadelphia set itself to the top of the eastern conference </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech Abwehrspieler of the Montreal Jaroslav Spacek impinged itself from the game against Buffalo and much, is very recent in the second by three because a violation on Oberkörper. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Of the Candiens büßten to know in addition &apos;s Beck, and also their leadership is a unverloren in Penalty-Schießen 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> The one hand, the Strafschüsse to transform Tomás Plekanec. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Over than the lost points, the trainers of the Heimmannschaft well schmerzten of high is absenteeism loss in the defensive, - the game they played only with five Abwehrspielern to the end </seg>
<seg id="473"> This is a bad idea. </seg>
<seg id="474"> The meeting played only with a single, experienced players on the end, the rest had young players; </seg>
<seg id="475"> But when not leaves of human rights, so that we must cope, stated Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> In every change have had a wave of attacks after the other and up against the nothing; </seg>
<seg id="477"> We rausbringen the game more simple to make, and the Puck from our thirds: </seg>
<seg id="478"> Here it was such as the reserves, said by K. Subban, of one of the Abwehrspieler to be indicated: </seg>
<seg id="479"> Bore Ondrej Pavelec vigorously rejected from thirty shots of Tampa Bay and the Czech Torhüter as crucial, for 5:2 - to defeat Winnipeg, for example </seg>
<seg id="480"> The gates of the jets which ended a series of five and lost this had five different, as regards defending. </seg>
<seg id="481"> To develop since the 1989 Reisepreise </seg>
<seg id="482"> Up until 1989, there were only five previous state travel agencies in the CSSR. Cedok, that CKM Rekrea, and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel sold at that time, especially just travelling in the socialist countries, in the west were then just of &apos;chosen&apos; ones. the </seg>
<seg id="484"> And so went the Czech tourists to the Baltic Sea, in the Soviet Union, after Bulgaria and Romania came the Black Sea and Hungary on the Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> One light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, as a result was allowed to travel one after Yugoslavia, then of Yugoslavia suggested a one of pro-western course, and so the travel for Yugoslavia is limited much. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of socialist time was travelling there, that it is not even allowed to citizens of eastern bloc freely in the framework of the Socialist country. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizens of the CSSR, for example to travel on an individual basis, after the Soviet Union Poland or even, then he needed to do a so-called Einladungsbrief, apart from that Individualreisen were not possible </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even then the travel and offered to travel in the West, then we had Red Cross has said that it is providing 7,000 tents and however very large queues in purchase to take or also in hot-water bottle from the travel, or have very good friends in travel at least. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Also as the matter or was not went long. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called Devisenzusage has given just politically reliable people - the others had not to travel even, with the condition for when the west </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czech currency was no free umtauschbare currency, without Devisenzusage there so would be impossible, to find the necessary funding for a journey in the West.. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The weither most Czechs therefore spent their holidays in domestic, not surprising, that the Czechs on many Wochenendhäuser and Datschen who were buying a habit which now continues until there. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The samtenen revolution of 1989 was followed by a Reiserevolution of Czechs on the feet. </seg>
<seg id="494"> And up the 1989 have a holiday of the degree of all things in the GDR or Bulgaria, the Czechs in last year spent by 4.5 million of their Auslandsferien in countries throughout World. </seg>
<seg id="495"> An enormous paradox which is aware, we are now even not more in itself, it is the fact that we could not travel in the current popular country that attracts tourists of the Czech Croatia by 1989 - absolutely, because it was the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Equally been lifted, the start of the 90er years of the last century on the Devisenpflicht in neighbouring Western European countries, which is a huge wave of Kurzbesuchen; especially after Vienna, Austria and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Tschechoslowaken were not received for a long time of their travel in the West easy sufficient, everyone, at least wanted have been a few days since it; </seg>
<seg id="498"> So the Czech tourist where travelling after Paris in Zelt in Park, who then would have to find the money for a shelter in hotel or a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature in foreign travel of Czechs was one with in preserves should be that the beer and dried sausage and vollgepackter boot, of </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was introducing the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - well, following decades of our tourist were able to shop the Western currency at last free and </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our level and it are also of the Durchschnittsgehälter for commitment, which einmündete in another important moment in 1997; </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thank the greater questions after visits after the 1997 travel agents began regularly prepare travel by charters, the air travel, thanks of the possibility of negotiating that, in comparison verbilligten incredibly to the past. </seg>
<seg id="503"> End to the 90er years, the Czechs with the USA exception, already devisenlosen payments with all this advanced country in the world, what made the trips still simple. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Came to a more interesting moment in the history of the post-samtenen travel in 2000, when the high demand of the first direct charter flight in an exotic country has been been treated so frostily - after Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since then to fly every direct Charter-Flugzeuge with Czech passengers in long distant sunny countries; in this year but we are directly from Tschechien 12 with exotic destinations; </seg>
<seg id="506"> At the 100 Tsd, Czechs travel annual in exotic countries, it </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in era, which marked our postrevolutionäre development, was 2008. in the year </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa for Czech of tourists, which we definitely under the most developed countries in the world is einreihte. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, the Czechs for the first time, spent more than the half of their holidays in foreign and first time in their history, they gave for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt, including the costs on holiday resort over 15 Tsd: CZK per its head on the basis; </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general meeting aims to find a new chairman - again threatens a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months for the Czech football is no chairman and this risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek on the tip of the Czech Football Association, not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk, will be known. </seg>
<seg id="512"> To this day: there still is no agreement on elected after any electoral rules. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And this is not to the vote on the three potential successor is possible. </seg>
<seg id="514"> The three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Trat June Hasek of returning its role, calling his colleague in like to do and has had to find a strong personality to agree itself and that the guided football in the future to the.. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only in the era that Hasek broke the old squabbles between the two Verbandskammern are once again the agreement on a common candidates. </seg>
<seg id="517"> That proved klipp and clear on 16 September, as the new chairman should be selected. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the general meetings came quite for nothing into Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov, the negotiation that led to no result and this was not only about the election itself </seg>
<seg id="519"> It namely could sometimes about agree who is actually entitled to in the Vollsammlung - civil servants, only the statutory representatives or the budget with a power also; </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this one point, reached it at least partially to agree, and to soften the recommendation of institute for state and justice, also, whose opinion was not permissible for a representation on Vollmachtbasis, the case. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The disputes at the electoral rules take however to continue. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The executive committee expressed not more clarity in the matter, in its meetings in principle, it is more the agenda at nothing else; no matter whether proper or extraordinary </seg>
<seg id="523"> Also if the views in terms that the election is reorganizing a few time - the key point was the same; </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question reads: How to proceed in the third round, to so avoid a stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> The bone of contention concerns the question, whether we should proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model to be found, was to note Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, represents in the management to the Profi-Fußball. </seg>
<seg id="526"> The satzungsmäßigem model takes a candidate in the third round anyone candidate, the greater prozentuelle support is given in the chamber, for he. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is supposedly prepared to respond on the compromise that the person who takes a candidate, the higher number of votes is given from two chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side in turn insists on the condition, the fact that the winner in this prozentuellen count at least receives a two-thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> Then to the two Vorrunden, have any point more, this modus would put the whole Zweikammerkonzept in question, understands not to angle events in Svoboda &apos;s objections of the Moravian side, which it would find best of the electoral rules, but too choose under valid statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Surprisingly the is voting on forward, even Tomás Paclík, even though emerging, for the with the nature of statutory electoral law of all candidates most think Pelta is </seg>
<seg id="531"> My wish is that it will be as far as possible, elected to do so under the statutes it: </seg>
<seg id="532"> Themselves abgrenzte that not absurd Ersatzvarianten will come out of his head is standing, as with the last general meeting, the owner said Victoria Plzen, the idea for the first time in his opinions before all Pelta and is taking towards it. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains however optimistic; </seg>
<seg id="534"> Its opinion that the new chairman is aware in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates are going to cooperate in the future also constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> The possible qualification of national team for the Euro today day would contribute sure to the minds.. </seg>
<seg id="536"> If the football, only on the euphoric wave ride them will also have the willingness on cooperation, which is greater, believes the official from Jablonec, the playing of the main experience of all three Adepten and this not only on professional, and regional level </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is there of moderate. </seg>
<seg id="538"> I look forward to an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately hypocritical. </seg>
<seg id="539"> It is not on the matter between the people from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia, but There are certain efforts, baseline figures, the rules on own purposes. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Is therefore not excluded to a fresh deadlock in the general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="541"> However, that ultimately win the healthy sense, I hope, who said Rajchl, and </seg>
<seg id="542"> But remains a lot of time for agreement of all sides - not more. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should become the horror supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows, whether the, will be absolutely complete, for Fußballgeneralität to Qualifikationsspiel, and for </seg>
<seg id="544"> To the Charterflugzeug, flying with the other Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, after Podgorice should have been in the morning in Prague for a technical disruption at all in order to launch, and so wanted it urgently after a Ersatzvariante, how bringing it is a part of the Executive Committee after the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Ultimately then after I think, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, which it should come supposedly on Wednesday, and it </seg>
<seg id="546"> Have been, the ministers for schools, youth and body as Dobes, the double parties within the greatest Sportverbands of the country like an agreement is moving. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Indeed it is a lot on the game. state benefits, of the Vertrauungswürdigkeit &apos;meeting of the Czech football and that the forthcoming is also the CSTV, which in the Czech sport is forward after the financial problems of Sazka to the new direction. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík is in the fight to position of the chairman, because it had not appropriate candidates of the matter is </seg>
<seg id="549"> When Tomás Paclík, the leader of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting to a strong candidate would be able, which represent, it meets all its ideas on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech republic of the way, would have been not entered into it is absolutely on the fight about these leaders. </seg>
<seg id="550"> If there were a good candidates, then, I would fight to abandon for it and to vote. this </seg>
<seg id="551"> But in the current situation has managed it not, to find such a Adepten, said Paclík CTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> Is the main reason for Paclík, going to set international with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, is to reach it is therefore to prevent that the alleged favourites of election, Pelta on the tip of the FACR.. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík is also emphasised that it will exercise the role of the chairman is only a year in the case of his victory does, by 2013, to the date of the proper general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position by the Chairman, he should like been to have seen a never get to know Top-Manager, of not too much, is else in the Fußballgeschehen, and </seg>
<seg id="555"> With some people coming in question, I was spoken personally; </seg>
<seg id="556"> Little to believe, that I have some said, wanted itself does not identify it currently with the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="557"> Such views to change like the time, led you want to it. </seg>
<seg id="558"> On most of all Paclík, allegedly disrupting the link Pelta &apos;s with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands, Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, is short of the scenes than powerful lobbyist, with the ability, to have an impact Delegiertenabstimmungen on general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta, the position of chairman. </seg>
<seg id="560"> In his victory, the current situation would forward einkonserviert in Czech football, first of all were: </seg>
<seg id="561"> The support by Berbr, would get a reply, a cleverem Businessman of the football is doubly badly, emphasised Paclík.. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Plays it also in this important, that Pelta &apos;s name before some time in connection with Telefonabhörungen was identifying in a Korruptionsaffaire, emerged however unpunished from the Pelta.. </seg>
<seg id="563"> I do not know which prestige a victory out by Pelta where football to table. </seg>
<seg id="564"> And what would we stand was said selling the observations of UEFA and FIFA in the view, rekl Paclík, whom shall its previous words, it the Pilsner Fußballklub, when Pelta chairman will however have been somewhat calmly. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Prevail Paclík in the Donnerstagwahl and could themselves present it however to a future cooperation with Pelta is entirely. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Also think including another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the general meeting in October supports, which was a fiasco.. </seg>
<seg id="567"> He is first to whom I would go. </seg>
<seg id="568"> That he has made a great skills.. </seg>
<seg id="569"> I imagine me his good example as leader of national team. </seg>
<seg id="570"> But I do not believe that it is able to lead the association as managers. </seg>
<seg id="571"> I is not to my nose, but in matters, of which I not understand, said Paclík, and the was made in September, for all it believe that he was behind the Abberufung of Schiedsrichterkommission with Ludek Macela on the top, the Dagmar Damková, it replaces. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík claims even that he is the role of Verbandsvorsitzenden. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And here on his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, remarking it is also to head of Pilsen, which was the first triumph with its support in May in League. </seg>
<seg id="574"> I have to contribute to change the power, somewhat in Fußballmilieu and too a certain cultivation of this.. </seg>
<seg id="575"> To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, which have a tendency to influence disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen which entails bis in front situations, led in Paclík, of no secret from its antipathy towards the example towards the Sparta-Chef, Daniel Kretínský makes </seg>
<seg id="576"> And one of its priorities, it would address the consolidation of relations between the FACR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee, with its aid in the political leaders for that it would lobbyieren, that more money from the Lotteriesteuer in the sport goes. </seg>
<seg id="577"> This is one of the crucial things which is, it should pay, the new chairman.. </seg>
<seg id="578"> When it comes to taxation Glückspielen, how the political parties declare that, then can understand I to their arguments, then, but it must tell also klipp, and clearly where the money are concerned, said he will be provided; </seg>
<seg id="579"> Its link to the Pilsner is not given to a club in the Paclík, also as a handicap, even though it even stresses the chairman of the FACR must, though, and </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta turn is linked with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> It is not just the ideal: </seg>
<seg id="582"> It is not in my opinion but also much sense, my shares in Pilsner, transferring a club is hypocritical on a Drittperson in order to return again after 18 months, asked Paclík clear </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statute of the FACR, the future ausschlössen a stalemate; </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days ago, the general meeting of Football Association promised one of the candidate for the Vorsitzendenamt, namely, Miroslav Pelta, he will make much in the case on his election for I greatly enjoyed drawing up this report; that the FACR of new Statute gets the involve sanctions to generate disagreement on the electoral law of the outset in the future.. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec is confident before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk and believes the election campaign will defuse sure in a possible success of the Czech choices. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta was promised even before the actual election in September, he wanted to focus in the case of his choice on the national team and the collection of financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="587"> First on the very last moment, is to participate in the election before the last general meetings and so it was perhaps to help the two-month break, presenting to defend its thinking on the leadership of the football and a broader context. this meat is </seg>
<seg id="588"> People to all levels are devoting the football, they are impatiently, and expect therefore that the chairman is known on tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id="589"> It feels that high time, and that the association of someone is led, about the man who is especially with the Jablonecer club, but was also many when Sparta and executive committee years. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Also why it believes that he have sufficient experience do make to be leading the Czech football, and </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is certain that it is the euphoria responsibility for the current problems with the election, which was a time of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> Unfortunately adopted in the general meetings in June &apos;statutes, which were not as completely, as it were all to be accepted - </seg>
<seg id="593"> If it does not allow different interpretations, we would have this September have a chairman, felt Pelta; </seg>
<seg id="594"> The revision of main document, the Bürgervereinigung used it as bait for the delegate. </seg>
<seg id="595"> That I should be the chairman, then I take me to this personal and prepared to bear personal responsibility, if it do not work. </seg>
<seg id="596"> This is a fundamental matter, without which it will be, says Pelta for. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In finally trying it, is to delimit towards its sides. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Previously announced it, he could imagine a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, which he recognises because its legal education and it well know that its Gegenkandidat would be his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Also Tomás Paclík intervened to it for a long time, not more, the case in turn was no dry to have picked up where it left off on Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In football, it moves already on a year and can already be some success, and that is </seg>
<seg id="601"> Its attacks were shocking but herabsetzend and that a lot of people were of its campaign. </seg>
<seg id="602"> And therefore to doubt now many to his real nature, addressed Pelta on his opponent, the well remain to be true to its Proklamierungen, which he already have expressed in September.. </seg>
<seg id="603"> He thinks that its strongest weapon is the knowledge of football of the lowest divisions, and even to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And should the advertisement of the Czech football - </seg>
<seg id="605"> I would like to make also therefore, to stop everyone Affairen - of the Causa Bohemians, and on the Nachhallen of the Korruptionsskandals by last year. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Equally after I would, I would bring to negotiate with the private companies and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football, said to the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate CTK before two months. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then also; he promised that his introduction in the tip of the Czech football means no human cleansing. </seg>
<seg id="608"> I should make only once to familiarise with the Arbeitsinhalt of all employees, he said to Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness, because the long anarchy. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, the forthcoming general meetings of vote, it believes that the delegates on Thursday are not for nothing, after Nymburk will go, and we </seg>
<seg id="610"> When really should the only controversial point as we will choose in the third round, then we come the fact across it. </seg>
<seg id="611"> The football needs back of credibility and which it is becoming the only way, if it has finally to come up with a new Leader, remains Pelta that there are two days before the, possibly crucial day of its Funktionärskarriere to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the FACR under beginning is to work his firm </seg>
<seg id="613"> That when the previous deputy chairman Jindrich Rajchl on the general meeting on Thursday on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech republic, should be elected, it would vermiesen this alleged many people in association of the whim, it is </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl is promised, the fact that we work hard in the case of his choice will start. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It will make system changes to introduce the members of the executive boards for individual Fußballbereiche responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Also, he promised to resolve the case Bohemians, improving the relationship to the UEFA and FIFA, continuing to bring more money in the football and otherwise the work, the previous chair Ivan Hasek has started. </seg>
<seg id="617"> As the Chairman, I will devote the football as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Starting by the international contact to the UEFA and FIFA, about the Nationalauswahl to the professional football, including on Leistungsfußball for the young people. </seg>
<seg id="619"> I will not say that, for its purpose alone, I everything; he said Rajchl in talks for CTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> I am distributing a Teamspieler and would therefore like the powers in executive committee as the fact that each member is devoting a certain area. </seg>
<seg id="621"> And distribute hard tasks, so that the football in every segment with Meilenschritten progress </seg>
<seg id="622"> We were many not just delighted, because they, should start, and not only to criticise the work of others, even to work really hard now, when he added to add it.. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Given the critical atmosphere in Fußballbewegung to be drawn in recital, at no longer to stand; </seg>
<seg id="624"> I is aware that I am working 20 hours on day. </seg>
<seg id="625"> But I must be aware, that there is the point and that people behind me, which I pose not, muzzling a stick between the ground and any step, I make to stand to provide in question, he said, as a statement, why he was hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Many people have said I, that I should not give up, because it would be done also otherwise to others. </seg>
<seg id="627"> This is confidence that we must not forfeit, he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Claim also motivate, dürfen the work to continue, which it has begun under Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> There are two years, we have to tackle a major piece of work and this will not throw away, I now is - </seg>
<seg id="630"> Have been launched to see stop processes, which may come only in a few years and I apply to be very reluctant, that they people, thought it, and bring now its concerns on an expression that the case for that would be elected - Miroslav Pelta of the other candidate, the situation in the times before Hasek is returning. </seg>
<seg id="631"> I believe that in systematic approach and it is a little, which Mirek Pelta not brings. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Behind him, there are above all people, which would make football, as the fact that he is only more for a chosen here. </seg>
<seg id="633"> I accuse it some, but that I would be biased. </seg>
<seg id="634"> I try me, objectively to sein; </seg>
<seg id="635"> Let me in football for all, because it goes all it well and is not only the select, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> It contradicts also of the assertion, he is just a chairman of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> Also if say some people to the opposite, I have to propose to do really to the best possible result for Moravia, and has, in some countries, even been reduced; </seg>
<seg id="638"> For example, it is the time to consider whether we should separate the League not in a Czech and a Moravian part, the winner then respectively in the first League aufstiegen. their </seg>
<seg id="639"> It could not happen it, that this three think Moravian clubs in the League play, which particularly is for the young players in Moravia, a problem, about Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because now also, the head of Pilsner club Tomás Paclík, the fight about the role of the chairman is supported, do the authorities hesitate itself not Rajchl, assess its opportunities, and that he is elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> I feel, a strong support in the Czech chamber, which is elected on her deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes behind my, has led Rajchl, also considers the saving of many tens of million crowns for unfortunate treaties, Fernsehverträgen and negotiations To the Lotteriegesetz as its success to the agreement of it. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Furthermore, it gives itself on part of the fault for the association on a single line, which has not one: </seg>
<seg id="643"> While it of Pelta states, he is disqualified from a priori, is to help the Czech football to new confidence, does it to the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate, the idea was offering the football really somewhat, of </seg>
<seg id="644"> Nobody to ask questions, the fact that it has done in Pilsen of the outstanding only one year work. </seg>
<seg id="645"> It should elect, then, it may continue the things, the Ivan Hasek has taken as well, would not change to the human occupation in the commissions that he obviously fundamentally; </seg>
<seg id="646"> He altered just the situation certainly not on his favour, expresses the Rajchl on its rivals. </seg>

<seg id="732"> Suited the building that was however neither space, and technically as Museum, no walls for hanging of the art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless it is being exploited as long time, the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house, and </seg>

<seg id="741"> For the implementation, was then Krischanitz the ideal person to work. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he has won to be restructured Joseph Olbrichs Secession of the sensitivity in Vienna and extended the competition because it, he studied in Schwanzer in the technical university in Vienna and the pavilion looks both back, it is an incredibly important place, in which he will have seen almost of the exhibitions of each weekend. </seg>

<seg id="744"> The current restructuring that it far was greater problems: the buildings was a Energieschleuder saying Krischanitz: </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Fensterprofile of the outside glass replacement, glasfaserverstärktes Isolierglas use and the Glasdach by particular safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Kältebrücken-Stahlträger should be replaced increasingly or made in this debate, while asbestgefüllte blankets to be cleaned and </seg>

<seg id="748"> The original Außentüren has remained the house to delete in old rotbraunen Rostschutz-Farbton. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the Kinosaal is even still very well, as it was before, and I would like to express my feelings in that regard; </seg>
<seg id="750"> And that everything under strict supervision to the Denkmalbehörde, and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Often had to find a material, which is good and cheap, and also the Denkmalschutzamt was pleased, saying out Krischanitz and highlights a abrasive, belligerent, soil in Untergeschoss.. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite constraints &apos;s problems and improvements to be made to the building, it is left with flexibility and easily. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Difficult it is to have been with the pavilion looks both back, than usual, from Brussels, has said Krischanitz from recent Committee &apos;s overall budget implementation, as well as the financial and administrative management; a typical Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte. and </seg>

<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck will arise perhaps still: the 21er house could receive to strengthen of a other Krischanitz-Bau, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin of temporary Kunsthalle, and how one hears, negotiating it already with the city about a neighbourly location in Swiss, the back garden, contributing as much </seg>

<seg id="826"> Did the murder to eight türkischstämmigen and Hellenic small businesses in the years from 2000 to 2006 of a right-wing background; </seg>
<seg id="827"> On this news response, in Turkey and the deutschtürkischen people in Germany, with fears and concern, and that </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because many Deutsch-türken in order, thereby a long totgeglaubtes spectre back: given in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May, since the violations of human rights in 1993, it is no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background to be against Turkish people. </seg>
<seg id="829"> It have this xenophobia in Germany, was nevertheless never in issue </seg>
<seg id="830"> That the rules there is an increase in racist network but reveals proportions whose dimension is still far from predictable. </seg>
<seg id="831"> That live the bloody ideology more? in its headline to the Internetausgabe of Turkish newspaper Haberturk, in other words </seg>
<seg id="832"> The Sabah newspaper on the other hand, emphasises that one of the perpetrators was a V-Mann of the Verfassungsschutzes, and is concerned that the German authorities in the extreme right-wing quagmire are involved. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Besonnen, responded the Turkish community of Germany: you reminded at the weekend with a vigil before the Brandenburger door on the victim of racist violence. </seg>
<seg id="834"> First two weeks previously had thought the Turkish community in Berlin to join with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the deutsch-türkischen Anwerbeabkommens. </seg>
<seg id="835"> In happy colours, the cooperation was been orchestrated - a history of success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> As a slap in the da effect in the report of some Turkish media: the German gift on Fünfzigsten states reported the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform Haber of X, the background of the series of it. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the Deutschlandausgabe to the Hürriyet leaves is not to take it, to draw this philosophical links. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It starts stinken, means the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> It stresses that human beings had been murdered, the taxes had paid with their work to an important contribution on reconstruction of Germany carried </seg>
<seg id="840"> Very critical to the actions of the police and their then Fahndungserfolg is being discussed in deutschtürkischen Internet forums. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why the Germany authorities have not been much to be either rather, to seek in right-wing circles following suspects, wonder the authors, the intention being </seg>
<seg id="842"> Some one has shown itself to be prepared at least a matter of rhetorical drastic means: here were done carelessly still, so the migrants still not choice as the self defence and the weapons. </seg>
<seg id="843"> That I will be the best reasons of self-protection: </seg>
<seg id="844"> Depends from a great deal of the internal peace in Germany of the quality of the enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the whole network, writes selenium. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What it means, if the internal peace in Germany in the risk, shows up the terrorist attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the early 1990 years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photograph of Brandruine of Solingen is enshrined deeply in German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> No other event was the living to telling Turkey more clearly, that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans and the fact that the suspicion and distance in right-wing violence can result. </seg>
<seg id="848"> Of the attacks but schärften the Wir-Gefühls on Turkish side; </seg>
<seg id="849"> Not repeat of the mistake of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> The Turkish press to function at the time, especially the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused, is to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> According to the attack of Solingen, he wrote a telegram of condolences on the Turkish President, was to take to be represented on the funeral takes place in Cologne, but of his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel. Mr Kinkel, one at the time in his speech, as have worked tirelessly many taxes of the local Turks, the work </seg>
<seg id="852"> Quite as berechne to look ahead to the value of a people for the level of its taxation delivery. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current reporting of Turkish press shows again even as profound, it is the mistrust of many Deutschtürken in the abandonment, the rule of law since then: </seg>
<seg id="854"> Apart from the efforts of considerable information and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, on this occasion needs open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The Skandalbank by Zürisee </seg>
<seg id="856"> The abenteuerlichste Bank Europe is not in Italy or France, but in the Switzerland </seg>
<seg id="857"> The of UBS had schlittert in the financial crisis of almost bankrupt and since then of a crisis in the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it should be a German to address. </seg>
<seg id="859"> As this thought Axel Weber, no doubt, and </seg>
<seg id="860"> Again after his spectacular departure, who was caught by the top of the Bundesbank in July, the fact that he would take to a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: Verwaltungsratspräsident to the Swiss Großbank of UBS - a unexpected and lucrative Karriereschritt. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was in public, praising Switzerland whether a matter covered their beauty and the of UBS, whether their new lessons in expenditure while guaranteeing sound and allowed kind remarks about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Who of UBS managed the Turnaround; </seg>
<seg id="863"> I look forward to the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger, and Oswald Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="864"> But already in September was clear that would come very different everything, including </seg>
<seg id="865"> One the of UBS traders, in London had been gambling found themselves all security system of the bank evasion and around the euro 1.7 billion; </seg>
<seg id="866"> UBS-Vorstandschef Oswald Grübel; a banker gerühmter do not only in the Switzerland, go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> Of the Verwaltungsratspräsident, the of UBS since then, is also a poor shape - and all &apos; when to play at Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already been aware that Weber are discussing the bank of February 2012 in that. </seg>
<seg id="869"> It already takes not, and the Verwaltungsratsvorsitz in May - only in 2013, how the bank told on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> The Union for Axel Weber will be severely one; </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not in other, but Ökonomieprofessor and Notenbanker, and would have to have had a Einarbeitungszeit of course need. </seg>
<seg id="872"> With a blow, it takes the responsibility for the strategy to a Bank, which has just once again demonstrated that they long deserves the title &apos;s largest Skandalbank of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because the of UBS schlittert one hand references are enormous and other for years of a scandal in the next, and recently it has the biggest asset managers of the world </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing seems, is spared of the once such pride of Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It began in the crisis.. </seg>
<seg id="876"> And 2007 which of UBS was an excellent reputation. this </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image was combined to express the suppressed and solid, but also ausgebufften of the Swiss Vermögensverwalters with ambitious objectives: you wanted in Investmentbanking to a huge number. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So the of UBS 2007, managed one hand with $1.6 billion to put more money vermögender customers than any other bank of world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And also they all huddle together as a Investmentbank in the league of the greatest banks of world.. </seg>
<seg id="880"> Which made it seems. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Of the former bankers and subsequent long-standing Bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans following to tell us: my students, along the of UBS at that time more as models of a good Bank. </seg>
<seg id="882"> From today view, asking itself am irren it, how could I just such that? </seg>
<seg id="883"> He wrongly are enormous. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007 was first obviously, for something should be bringing substantial schieflief in the of UBS.. </seg>
<seg id="885"> The middle of year was surprisingly done, Peter Wuffli, the idea in the meantime than hochintellektueller and equally genialer bankers applied. </seg>
<seg id="886"> Some months we guessed, why he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Investmentsparte of bank had been gambling found themselves with Subprime-Papieren and might as well forget about billion; </seg>
<seg id="888"> Saddled the of UBS, it has announced to a capital increase am saying in level of and schreibe to 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For they found investors, but what, on which some gerümpft, until briefly before of the nose even: one intransparenten Asian funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, the way was concealed that told you to his behalf not again, a concept </seg>
<seg id="890"> But this was only of the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008 and it was worse; </seg>
<seg id="892"> The Bank had known a new deplored, Verwaltungsratspräsident Marcel Ospel, management board nor the 2006 paid on zweitbesten Switzerland, was back </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 that was followed by the disaster: now embark on the of UBS was saved with their investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had the authorities.. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The Central Bank bought as from the of UBS for many tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs for a Zwangswandelanleihe, on which they will Miteigentümerin of the bank was </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole Switzerland was shocked too, because they said, how dramatically it is for a small country, if it so accommodates great banks. the </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally the balance of of UBS 2007 was more than five times so great, such as the Swiss economic performance. </seg>
<seg id="897"> Again, we will save the of UBS, said Bankenforscher following: </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first disaster closed itself to the second, and we </seg>
<seg id="899"> Already only a matter of months away to kapitulierte the of UBS, the main item on tax dispute with America and said that they are ready, adopting the data vermögender customer, which perhaps is evaded to the tune with aid of the bank tax were </seg>
<seg id="900"> Also it was a payment of dollars more than 780 millions - and the reimbursement of unjustified profits from this business and Strafaufschlag. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus the of UBS was acknowledged longer or less openly, to help in the tax evasion. - </seg>
<seg id="902"> While they lost something, which has been always been since their capital in competition about rich customers: the Nimbus of secrecy; </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was not more the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> There was the resignation of CEO and Verwaltungsratspräsident.. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of Kundengeldern; </seg>
<seg id="906"> As the Bank in the space of a few months lost its credibility in both key portfolios: in Investmentbanking, the Fehlspekulationen in the asset management by the aid on tax evasion, which is </seg>
<seg id="907"> And it as was again somewhat calmer, just as it was under the impression, now the of UBS intend to establish it once again, since item is this unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual of traders verzockt euro 1.7 billion, before the bank can see that rather going wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it will obviously: using the risk management in Investmentbanking, it does obviously always still. </seg>
<seg id="909"> With the Adoboli, did to see it that the risk control is changed too little, says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanzprofessor on banking institution of the University Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also of the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is certain: the problem of UBS is that they not has the risk control in control. </seg>
<seg id="911"> In it, but precisely which has been the idea to the caution, with the Swiss bankers before long time set out, werden the guardian of the great assets of the world: no excessive risk was perhaps to collapse for security for money, in other words: also beyond the Alpenrepublik in the world. </seg>
<seg id="912"> To the Tresore of the Swiss banks were the emblem for unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli is particularly noble of chocolate, and </seg>
<seg id="913"> The centre of of UBS in Zurich does still on the classic dichotomy of excellent Swiss, one, it is rather just a greater </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already, the situation is classic, I believe </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its headquarters in the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, who directly made by Hauptbahnhof from the Zürichsee leads, the aims to the schneebedeckten summits, the Swiss mountains, in order </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings are here prunkvoll, the Ladenmieten are the highest in Europe; </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers, as Tiffany &apos;s, it does here between Swiss Traditionsgeschäften like the Confiserie Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Since centuries stay here to follow the example of the Swiss banks: elite of the Central Bank on the palace to the Credit Suisse and to private banks, such as Julius Pooh. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The Empfangssaal, the of UBS govern it by a serious Drehtür.. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside of the walls are marmorverkleidet, before there are thick Ledersessel alongside the Bank-Logo, a major by placing a sign in their regarding safe. There are calculations to </seg>
<seg id="921"> The of UBS am aware, what is the customer to look here: security </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss bank beef both Swiss banks, of UBS and the Credit Suisse, but at some point - or as well as betraying how taken of the leader of a small Swiss, one. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name to read it rather in the newspaper, he makes finally, as all Swiss financier, also with the two big banks to do business.. </seg>
<seg id="924"> To the of UBS if much too great, it will - especially in Investmentbanking, where is a sigh of the Anglo-Saxons also; </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss people would have to say there no more. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And when surely they are adapted long of the customs of the Anglo-Saxons. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Actually it was the Anglo-Saxon Investmentbanking, that of UBS changed it only high profits, and then now fear, the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in Subprime-Dschungel, like the Swiss Großbank.. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent </seg>
<seg id="929"> On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation, writes the author Lukas hässig in his book of UBS-Crash. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion agreed the politician, not to save about which before the failed under Großbank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How possible is coming it To this end; </seg>
<seg id="932"> We talk, with Swiss bankers, they see the problem before all the size of the of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998 two, the three of Switzerland banks closed itself cooperating on a huge group.. </seg>
<seg id="934"> It arose of a bank, which was great already in the merger to the small Switzerland - and further increased. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped, that supplemented the two different Vorläufer-Banken of UBS: internationalisierte to have a rich but verschlafene bank with the emphasis of asset management in Zurich, and a poorer, but already more. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the internationalised Investmentbanker came good to a lot money, with which they could revolve a huge wheels. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names have linked with this promotion of UBS: Peter Wuffli from 2001 to 2007, company himself of of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, who was then the chairman of the Administrative Board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> I was thinking always, Wuffli and Ospel were a Traumteam, says Bankenforscher Hans following. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Hochintellektuelle to the Wuffli and Bescheidene, and the deal of models and statistics is clear, and Ospel, the Bauchmensch, comes the top heraufgearbeitet of the Banklehre by one. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel have left to the conclusion on Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli have made the end, probably a decisive mistake: he was thinking, his models are the reality, says following. </seg>
<seg id="942"> This is a tragic case </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps.. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Is clear: an excess came before the case; </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of the of UBS will remember themselves clearly to the Führungskräfte-Meetings, on which company himself Wuffli who was living the same slogan more again: Goldman Sachs made in the throne of opinion; </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful Investmentbank earth, with </seg>
<seg id="947"> You led the League Tables, the rankings, which documented to the success of the banks at that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then the of UBS want that very above. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps you have achieved already. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In Devisengeschäft and Aktienhandel that they quite above played; </seg>
<seg id="951"> Unternehmensberater, which were responsible, stressed out however, a weakness: in the International Zinsgeschäft, in the Fixed Income Bankersprache, if there is an enormous gap to the main banks: </seg>
<seg id="952"> Which of UBS did gaps in American Hypothekenprodukten.. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, when it went of UBS in a venture, which they took the existence almost.. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Are hungry for growth, both the bank to invest even when also a gegründeter place before their Hedgefonds in American Subprime-Anlagen.. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It has developed to a huge machine, verpackte the securities to the American mortgage credit and Presidency - it retained also own risks however. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also more, as other banks for a long time, trying the withdrawal, a </seg>
<seg id="957"> In summer 2007, when it was the American property in flames, has bought the of UBS where, who says Bankenexperte following. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So great to the euphoria, as deeply the case; </seg>
<seg id="959"> A managers after the others to go when away the attempts were more difficult as intended. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Posts in the of UBS have been so far today unsound to be used as a weapon and. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Anyone who leads the Großbank now, did an almost impossible job.. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He will find a strategy to a bank, all obvious business models are abhandengekommen. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bankenforscher Geiger has already one idea: finally with the Investmentbanking to focus on the asset management to return to the Swiss origin.. </seg>
<seg id="964"> As far the bank while going: </seg>
<seg id="965"> However, the Investmentbanking is gradually dwindling to be giving an enormous, so much is now already obvious </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, the new Bankchef of Sergio Ermotti will imagine the world of its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 - year-old Italo-Schweizer was thought only as a temporary measure, when the bank surprise of predecessor Grübel is separated. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Now, it is enforced: he should lead permanently, the shops of the of UBS, have been told with the Zurich Bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants limit the Investmentbank on the state in the middle of the early 1990 years. </seg>
<seg id="970"> It has cut 3500 authorities.. </seg>
<seg id="971"> It in a state of wealth but it. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The of UBS need a vision in this respect </seg>
<seg id="973"> If it; </seg>
<seg id="974"> And earn it of money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> There are the issues, which itself represents Axel Weber will already. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly he has to say only, it are looking only with its Mrs, once of a home in Zurich. </seg>

<seg id="1532"> Walls did eyes: how researchers would see on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before it has been on the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, has been by Anders Behring Breivik but one of many boys, which of their Anti-Einwanderungsmeinung online sendete. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday was Breivik, the has been stood, committed to haben in a killing spree in Norway in July, when the 77 people were killed, the first public hearing before Court. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik may alone be traded, it is not far from being alone in Cyberspace: </seg>
<seg id="1536"> Following the tragedy to this past summer of researchers more find on these people.. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But as we find it </seg>
<seg id="1538"> That is easy, as we have seen page just in Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> We have found that not difficult, to come too them, said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent, published report of the British Ideenfabrik DEMOS on the digital populism in European </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks of playing hide-and-seek of personal information is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett, that the researchers simply need to use the Werbetool of the side, so exactly to set their desired demographic data, with scientific accuracy - as it retailers for years are doing, I am also sure that you </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team found a half of a million fans of extreme right-wing groups throughout Europe and visierte they will use Adds, but instead to verlinken with a new bond or a new Diätprodukt, invited an which Adds users on a survey, was needed in those following on her educational level, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Because Facebook were to leave us more than 10 000 supporters Bartlett and his colleagues, in the situation to question of 14, extremely at the right party in 11 European countries - without that they have only once in their office, too. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> It is fairly new research method, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Certain of the results surprised hardly; Online-Förderer of extreme right wing groups are often young, male and very frustrated on the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> However in a way it is a striking distortion of those who remain who their Online-Aktivismus combine with a Offline-Aktivismus appears wiser, more democratic and less violent than those which sit behind their Computerbildschirmen. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> DEMOs work is a example as Facebook to be a new hot tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Ideenfabriken, and medical researcher and political analysts are using the side, in order to study everything of health issues and even on Gesellschaftstrends, as in Likes, text and Statusaktualisierungen. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Working with more than 800 million users, who add the content on average of three per day, Datensupernova of a Forschungsboom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side increase in the title in the last five years to almost 800% of Facebooks. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> To achieve some researchers for the good thing of Facebook to the fact that we are studying people by this side, which we normally with his Clipboard on the road.. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> When you used to trying to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult, identifying it, in connection with </seg>
<seg id="1551"> You initially had granted the party information and the would have these never entering, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> In Facebook which find all - you are directly on them; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Else saying that the side provides a possibility, and of the need to solve social health problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A current study discovered of Dr Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues Megan, of students who their Vollrausch discussed on Facebook, significantly more on Problemtrinken tend as student, which remained silent on this issue.. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno proposes, that equal students should supervise the side for example Wohnberater of a students and if these many Statusaktualisierungen postet. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> You can not solve that this may be a problem, if you not have recognised, said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development on Children &apos;s Research institutes in Seattle, the Washington post office. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> We have found a possibility, of identifying vulnerable children, which otherwise found a parent - </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook would also constantly zapft of the data of its own people. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The Datenteam of hand has drafted the statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentinstag, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a National Glücksindex </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Yet to the users of Facebook will know that the side to monitor it whether they want now or, order is to können allow one winter crops of the hand, the own personal data.. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook Part of a survey, of who they have not yet, there is something to know; </seg>
<seg id="1562"> When researchers have strict set directives, how they collect their data offline, is allowed on line everything. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> I do not believe that many users even on the fact, on reflection, that a researchers study their profiles, says Neil Selwyn, a social analyst on London Knowledge Lab, a study from the 2006 in he looked at the public sides on Facebook of students.. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> What it affects, it was just their and their true friends </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the issue of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Itself offline there are no guarantee does, that a Forschungsteilnehmer is absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook but does to know it impossible as a lot of the data in a Nutzerprofil and in contributions to be true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> What is saying on Facebook and what makes one of Facebook, outside, radically different things, says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore thinks Selwyn, despite its years as Technologieforscher, a Clipboard and a pen that you have still always, that they are the best Forschungswerkzeuge, which all can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> There is no substitute for talking to go in the real world and with real people, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Social research concerned to the social and a lot of social life is still offline; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Cold and inhumane, seems in other Breivik Behring, on first time before a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Otherwise described Breivik of the man, the idea has frankly two Amokläufe, that were killed in the proposal in this summer in Norway 77 people, Behring even out in his first appearance against a public court in Oslo as a resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> I am of a Militärkommandeur in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Tempelritter Norway, he said before a court with more than 500 human </seg>
<seg id="1575"> I am making to appeal against the court as you have received your mandate of organisations, the Hassideologien to support and this being followed by the multiculturalism to be supported. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> I recognise, the laws, but I must admit I am not guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judges in Torkjel Nesheim, the umpteenth Breivik, during this monologue, because he not wanted to give Breivik to the possibility, use this hearing as a platform, on the, he can get to impose its own views on matters to express. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> The same reason that he have denied Breivik, the mitbrachte a first written speech, the permission on the end of the hearing to the families of its too address victims.. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered, that the police Breivik for 12 other few weeks in pre-trial detention reserves, it has four weeks, no access on the media. he said, that the authorities monitoring all missions and the whole of correspondence on eight weeks exactly. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Some 30 survivors and members of victims were taking in the hearings. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some people came in the hope to see the view to können Breivik in others, did the confirmation that he is behind castle and end still. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All attended the objective that all amounts on a Wegschließen. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> I was thinking, it affects cold and inhumane, telling a of survivors of Utoya to the Norwegian channel NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> Unpleasant, but me is further of a piece, having heard the suspects of view and the level. it has been </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik in producing a dark suit and a blue ties and mark a departure during the whole hearing and quietly professionally. he has looked of journalists and survivors in the eyes, when he was the building and again left to this. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breiviks bizarrem comments, he would form part of an greater resistance movement, came the judges to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that it would not demonstrate in favour, it would have had the complicity. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is certain, that the attacks by 22 of July, seemingly has the work of individual extremists and not this group of a radical. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this is facilitating automatically of the distress and the confusion, a whole nation or always there? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> I wish he would, as a monster, however it does it is not said the members of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> It is so much more easily, if it it would do. </seg>

<seg id="1753"> He said, is a failure of the Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung, what will lead to a so-called seizure, which would lead to 23% of overall cuts and a halt of many new projects. </seg>

<seg id="1766"> Whether Panettas letter and new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise will increase in budget or demands, will provide a further boost to the Pentagon of cuts to exclude, it remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta is increasingly bluntly spoken of the possible cuts, even though it need to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and white House, before he was the tip of the Pentagons, and I know that he stands to the grave decisions. </seg>

<seg id="2093"> We have disappointed so far are needed to haben. do we, a friend is still well with Bruce and Greg, who were building the band with us, for this. when I understand a song or the photographs do, I think, what, for an incredible human Andy, and as it I expressed the laughter: that it was always a pleasure, going to talk together to problems, and on music and football, and many other issues. </seg>

<seg id="2107"> When I am reflecting me are the band, which I first mentioned for Mudhoney, Soundgarden everyone Nirvana, and the arising same time to it. if they, are also still important, I think this great, because it is worth hearing this music and bands as Mudhoney account now better music as the earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> Initially their music was darker, now it is more positive.. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> They have been able to do so </seg>
<seg id="2110"> That it is interesting because I believe there is a few Songs on the new album, the something could work lightly.. but there are also other songs as of the End, or just Breathe, which will be classified as very dark Songs, although they also somewhat positive in itself have the year </seg>
<seg id="2111"> On two, I had the tears, when I was listening as Ed, they played, it are very at the same time as dark Songs; </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe, if you will longer and more drastic in your life happens it are your artistic creation, and your music, and these two Songs it clearly supported me, for example, when one loses a families or a friend </seg>

<seg id="2177"> The owner said of the discotheque to point that, made the Hausbesetzer of its unfair competition, because they sell the drinks to all three Euro, when the principal of this Euro in the disco of 10: </seg>
<seg id="2178"> Also of the owner of the Freizeitlokals is appropriate of the neighbours because Ruhestörung, while according to its statement of the noise, not of the visitors herrührte of the Disko, but of the Hausbesetzern and particularly of the guests of the festivities were organised there, and were always more and longer following statements of the disgruntled neighbours in the last few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The responsibility of discotheque and said to pay to müssen that the harassment was so great, that they came with the owners of the building in agreement, for the last nine months not in rent. </seg>

<seg id="2181"> The chairman of the PP is on municipal councillor precisely, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week, of getting immediately to remove the building and the problems of the civil coexistence and the Herunterkommen of the Stadtviertels in the control. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> He stated, that occupying before the summer is only a floor of the building, but that the were reaching Hausbesetzer in the last few months in all to put the building and almost all living. in certain, it has come even on burglary. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense, added it to the fact that it is necessary, incisively to set the impunity to an end and to combat the asozialen acts in the building. </seg>

<seg id="2188"> The architect in addition by quarrels on the professional fees with the tender in agreement </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban tender on 16 gates that gives the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona on new. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Middle of 1980er years published, the culmination of meantime disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona of those administration to their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described to the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He compared even in figures with the Central park of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> The sinking of CMB in year in 1987 of the park in the view was many to restore to ceiling of Barcelona because the capital city of Catalonia one to the few, which do not spread in time, but after the top and down.. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification of Collserolas and natural park plays with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> An example was not more of the Central park but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of Yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far There was as the city that he was in September, a Riesenausschreibung from 16 competitions, for another Zugangstore after Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Certainly one door correctly highlights to the concept of parks. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either is it the case or someone has, on country to the challenge. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question arises of themselves: Collserola, Park or Berg do </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The call for tenders is the subject for discussion in mouths of architects from Barcelona, not only from organisational point of view, but also in relation to a reflection on the city. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is already almost a rekurrentes issue, on which two members of this old eingesessenen caste, which itself are meeting in a lift, are able to resort. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it is precisely this fact will offer the substance for one of the rare consensus between the various governments, which think three architects from the Barcelona about, and some university who have to be advertised on the project, as </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán; Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the call for tenders is appropriate; </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán that it is necessary to speak to the attack on the coast on the front on mountains, as far as the debate by Ildefons Cerda, is being fought on green apples, and </seg>
<seg id="2205"> We take the principle that precisely the utmost park is of beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is well accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more as a function of the architect, for the door of Collserola title involves a lexikalische case in we must not imagine it as access on a park, but as the definition of areas on which we need to act. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol how Roldán and Bayona use of high-quality public experience, quite the proposal as a intellectual challenge, the certain dangers, which poses itself. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risks resulting from the uncertainty, who brings the creation of a public area today with following the experience from the 1980er for years, which were their swan-song in the field of the forum. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the limit on what must be developed to be. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> Something is to limit always, to set the next step, that means it to exceed. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> We must think, on new urban planning tools, because the present, lead to a genuine disaster.. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol, the more closely the issue is, about it simplifies, the side of Collserola, which is in the direction of Vallesana, can understand as a park, in the direction of Barcelona, not, and for purely topografischen reasons: </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol reminds, that it already have a study by employers, Mr de Collserola, which face on deaf ears, even though it is the council is stepping grateful, for it has given his body to the possibility, this project from the first moment to be involved. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> He realises also, that the vicinity of mountain life on city in the Geleitbrief is the enabling of the architects, to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubt, which will determine whether the technical profile, guiding the multidisciplinary teams created into lives, we rather should only be a tool, at </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona indicates that the answer on the question in the title of this article is complex, when the tender conditions of a global vision of Collserola at the moment: it tender 16 competitions in cross-section, he says, on the axis Gebirge-Meer. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> It has held at least in his case to the Council, that it is participating in the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the programme to some conflict and the definition of a project for a door with the architect of the Tors in addition. </seg>

<seg id="2268"> You shall direct Social Security Institution Mexico for a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, which support of specialists of the IPN. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Announced to the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social IMSS - that it is a research project to a discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the Title Genetics, leading a preventive measure for obesity in children and youth of people, to which the genetic Marker is associated with obesity to be found; </seg>
<seg id="2270"> The words of Miguel Cruz López, the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica on the clinic hospital to the de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that a multidisciplinary team, made up from doctors, has established nurses, Ernährungsspezialisten and social workers; </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team will support of specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs on Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The people invited to the participation in the study. interested parties can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in valley of Mexico, where any Saturday from 8 unanimous p.m. tests, will be carried out with children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He emphasised, that the study on the sports of Cuauhtémoc, which began for the 8 October on the sports of Nezahualcóyolt is continuing. </seg>

<seg id="2275"> He said, the objective of the study is the knowledge of the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronischer degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The global day of diabetes, he said, it will seek that 3000 children and young people in the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under the supervision of their parents ernährungsbezogene questionnaires should fill. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You put, also needs questions on their physical activity and their domestic Krankheitsvorgeschichte, so to control risk factors, the diabetes or Niereninsuffizienz result could have the return of used plastic bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> That he has led desweiteren, the fact that the aforementioned opens on Saturdays of the Untersuchungspersonen, controlled in their blood pressure and Blutwerte is measured to be determined, like the Glukosespiegel Triglyceride Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors, it.. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López said that this investigation be carried out at the concerns of the Gesundheitspersonals on the alarming weight gain of young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> The Gesundheitsumfragen arose from the years in 1999 and 2006, in less than six years have increased of the proportion of contribution boys about 77% and the girls at 47% with obesity, the incidence also the obesity has risen dramatically, emphasised to the specialist of IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> It was acceptable that the search for genetic markers is justified, because the genetic history of population of Mexico by the other peoples unterschiede. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> It was acceptable that a Mexican people have an average on 65% was indianisch-amerikanischer on 30 per cent of European and 5 per cent of African origin, which itself reflects in the genes, which are with diabetes and are overweight in the context, it. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> Very generally stated, he is the genetic make-up of the obesity would say itself from the inability, burn the surplus to the energy that we shall have the prospect, and sodass that in form of fat stocks stand. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers said of the direct benefit for the Untersuchungsteilnehmer would be a comprehensive investigation of the children, when the said would be this one degree of obesity or obesity product. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even it would be investigated to the incidence by dark Hautfalten in neck and on Innenarm, the less attention, the chance of Stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes in the preliminary stage on that, that. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All information in confidence were informed and the parents in writing to start from the doctors. the doctors will tell these issues for fear of the parents, all results of the measures and they are proposing the amendments of the way of life, which are appropriate to the prevention of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López said there are three fundamental factors, which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic disease: just, that states of a lack of movement in their daily lives, which is to be used to spend more time of the day before the television and transport, going instead brief ways to feet. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high Kalorienaufnahme that means that a greater consumption on gezuckerten drinks, and total carbohydrate, together with a high amounts of fat and Eiweißaufnahme and the genetics, which should analyse in this research project. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Step off the tarmac of the UNAM verhindert Schlaglöcher </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, develops researchers on the faculty for chemistry to the Mexican university UNAM with Polymeren in a modified form Asphalte, so to make the ingredients become more robust to climatic conditions and variations in temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> That would respect on the sign which start by Straßenbelag, who would be not, it need, to repair nearly 200000 Schlaglöcher, if the rainy season in Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México breaks out, says Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher on the School for chemical, with the university UNAM, also, and assured that when the adoption placing and the maintenance of the Asphaltbelags is properly that considerably in need, the number of Schlaglöcher or even fully will avoid. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his presentation Schlaglöcher, both from a technical point of view, he considered, on the occasion of the international year on chemicals, he was aware that the laboratory for which it is responsible, is developing into modified Asphalte with Polymeren, in order to establish the asphalt with the same mixture, which however has a greater mechanical resistance, both in high and also in low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extreme hot climate, how countries of the north of the cities in certain such being spent, so to improve the behaviour of the road surface is, avoid, the incidence of Schlaglöchern. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He said, that the asphalt is a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung, of who is a part of a high Molekulargewicht and the other part is a low - which is so these Malthene, the most serious part of oil the so-called Asphaltene </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Means Zähelastisches actions of Asphalts, this in high temperatures of almost 180 °C as a flow is the situation, in 120 °C very is zähflüssig, and 50 °C is almost while he will be fragile in much low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> But does a day in accordance of the weather and temperature fluctuations, led out of the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> Of the researchers, the FQ said, the road of Mexico City, a majority would have a flexible Straßenbelag, itself zusammensetze from six Materialschichten, of which the last three asphalt involved. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the classes, a Verschleißschicht lies, for asphalt, who would insist from small, gebadeten in asphalt and then hardened stones. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Every single piece of these Verschleißschicht, was been with all my clothes on, being in asphalt, which is </seg>
<seg id="2300"> When the vehicles must to proceed, and forces produced, this class allows a good Kräfteverteilung in Straßenbelag. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it, would be amended asphalt, the forces would become to distribute even better, thought the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> On the Verschleißschicht, it has led, will be interpreted to a final layer, who is so this Tragschicht, which is from tiny stones, that is from sand the was also with all my clothes on, being in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Given this class in contacts with the car tyres, must produce it is a greater mechanical force as the Verschleißschicht and they must friction.. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Which receives of these Straßenbelag of the most forces and to some extent; the Tragschicht is being distributed, is required to keep an appropriate thickness and the material, from where they is also.. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather has said in particular water and temperature changes, are other, important, too taken into account factors, first of all things to the water, he because there does the behaviour of Verschleißschicht is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the premises is as wet, as a matter of urgency of water in the class and is as just difficult once again, that causes a relaxing of sections of the road surface is, and consequently, the emergence of Schlaglöchern. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If a Schlagloch, he said, will be flattened to begin the Deckschicht, while the Verschleißschicht will only then affect.. however, the damage is emerging not immediately, but it is a process, in the first signs by appropriate Wartungsprogramme should be kept. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The members of the Council Sistema Nacional de Investigadores said that the Fahrzeuglast is another important cause for the incidence of Schlaglöchern. therefore had the thickness of any class of the road surface is, always, there are regarding Fahrzeuglast in the relationship and it must be ensured, that for preventing it will be complied with this regulation of frequent Schlaglöchern.. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera had to point that even many research on waiting for example on Asphaltemulsionen, which are in other countries, even on the market, and with which the Schlaglöcher, simple and not applying themselves on water purification of high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What lacked the candidate, del Valle, so to sein to the new Miss World Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of factors, the fact sector, Melina Ramírez Serna, not received the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle receives its 14 th Misstitel. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again Valle del Cauca was empty in the allocation of Crown for Miss World Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time to give to Melina Ramírez Serna is satisfied, too for standing up on the Gewinnerpodium, a Silberkrone and the bond, that they and new Miss World Colombia &apos;s eviction, is to put on show. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With which this night is committed as a result in Cartagena, where Miss World Atlántico adopted the crown and the cedar, something of themselves, is the Departamento at 14 Misstitel and Melina is heightened on the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which the crown had kept, almost in the hands of manufacturing waste, the stated Misses part: Rose Miriam Ospina Benoit, Clara Domínguez Borrero, Patricia Bellini Ayala, Lorena Álvarez, Mary Alzate, Mrs Olga María Arenas, Leila Blanque, Mónica Evers, María Consuela Pinedo, Diana Isabel Romero, Giselle Garcés Aljure, Catalina Giraldo and Stephanie Garcés Aljure. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The great question who now can constitute a lot, is as lacking? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the results is the decline of a large Favoritin, who had shown in any trial that they had on everything, in order to sein the new Miss World Colombia. not be for nothing, it was elected on Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, Title, which also received the Schönheitsköniginnen Taliana Vargas and the case with Natalia Navarro, and the crown of Miss World Colombia is increased with following House.. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor who applies as crucial, should be developed for the decision of the jury, the appointment for the first Miss, is that it has the answer on the question book What will most be influenced, and why? it was asked of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, not convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the author: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> I have read a lot, I believe quite to the literature, I believe, it is a kind more civilised to take, I believe ultimately that the book which shaped for my children are most, ` the small Prince &apos;, is a very very complex book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Currently I read &apos;fault and expiation within programmes. There is a book to be undertaken by the universal culture, which should read we; I read just to a paper of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, to a beautiful book, the ` way &apos;, in other words. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> An answer which has itself civilise to little think firstly because the term &apos;and secondly because they not specifically said, influenced of each book of their mentioned be based on the way it, in the course of </seg>
<seg id="2323"> However after the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina said, is to feel calm and happy to the result: the universe that is wise, it will happen, which needs to be done. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And everyone people: lest I ask a little bit ` the small prince &apos;. it is great to promote books; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Under other things being said, that the Liebling ausgebrannt of El Valle; </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Indicated and had the other candidates of making jealously, stresste what the Queen people who are therefore of stage could not shine. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And realised you in its first idea in Badeanzug on beach of the Hilton Hotel, and its two lifts in the Krönungsfeier.. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although they appeared sure in two, it surely was missing the force and the impetus, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did to being broadcast. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme as the direction casa when Channel felt RCN that the fact shows, that Melina for Miss World has been crowned with the fact that the candidate has been nominated, which is gaining during the competition of the most prices, not, will surely her finally.. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle was the closure of the press from the way - a mistake to make. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince for the social work of the Jurie on their interest, what ultimately is the most important thing of national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It already is his reason, that two days before the compilation of international jury covers Lucy Doughty, said it sought a woman who is committed for the social affairs of country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> Beauty alone is for a Miss World Colombia. we must look beyond to focus on the Körperliche and the social perception, it is the fact that it has worked already before the participation on competition on projects, said them </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is speculation also, that Valle was sinned with their faults of the Derriere and the Fibrose, which it said in the Magengegend of tackling it, being; but it is a contradiction that it has selected because the jury as candidate for ` natural beauty &apos;with a healthy bodies, good in eating habits and good physical work; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Put some fact that Melina was not the best body that it better existed, but their problem with the Fibrose on gut, which was said to be honest to say for me little, the coach of the Königinnen, Jorge Hernán Orozco, to their marks on the last day. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile, the journalist to Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is the view, the fault of the madam from Valle del Cauca if the surgical intervention, which they had subjected itself, on this. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> The operations they are OK, Valle was aware, as they are making it is right. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Your body never is to have their strong side, they have to pay, and take this opportunity, at </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because this prices, the idea of the first time to grant the national beauty contest, came about after the appearance in Badeanzug of a cruel forecasts, which it should be, in the night. it has getuschelt of the word, so that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, so not in the from the crown they is coming; </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Regardless whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is now on not of their Herrschaftsjahr, certainly as Queen, but as Princess, a position, which it offers the possibility, of representing to the appointment of the national beauty contest of Colombia in one of the international game shows. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But they will do as one of the Königinnen, the idea was escaped of the crown, despite their overwhelming speech for Cartagena, in the history eingehen. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So has the work of the doctors, the identified to the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> To a Lophoskopist from Cali, as did a men, of Alfonso Cano identified in the history.. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The workings of these officials to play a key role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On past, 4 of November, one Lophoskopist of fraud investigation unit of the public prosecutor was from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC confirmed, a &apos; Alfonso Cano by the purpose of comparing the fingerprints, and this </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven Lophoskopisten, the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González looked, a man from Puerto Tejada participates since 21 years in criminal investigation procedures of this. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> To the beginning of its career González was working in communities of Chocó, where he often have five days for itself had to go in the jungle, so to achieve the place, in which the bodies were that he should identify to that. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> 2000 as he, when following Valle on following the completion of the necessary courses it specialized is on Lophoskopie, that is the investigation of the skin, the friction is exposed, that is the pieces of baggage and Fußflächen.. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week, the efforts against the so-called Alfonso Cano, it was mentioned Eliazar to the fact, put clothes for a minimum of three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> It was expecting rather much. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> This Friday night was rounded up in helicopters of Palmira after Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He was aware that it will identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that a which can, for both men, which led the ältestes Guerrilla of the world, the therefore he should take away the Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Achieved it however with the Untersuchungste and the place, on which the body found was not to identify it by its physical appearance, because this similar, not to the pictures he seen in the media, in the slightest. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no time, it was dressed up like a farmer of the area, took no glasses and was very much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprint are full of lies do not </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with one to examine ink of a Pflanzkelle and have obtained verglich Eliazar fingerprints of the body with which it. on the Abdruckblatt </seg>
<seg id="2357"> It saw rightly, it was Alfonso Cano; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Even had the same night of this man and Gypsy from Puerto Tejada &apos;s responsibility to inform the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to ensure that it was actually about the leader of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> On Spurensuche </seg>
<seg id="2360"> To a Daktyloskopen, the Sijín in Cali was the recognition, which will be the idea that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González on a press conference on the use against Cano to give the allowed, very importance </seg>
<seg id="2361"> That many people know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> I have to say that the Daktyloskopie is a precise science without error, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a crime.. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten does not just identify bodies, they also support an investigation in accusations of murder and Raubsachen and confirm the identity of those people, and they account </seg>
<seg id="2364"> In their arrest many criminals attach wrong identity papers, or they do not have the year </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We have taken from the fingerprints and are looking in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researchers told to us, that it will shatter a piece wall in a theft from a House, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly to take this opportunity with its hands, when he herauszog a safe full gestopften with jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The walls are difficult, that their Oberflächen for the reduction of fingerprints are inappropriate. however in this case that we were the studying of the whole hands and the criminals, the was attended to several burglary, identifying that in Cairo reminded it, we </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Using the fingerprints also on Mordverdächtige to take the pressure or it. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently, a death surrounded of spirit bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Suspected in the investigation that a family member could be tatverdächtig, and actually a fingerprint voted to the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> When this is being brought, not guaranteed, that it are about the murderer as it, but with the place, the crime was committed, in context, and </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist of CTI said, for the fact of fingerprints with chemicals or physical Reagenzen by object. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If it appears, a Pflanzkelle is used or a bond for carriage; </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Then, the prints will be sent to get Asif, which is the Verbrecherdatenbank, or coming Personenstandamt. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> The problem that there are still many Colombians without documents, said the expert by CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> It felt, not all, or so, as it is presented in the TV-Serie SCI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As such as it can not do everything, it is the gold, what be able to make its aspect of which is to fix, as also not all, as we touches turns a fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> It can use, however, however, when we will implement a relevant comparison. </seg>

<seg id="2393"> The mayors defended personally of the evacuation in morgengrauen, conducted of the Zuccotti-Platzes, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and the was decided, because the demonstrators against the right was violated. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg said, he had given the order to evacuation of the place, because itself had transformed this in a place to the people, not for Demonstrieren, but on what may legislation and certain cases, so to wreak other people damaging because some business have received threats and the local residents bangten about to their quality of life; </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policies: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts will prevail on dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Does a subject that not treated to grassroots of short-term considerations or due emotions, it is this certainly of energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and the expense to influence directly of electricity Mae of the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the enterprises; </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to take a Wahltreffen on Anlasse, thinking on this issue and the position of the nuclear energy.. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate only to bear fruits, if they are the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The Frenchman should they think to have an objective evidence, the rational data fundieren; </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although itself, there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution that drives forward to a doubling of the Elektrizitätsnachfrage by years in 2050, should not have to abandon a huge share of the world &apos;s population to a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Also we must alleviate the shortage, the fossil resources, so still consistently produce electricity without the urgent necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to forget to a subject verschwundenes from the environmental debate, so against climatic Unregelmäigkeiten when, as </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accidents of Fukushima change not of this parameter.. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> That is why Germany blebt to isolate still in its decision, to give up on nuclear power.. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> That this is intended not of the case in Belgium, that is surrendering its decision, the need, to find a substitutionsfähige Ersatzquelle, still in the Switzerland, which just ever more frequent; only to build nuclear plants of the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Grobritannien, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Holland, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, so to name just to some states, are following their projects but will continue with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States for its part decision after Fukushima, they have been channelled to a new unity, by they are taking after the nuclear accident, redundant work Three Mile Iceland, once again in operating this Park.. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Also if this renewable sources, along, the German model on occasions as a model, based on the one hand and so goes against the reality to the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The elections in Berlin will be addressing in the form of prices of the Elektrizitätspreises, a detriment of energy dependence in particular Russia of closer by the high use on Importgas, an increase in the carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power stations niederschlagen.. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> The entirety that this unfortunate effects will do already within the course of a few months to impact. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case, Denmark is a cause for reflection. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is in part of European Tabellenführer on wind energy from it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand of the country is used to be one of the most users of coal and gas, it in turns to put up with wind energy; Aufgrunddessen, its CO2-Ausstösse and its Elektrizitätspreis respectively about 65% and 50% higher than the appropriate European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> The consistency of energy policy of our neighbours pay a budgets to French in the other hand to our 40% of higher Elektrizitätsrechnung; </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Given the price of the global economy to a key role, which represents of the competitiveness and a Stabilitätspfand of the industry on national soil, the französichen companies have given the most favourable electricity in Europe is a advantage </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Any significant reduction on nuclear power and therefore to draw a strong increase in Energiepreises for itself, what the noble statement on the Council to channel these remaining funds that will, in our countries and the defence of purchasing power on illusion liesse. in writing </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The surveys showed, for which is a price, is prepared as little to pay the groe majority of French, how it demonstrates to resist against the principle of this energy source. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Remember we to us, that the energy of our country has made it possible, develop a industry with 125.00 jobs inferred of direct and 410.000: </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Their strong Exportcharakters does it a whole host specialised small and medium-sized company on the international markets and makes these jobs to the architects of countless, something </seg>
<seg id="2701"> Take France of the decision, from the nuclear power to leave as being spoilt where to fall a Groteil of these SME victim, and the annual 6 billions were EUR on Investitionsgüter- and Kernenergieexport and more, one being </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Which take electricians to entrust a EPR developed on functioning on 60 years, when the decline is inevitable of its producers? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Give to resolve to the energy of the equation, we and the fact that it is also little such as a is the work of the devil, a panacea for production of electricity. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The developing out of the Areva company; low-carbon solutions for use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the Komplementarität of energy sources </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Is to maintain the highest possible level of safety for the nuclear power is a absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a safety authority, the uncompromising and transparent control in existing works as the construction in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Their Arbeitsteams, who have made a name because their professionalism, enough of the Sicherheitsvorstellung it is precisely too. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Within 50 years, the nuclear industry was three of serious accidents - </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only a single, namely in Three Mile Iceland, is supported in normal operating conditions; as he was without the consequences for people and the environment: </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In the Chernobyl disaster, the tragedy was created by Reaktorkonstruktion and unendschuldbares, human failure.. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> When Fukushima seems some forgetting, and that the accident of two natural disasters has never seen before either Ausmasses has been caused, which causes the deaths of several tens of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry to draw their lessons also from this accident, how they have done after the two previous, this of them. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Is a fruit to this approach and a cooperation of safety authorities to the French and German operators and manufacturers of nuclear power stations, the EPR to draw up a draft, the resistance towards this phenomena; </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Because it considers as desirable in the Elektrotechnikern building, a nuclear power station, and so an ending in Flamanville would be a fabelhaftes gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, by one liesse free rail to give them, reissen the leadership in the inevitable Kernkraftentwicklung in itself.. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is absolutely essential and legitimate to seek for the best Energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible of emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber that dominate considerations have a debate to allow the equally economic, social and financial situation of country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is that of immigration burden or opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration heads under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised for many corners - of congestion of police, of judicial procedure and administration because one of the figures &apos;submissive policy, reconciling this policy with the status of a country in the human rights, how itself had betitelt France even: </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently, the harassment aimed against foreign students of official side had characterised the Wochenschauen, the Home Affairs announced it must be said, for Frankreichkeine talents, bricklayers or waiters from the outside world was necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> However, these policy was rarely by economic point to be studied. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> On this issue, there is a far-reaching consensus between rights and left.. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Of the right hand, the tone adopted by Jacques Chirac, the was said in 1976, dass900 of, 000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million problems of workers, no problem for a country should represent, of left-wing side, by Michel Rocard, the idea was set out in 1990; Frankreichkönne, not aufnehmen the whole of poor people of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference in degree Grozügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear from invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005, both from the right, and from the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> By both camps, the immigration as burden is perceived for the Economic and the French society.. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference in extent of the Grozügigkeit, is to admit it to the immigrants &apos;s desire. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> François limited Hollande in his programme on trivial considerations, which must draw your attention, the partnership development would like it to resolve unsereMigrationsprobleme. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as burden, as a problem, can affect perhaps on the elections; however, it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> In existence, how are the economists for Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent, published work look, which is the latest knowledge of its duration on the immigration under the specialists, a broad consensus on the positive impact of flood of on economic growth, in wages and jobs in the to which they are migrating, it. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The immigration damaging to restrict the growth now and the employment, and it </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The concerns with the influence, the migrants are based on the idea that this risk of the local labour, particularly the small qualified, to find substitutes by they exercised to put pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The experience shows, however, that the immigrants in truth are much complementary as the local Lohnarbeiter, since they ausüben schwerpunktmäig professions in sectors, which are arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet.. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low skilled immigration to work in sectors, the indigenous Lohnarbeiter, not do the qualifizierteren under the immigrants work in dynamic sectors, in which the training not is aligned to the offer of work. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive Lohneffekt </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Also as a surgeon, has meant difficulties that would try to work in one country, in which a lack in Anästhesisten, so these Komplementarität between locals and immigrants in a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and national employment situation. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Does a miteinbezogene, herbeiführe; </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And that not the light of the fact that the diversity tabled of the immigrants is the Ideenschöpfung, and the economic growth to benefit. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants will also contribute a net transfer to the social systems, in the European countries, on average, around in a level of 1% of overall budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The Weltarbeitsorganisation estimates for example, the fact that a person einwandernde in age of 30 year after Germany, the public budget in an average on its life to a net contribution of the 150 Euro return. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted in bringing the teeth of the lack Schnittpunktemit to our appointment of his mandate. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> This question with teeth, the immigrants should deter, reached however exactly the opposite effect.. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe to invent the democracy now, to reflect the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy, is a valuable asset; another sensitive asset </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent to remind itself because who their invention in Athens, it is more than 2000 years the whole 20 century on the tragedy of the first World War, the totalitarianism of the Holocaustes, of the Gulag, but also of Franco, in Spain, Salazars, to undergo in Portugal and Oberste in Greece on itself and </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Several members believed well, it is quite sufficient, voting rights to exercise and to direktest possible and so so be the winners to see the democracy of a concerning of their enemies for all time, the possibilities </seg>
<seg id="2745"> People know since Napoleondem small ones that it was about a feature of the state of mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The general right to vote the necessary condition of democracy, is not to be this sufficient condition and can equally well zumUnterdrückungsinstrument, as it then put the Republican philosopher of Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, Democracy requires much more: a public area to take a public spirit, the values, a organisation, and control of the powers, a training, and education, of economic and social spirit of a body of law. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe where we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also very much and first of all political and democratic crisis, not. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The attitude of Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums would have twice insightful nature in this respect: </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambiguity considers as obsolete. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today are to be transferred, and that the republican soldiers or majority at least of them, not more in the right direction that were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have not to win, in order to press to a success of the national referendum, which was organised in dependence of the needs and perverse order, but </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A Freischein for European dictator or a leap with its eyes in the void of nationalist withdrawal: a groartige election for citizens, it is </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want Hackebeil, but rather a collective task, from full right, the early stages, and constantly a choice and democracy, on this occasion on the European level </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal as this only one crisis, and that the situation in Europe we know, moreover already not more, where too put an end of the list </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is quite that Europe, which prevents the diktats of the markets and the Ratingagenturen, which is suffering under his impotence and his Solidaritätsmangel.. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is quite of Europe, which is humiliated on international level.. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> There is concern on Souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - here it is the whole of Europe, one which is beginning to lose its sovereignty, and thus any of it are often nations. and it is </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgent need is that the sovereignty of the leadership of the European project to give the hand. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it wants on the whole, whether the Europeans would reduce the burden of their debts, the markets are free to make and a future by investment. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from crisis has the decisions at the European level to a condition, which is taken without total democratic Rechtmäigkeit, without as to lead us quite certainly into destruction - </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Once this proposal has combated of Jacques Delors and the socialists time on long, short today of any European governance to do to it; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Agreed </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Present however without any political integration and a greater democracy, it would be a new folly and a further stalemate How they see the public </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We have to take a new stage for European integration on us. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> So creating of the Republic France, it has taken the fact to create republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of interests alone could not afford here enough; </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This instruction remains still valid </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We have to form a Europe better integrated on an economic level. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> That achieved only, by a political point of democratic Europe, creating a genuine European popular sovereignty; </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why will the unemployment of disabled or subordinate workers so high level? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of the disabled people are on search for a work, as well </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today begins die15, a week of the work for disabled people. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite an activist Öffentlichkeitspolitik, who was introduced in 2005, is the unemployment of highly always twice so when disabled people as the average average: 19% contrary, 9% Arbeitlosigkeit to the total population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Be discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> No, stresses Éric Blanchet, director-General of the Association Adapt, the week of the work in hand for people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> The progress that has been achieved within fifteen years, are considerable: </seg>
<seg id="2941"> Then, the unemployment was not twice, but a triple such great: </seg>
<seg id="2942"> Nevertheless remains enormous much to be done. </seg>
<seg id="2943"> We say, however, that disabled unemployed still many obstacles to stay, before they are getting a work.. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> More, it is the older people: 37% older than for 50, are of transport by the year. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They are on a low level of qualification: 80% they have no baccalaureate and it are only 10, 000 people under the 2.3 millions of students with higher qualifications. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, it is also the long-term unemployment to be very widespread: 53%, the people with disabilities with 38% in Gesamtschnitt. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, there are so many criteria, which make a new Arbeitseinstieg, and which are the very essence of the problem, as Christian Grapin, the director-General of Tremplin, of a 1992 should be formed of reunification, the business in help is disabled of working people using. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So to the factual brakes; </seg>

<seg id="2952"> This latter, the figures, which dates from the year in 2008 to point out on a Quotienten of 2.6%; </seg>
<seg id="2953"> We are now in the 3% reported Pierre Blanc, Director of Agefiph, the organisation who is instructed, of recovering contributions of companies, this law. </seg>

<seg id="2955"> Of the 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure to the companies, said Pierre Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> However, these improvement also brings a real recognition in particular proposals for the groen Firmengruppen on a resolution; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the ministry for work, only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 employees disabled employed people, dealing with 100 to 199 people against 82% </seg>
