<seg id="1"> The parliament did not support an amendment to liberate Tymoshenko </seg>
<seg id="2"> Ukraine&apos;s parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code condemning the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The amendment would open the door to the release of the expression minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The ruling is not yet firm, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West have raised doubts about the impartiality of the court. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The history of the Libyan release, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar el-Qaddafi was buried in a secret location in the desert and without it there is no longer any war. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves were cut off the hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women can already be forgetting to emancipate and apostates awaiting execution and so forth. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warlike tribes, will join in the Koran. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Libya will be established in an order that we cannot even imagine and that certainly cannot. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, our way of life is not the only or objectively the best and probably did not suit them, instead, Libyans already mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is true that leaves no surprise that the Islamic fighters accept grateful for the help of dogs infidels. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks not ran an American general, but Allah is great, whose greatness held after each of successful interventions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> When they seek winners in Libya, the West is not among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We are trapped in a shooting that serve the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not deal with Libya militarily. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this case, the local is a problem not expel the &quot;crusaders&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> But, without occupation is oil companies will be done with the Libyan black gold only with good words? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is quite possible that no, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights. </seg>

<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged between 9 and 13 years have problems of overweight, where the overweight affects the 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Obese children are mostly from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Becomes to show what the importance of the environment where it grows to a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference. </seg>
<seg id="81"> In the table, obsessive children are, for example, of sausages at least twice as frequently as the children of families with normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had cenado chips on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme &quot;The obesity is not a coincidence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="83"> In the families of overweight children there is no tradition of sports, which applies to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once per week, found time to exercise. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second edition of the programme of &quot;The obesity is not a coincidence,&quot; which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Until now, have participated in the project more than 12,000 children from the fourth to the eighth grade. </seg>
<seg id="88"> A proper diet and exercise in family are determining factors, which are significantly reduce the number of overweight children and even obesity. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the children polled have responded with five meals a day, according to the regime: Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,&quot; says one of the results of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Without breakfast for dinner but with sausage </seg>
<seg id="91"> Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, are important, moreover, the details, which also include, for example, have a fixed time for breakfast in the family. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of families of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In the majority of families, each desayuna alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> But the worst was to discover that in 10% of households are not desayuna nothing. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast, however, is the basis of a daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The study shows that in the families of obese children consumed much more often unhealthy the chips. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet drinks (70%). </seg>
<seg id="98"> As a general rule make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Diet Fabrícate your </seg>
<seg id="100"> The next phase of the study made it possible for kids elected (204 boys and girls of 13 schools) creates its own expenses from all the offers possible according to their tastes and opinions. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;Food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, they are far from the ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among his favourite foods are pasta, meat and sweets </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;It is especially alarming the popularity of the drinks sweet,&quot; is in the final report of the study. </seg>
<seg id="104"> As the main meal takes the biscuit pasta and closely follows the poultry meat. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Practically, children are always the pulse) and a taste for the fish and vegetables is very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Healthy habits change </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the study shows that children are ready to change their eating habits if they receive fair information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &quot;In the control group of participants in the study who completed the questionnaire after ending the prevention program&quot; The obesity is not a coincidence, &quot;was in many cases a major change in favour of the principles of healthy eating,&quot; noted in the results of the study. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Draws attention, for example, the sweet lemonade, where many children would start to prefer the ordinary water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for food and would restrict the consumption of fresh food and derivatives of flour. </seg>
<seg id="111"> The stylist must also be a good psychologist, argue professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article, how they learn the stylists, because I complained a little of that initial lessons were already pretty loaded. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I had no idea how things would go. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Conferences of three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer are the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us </seg>
<seg id="117"> And although the course is conducted every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Once we have studied with the director, NAFTA, (in no man) on how to dress for the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And so is the vast majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without adequate curves and someone is overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The hairdressers know optically soften a broad shoulders, extending a neck or recreate the necessary curves </seg>
<seg id="122"> They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the kind of Jennifer Lopez, breasts and hips huge but narrow waist and at the same time not customary in a way too challenging </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that skirts or trousers are not tailored, it is worth asking sewing at least an extra piece of cloth to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly not regret it, because the clothes that feels perfectly is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> With a tailored skirt will feel much better than with a not to move, get up, dance around the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Stylised body can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapeados. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am pleased that I have all week to bring order in my head all this information. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And even then, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each participant in the course assigned two famous, who must devise two rooms: One for the day and another for the night. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that is appropriate to the person in question. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I was touched &quot;dress&quot; to Miranda Kerr, perhaps speak of the campaign of Victoria&apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Cry inside, for me, is much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who recently gained weight will be around 100 kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Dresses have to cut from magazines or on the Internet search and printing, and then develop it graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The moodboard, which is called the outcome is as complete, further expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is also important to think about the graphic of the styling. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The hairdressers, therefore, is not only physically, but also deals with, for example, in the pages of products in magazines (of specific issues, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> All this we spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But all this is already on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The stylist has to have a global vision. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer and Jakub Polanka fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and stylist saberle should take advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a good stylist known to work with the same item of clothing in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is, in this case,. </seg>
<seg id="145"> As well, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) you can wear it with jeans and T-shirt classic, but also serves to wear the naked body with tacón shoes and photographing him as if it were in fact a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just arremangarla and raise the neck to obtain a totally different picture. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;Jugad with this,&quot; he insisted. </seg>
<seg id="148"> What I appreciate is the following advice: &quot;To start work, we need to first may know all the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then you can break them,&quot; said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally it is clear why memorizamos all these formulas, which combines with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines are different results. </seg>
<seg id="151"> This is without mentioning the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist must have more types of clothes in the reserve of which aims to photograph. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So, for a history of fashion that takes 10 pages (hence, ten outfits), we must be prepared, ready for use, at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And in addition to the photos clothes works in combination with other clothing, all of which are different from those that are used in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of success. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the márquetin have made her a global star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not even a clear trend to use the services of the stylists. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Until the famous people also are useless (I enough my skills, my physical appearance has no such importance). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And when someone asked our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a very different size to his right (lower). </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then there is only guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/lost, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the stylist is not enough focus on fashion, but has to understand outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> During his work, especially to communicate with people who dresses, so it is essential to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Knows assess people, there is no less, defends his views. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When a director is hired to beneficiaries.35 clasifiquéis clothing and completéis with fine clothes, you can&apos;t catch and throw everything they had and say, &apos;Oh la la what horror&quot;. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;Encontrad at least a couple of things that you consider and recommend to someone they can get,&quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also showed us that everything must be on the so-called &quot;placovka,&quot; that is, the stock market. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is set around the waist and there have all the necessary tools. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Are objects as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. There are also nylon thread (which he serves the stylist during the meeting of photos of products such as handbags or hats), special pliers clothing enganche ahead, whichever is greater (the pins and other attachments are not permitted, because it could damage the fabric), or a game of sewing. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Not to stay in the passive listening and put something in place, we have learned to take the often of shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even during the sessions of photos in the study, on a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And we did not do more to take and take. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We could not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to harm by accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So we had to be very skilful. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has given me a joy to commend my work without reservations. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The truth is that does not give me very well these skills. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small part of all those who have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I have already noticed that styling to devote myself to the professional level is not a path of pink, but it gives me exactly like what people say. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In need for speed: The Run it competes across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Overview </seg>
<seg id="181"> A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated because of a series of improper omissions of a routine trip during the morning. </seg>
<seg id="182"> To some extent they managed to meet expectations, but it is no use, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new delivery, which is added to the title The Run, awakened great expectations even before its premiere. </seg>
<seg id="184"> New promised to give up the old saga of careers need for speed and, as a result of the show, appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on his foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results will not vary much about what we had hoped. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are careers that can be taken by acceptable, but the total lost points because of failures absurd, which are already appearing in the series for years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> In reality cannot be or call mistakes, but it is more about the unwillingness of programmers incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Beneficiaries.35 is introduced in a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, he offers to participate in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Os sentáis at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is to offer something interesting. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into 10 stages and then, in more than 50 careers. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It follows that every race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> That way, one is not remotely the feeling that the game offers is always the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some are even pleasant environments in sight, although the technical level of the figure is equivalent to that of previous rendition of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Therefore, it is nothing of another world. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the walk in the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered in snow produced a very pleasant visual effect. </seg>
<seg id="199"> , is racing to diversify from time to time by an atypical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> So, for example, in the desert beneficiaries.35 encontráis a storm of sand that diminishes visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In contrast, in the mountains we must be careful not to beneficiaries.35 sepulte an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> According to this, each of the racing is very well developed. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There are only a couple of models, but this is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a time, intentáis advance to a number of rivals demanded (as normal in a classic race), after whom to gain time (classic duel timed) and then you expected a duel against a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In the midst of all this is sometimes the police, but that does not make things even more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Novelty are the landscape outside the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> When Jack interactive animations are, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, provided by clicking the button at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising, however, that there are fewer landscapes in the game of what might be expected (in particular, there are only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> But the end result is positive, because this element is not to be disturbed and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model is driving the fingerprints of the previous episodes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that today is no longer a big deal, but you cannot say that it is bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If buscáis a realistic simulation, because you can look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But in a race designed with enough action suits rather this style of driving, although we can find something better between games of competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So far, all in order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems arise after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the right models of driving, because this is not the case with collisions. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Games of this kind cannot expect recreated with deformities and collisions complicated, but in fact before a coup against any object, you cannot predict how they will react to your car, so that not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> It is typical that, to make a very tight overtaking or move the car with a normal traffic, has only slight friction, but in other situations almost identical, your car just doing gymnastics uncontrolled. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even just totally destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system of reseteo, no major problems arise, but may settle your differences now in a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The reseteos are scheduled in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or you salt of the runway, the game you rescue restores the last point on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="223"> However, in every race is available only five reseteos available. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If the consumís all, you have to restart the race from the outset. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So it is no more than a help in the event that something is not going well, but it is not very reliable. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only learned the aid of the stage in memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> In some curves, for example, is to enter a specific way; otherwise, are impossible to take. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Other times you encontráis somewhere vehicles &quot;civilian&quot; always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or lleguéis five minutes sooner or later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This makes rabiar especially in situations, when VEIS that two cars that are going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent is without problems, but when you, you must be either curb. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is like when lleguéis, because it is scheduled for the &quot;surprise&quot; always happen in front of your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents also have an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the game llegaréis to places where, without taking into account the time, you are always at the same opponent in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Furthermore this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Your opponent must come before you, whatever the cost. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it is in front of you, you makes the vision of cars that come from front, so that you can make porridge to start the car. </seg>
<seg id="237"> You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you immediately. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And it is a pity, because although the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action, so often it is not possible to continue to detail what happens or where. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And really gives equal, if the credit takes the idea with 50 clues exclusive or the classification in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else. </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is the change of cars during the careers. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You must be alert to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because then you must change their car, although in the vast majority of cases you what you will suffice. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for motorways and the exotic superdeportivos straight for a driving technique, for example, on mountain roads with curves. </seg>
<seg id="244"> In addition to main narrative thread is also a thread of challenges parallel, i.e., racing in specific locations that are known for the stories. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Conseguiréis here not only medals, but also points to experience for your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the tales. </seg>
<seg id="246"> To reach the highest level, the driver he opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds to the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> At the same time, there are connected a role Autolog online, which compares your results with those of other players and other Community disponibiliza functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the most difficult to understand is how it is made the last race in history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> With the car you until the subway tunnel (pass), where beneficiaries.35 ponéis to run in the dark on the tracks (go). </seg>
<seg id="250"> The os marks a speedometer between 150 and 200 km/h (go) and, suddenly, you get behind the convoy subway and goes ahead without further. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In the drafting may have a discussion about this for several days, whether during the programming of the game a little or none thought even if the authors we really taken by a bunch of stupid crooks. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects are in the majority of cases, pleasant, sometimes so impressive. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Because what a pity that, in the most tense moments it reduces the quality of image and, at times, in a serious way. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This particularly affects accidents where there are many players involved, when the quality of continuous image is no longer valid. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In order to make the most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each of his father and his mother,&quot; but you can assume that anyone would buy the game only for his music. </seg>
<seg id="257"> The final sense of need for speed: The Run is therefore quite confused. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game to avoid mistakes absolutely stupid, we would have problems in saying that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Gives the feeling that the game is not over. </seg>
<seg id="260"> The fun is insured, but preparaos because the mistakes will attack you in the eyes with the force of a spotlight on airport. </seg>

<seg id="276"> The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation for manifestly and Eurosceptics. </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&apos; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I had hoped that montase a merciless war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;Will last five, six years before the situation has stabilised somewhat, calming and the new players to become accustomed to their new roles,&quot; so he began with conviction its conference in the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How does not take seriously its motto &quot;clearly and openly about Europe,&quot; he said in the first part of the conference, when managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the Carolina Ulrich. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Vicenová also commended the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;The first arise criticism, that if it is bland, an official grey, capable of taking any role, but I have to say that left all confused, because it takes its role to perfection.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and that has a clear vision of where the EU should go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new post of representative of the Common Foreign and Security stems from the question: &quot;Who is this ΕU? What number can call it? &apos;Because it is an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union for states such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> Nobody wants to prevent us from the cheese Olomouc </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda was, is and will continue to the European Council in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs were emerging from the economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and held a summit for the Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representation in the EU has for the moment many commitments. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the ambassador: &quot;A good fuss,&quot; not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated. </seg>
<seg id="293"> On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> If the budget is more simple and effective, what will have priority sectors, which countries will receive more support and less? This is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador also recalled its main slogans, with those who came to Europe: &quot;About Europe with clarity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;The truth is that I do not like the abbreviations Ugly, the extranjerismos or the jargon that people do not understand.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="297"> &quot;How can a citizen to understand that in Brussels is not fabricate really cucumbers cucumbers or curved free round, plátanos of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban the Olomouc cheese?&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It also aims to get more of the atmosphere of the EU and bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> We expect Europe of the speeds </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people perceived rather negative aspects that the positive. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Also regretted the low turnout of the Czechs in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support for the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, underscored the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me when I go to a Polish and Hungarian and I was on a Slovak, a Frenchman in my hand, I said:&quot; What, you have already left, those of the Visegrad Group?, &quot;and you see that there is no laughing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="305"> In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, faces new regulations harsh budgetary policy for the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It is perceived as something very real the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new &quot;European Federation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We need countries in the eurozone and countries outside the euro zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;Said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those who do not, to be left out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;These procedures will be increasingly and strengthen the two-speed Europe&quot;, is expected Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this sense, also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the entirety of the EU should be discussed between the member states, not just between the members of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If you seek a term defined with great precision the strategy of IBM, the clearest would be &quot;long term.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, have already passed 100 years since its founding. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this character largoplacista the became the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Because he coined the slogan that many of the world&apos;s problems can be solved if people are willing to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its slogan &quot;Think!&quot; Became his trademark, around which will build the life of the future (giant was also the title of a magazine that IBM internal began publishing in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered over 100 years for that reason, because remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear the changes around. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This has enabled us during our first century, transforming technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Hope prosper even more in our second century, &quot;said during its anniversary, the current director of the company, Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> A sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, as in the 1930s, took care of their employees as the employer of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American who enjoyed operators paid vacation, sure, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewards the best inventors and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The same sophistication in the long term keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Right from the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (to be one of the first global companies ending any kind of discrimination, could choose without problems). </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which Palmisano to replace him next year a woman: Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She has been working 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies. </seg>
<seg id="330"> During the past few years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, of which there are countless future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is no surprise that allowed ideas, because in the signature work almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;From the beginning, IBM held a concept of institution rather than technology company,&quot; says the economist professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology,&quot; said George colony of the consultancy Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the &quot;Great Green&quot; - as it is affectionately known in the US because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both hardware and software, infrastructure and services accommodation website within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology). </seg>
<seg id="339"> Holds the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among their inventions are the cash dispenser, payment cards, the swaps, the bar codes and diskettes. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM billed this year 220 billion dollars. This year has become the second technology firm by market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when for the first time Microsoft in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The future looking </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the taste of customers and the time (IBM not opted for its own operating system, os/2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr). </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;If your business is based in advance, cannot emotionally anchored in the past,&quot; acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and equally, if they do not work, the leaves). </seg>
<seg id="346"> And this is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically is and always falls exclusively with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Of future technology </seg>
<seg id="348"> In terms of sales, IBM is devoted primarily to services, of which about one-fifth of programmes and one fifth of equipment. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the quota of suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="350"> From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology in the future. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Investments have followed since 2008, when for the first time was the modern global financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments. </seg>
<seg id="353"> It seems that until now the company IBM has managed to weather the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the shares of IBM since the start of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The currency of IBM is change everything, except its value. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant aguantará flexible. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: From the cutters of cheese until space flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, with its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> The name IBM already adopted in the year 1924 - originally was a brand used in branches of Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The basis that resulted in the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies that date back to 1880&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="361"> Possessed inventions such as the famous &quot;clock out,&quot; which allows us to control the entry and exit of employees. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Flint fichó at the head of a company in competition, Thomas J. Watson, to assist with the management of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas remain the firm basis on which underpin the corporate culture and identity). </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the company until the year 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, from cutting meat and cheese until tills. </seg>
<seg id="367"> During the first four years that Watson ran the company, billing doubled in 9 million dollars and began the vast expansion of the company by the continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so crucial to the company, almost 40 years after taking the chair of the leader, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his direction, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s, the staff and the computers of IBM helped NASA to guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the moon). </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The classics &quot;pecés&quot;, which established the standard of computers at the time, came to the market with the IBM 5150 in 1981. </seg>
<seg id="373"> 20 years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, became part of the consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and high value-added services. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that has paid IBM these last three years is the concept Smarter Planet, i.e., &quot;a smarter planet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="375"> Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, but have not yet been planned or areas has been improved the circumstances, for example, in regard to transport and the administration of cities. </seg>
<seg id="376"> For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the platform &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; that allows retailers to manage the business cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a long history in this country. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Already in 1932 opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country that took in Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, IBM ČR operates along the strategic center of outsourcing in Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Here, too, there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Rychtářová about her husband infidel: </seg>
<seg id="382"> Iveta it, stay in that donkey, which I no longer want to! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtářová (53) said it ended! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef woke up from his dream pink and would return home. </seg>

<seg id="386"> &quot;Pepe can return home, but no longer as my partner,&quot; explained Rychtářová. </seg>
<seg id="387"> When Darina Rychtářová hosted during the summer to Bartošové at home, could not even imagine how would your marriage. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Despite the request, Iveta had not been moved 30 days after Říčany and Pepe left to the singer. </seg>
<seg id="389"> So publicly stated that he loved. </seg>
<seg id="390"> With time, Darina resigned itself, apparently accepted the relationship of her husband and even sacked him forever. </seg>
<seg id="391"> To Rychytář does not care who goes to bed with his wife. </seg>
<seg id="392"> If one day Rychtář broke with Bartošová, his wife did not expect at home with open arms. </seg>

<seg id="400"> &quot;Darina and I talk to normality, the only thing is that we do not share a bed, said Rychtář. </seg>
<seg id="401"> If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &quot;No you sleep together, and she does not interest me, or where it is going, or if you have a boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I know that it is my fault, I enamoré of Iveta and I take full responsibility, &quot;concludes Josef. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst vices of women: They relate to you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If pedís men who are able to cite a few vices typical of women, in general, each of them will appoint them without thinking. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dear women, do you recognize the following lines, citing certain vices female who manage to make the blood boil men? </seg>
<seg id="407"> To go shopping </seg>
<seg id="408"> Do you accuses his orange average of dependence on purchases? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Is that bought at least one trapito in week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Would you like to buy often in rebates? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then, in his case, it can say that shopping has become a vice. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women realize that should appease his passion for purchases, at least a little. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But to see what woman could resist the temptation to walk without further by the clothes shops, finding clothes well adjusted and probárselas after all in the tester (ideally in all different colours)? </seg>
<seg id="414"> But for most women go shopping as a pastime, for men can become virtually in hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Just remember how many times he has already said his best cohabitee waiting in front of the door. </seg>
<seg id="416"> The constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I am not too eye?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &quot;Would need to lose weight at least five kilos - should begin to exercise?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;You really happy?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Do you not ring these phrases? </seg>
<seg id="421"> That yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> It is one of those women obsessed by their. </seg>
<seg id="423"> It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to their partners complain all the time of their physical appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The strong sex also agrees that the more increases the frequency of complaints, more annoying are women. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and the first cleaning </seg>
<seg id="426"> Infinite is like a merry-go-round. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Cleaning the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, mopping the soil, dust, mopping the bath and all that at least twice a week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Do you blame your partner that he has set foot on the soil with a clean dirty feet, their children that have marred newly cleaned a toilet and a shelf with glass doors that both cost clean? </seg>
<seg id="429"> If you suffer this &quot;diversion,&quot; proves to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that the order and cleaning probably should not be be paramount in the family. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This desire harmless cleaning could threaten their relations and family welfare. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Make nasty comments </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;The underpants used are left with the dirty clothes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;You want to get those socks tomorrow also used&quot; </seg>
<seg id="434"> &quot;The damp rag not be left on the ground!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="435"> If these comments to a couple more times a day, knows that it will take it out of their boxes. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Of course, you do not want to say anything bad, only wants to ensure that everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="437"> Maybe, if they knew that men, women, for its part, would not make many comments. </seg>
<seg id="438"> And gossip slurs </seg>
<seg id="439"> Some women, they are also the smears, the gossip, but also the offenses and conspiracy against someone. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are concentrated in relations, so I like to talk together of things the type who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> To the best to each of us sometimes is aware of a small and harmless setup. </seg>
<seg id="442"> With hand on heart, that is home to almost all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> On the other hand, there are women chismosas of those that are not controlled, who love chismorrear and do so often, despise each and are dangerous for the surrounding them, especially in a female labour team. </seg>

<seg id="451"> &quot;Sometimes seem ambushes,&quot; explained Jágr, after his performance to give him a goal for Giroux, following the first trallazo the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A short time after the second intervention of the Czech team had a trail. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voráček seized disk behind the goal for the Hurricanes and moved between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who got goals. </seg>
<seg id="454"> A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was thrown out, but since the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> After working with Jágr got the third goal, after his shot was colase for the fourth of the goal of Wayne Simmonds. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love to play with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I am not saying that it is the best player on the field, but certainly is among the three best,&quot; weighed Jágr at its plant. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I never would have happened at the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman like him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;I am very happy about this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I want to play for him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> All these years in the NHL, my colleagues playing for me, and it now produces results, &quot;adds Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina even turned the match in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again Dwyer, penalty, to get a goal away. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read did not allow more complications, but ended outnumbered two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Pronger had a good performance in our field.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;Cleared the disk, I took speed and Read went to the most remote.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to atinarle the disk and I am happy because I managed,&quot; Voráček described the final goal of the game as he lived. </seg>
<seg id="468"> With his victory, Philadelphia has been head of the Eastern Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, not played until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second quarter withdrew with an injury in the upper part of the body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomáš Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shootings. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defences. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;This is bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We are the only party with a veteran player, the rest were inexperienced.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;In the end, but is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;Both rotate players turned against us, we were able to resist.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We had to further simplify the game, make the disk of our countryside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> &quot;And so we leave gaps,&quot; explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 interventions of Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay. </seg>
<seg id="480"> The goals of jets were marked by five players that put an end to a series of defeats that has already lasted five parties. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have evolved the prices of travel since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 in the then Czechoslovakia had only five state travel agencies authorized: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies of the time sold in most cases only travel to the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime tipped towards the west and travel to the Czech tourists were then fairly restricted. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Checoeslovacos) are not allowed to travel freely and individually or even by the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, Poland and the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agencies in those days will also travel to the West, but one was put in the queue with a sleeping bag and spend it all night, or have &quot;well known&quot; in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Still not everything was won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for travel to the West, is not attached to the &quot;people politically unreliable,&quot; that they could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain resources (the West) to travel to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so we had a large number of huts and houses of summer, that the Czechs grew. This habit still persists. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The way to travel from the Czechs has suffered since 1989 a real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989 for us was not going over the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs did 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Is nna great paradox, which today because we are not aware of the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> At the beginning of the 1990s was imposed the exemption of visas to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The checoeslovacos, for a long time, there were sick of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see at least for a time. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, slept in Paris groups of Czechs in parks in tents, because our income then we were not allowed to pay for a hotel or pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was carried with them (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech koruna, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and with him also increased average wages, what about 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 onwards regularly, to prepare for journeys using the connections of charter flights, which was incredibly lower fares in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our trips. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting time in the history of tourism post-revolutionary happened back in 2000, when it was organised, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since that year, are all those years direct charter flights with Czech tourists was distant countries and warm. This winter is already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Exotic countries currently visiting the nearly 100 thousand Czechs per year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting time of this era, which symbolises our development post-revolutionary, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the US removed visas for Czech tourists, with what our country went to be among the world&apos;s most developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent on trips abroad more than 15 billion Koruny per head, including expenditure in the place of residence. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, which could end up again in deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="511"> For nearly five months without Czech football is chairman and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAČR), will not be known or after the convening of the next General Assembly meeting that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without them, will not even vote to choose between the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Stakeholders to chair the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned in June, but not before convening his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person who knew the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations of partnership unable to reach an agreement to choose a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was in evidence on 16 September when he had to be elected the new president. </seg>
<seg id="518"> General Assembly delegates gathered in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the district of Smíchov praguense, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice. </seg>
<seg id="519"> No consensus was reached or in terms of who in the General Assembly had a right to vote - only the legal representatives or delegates with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> From that moment, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, backed by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation for full powers is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> However, disputes over the electoral code remain open. </seg>
<seg id="522"> More light on the situation could not shed or the Executive Board, at its meetings, regular or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already, but the worst point remains the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model,&quot; says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which, from the direction of the association, which represents professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which will present his candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The Region of Moravia is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win the candidate with a higher percentage of total votes in both federations. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations percentage should have the majority of at least two-thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;It would, however, the connection to the two previous rounds and completely negate the concept of a bicameral system,&quot; as Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With this, surprisingly, agrees also Tomaš Paclík, even if it means that the electoral rules laid down by the Statute of all candidates should be more Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I would like to be voted the most in accordance with the statutes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;Not to invent any nonsense about representatives at the last General Assembly,&quot; says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and that his comments directed mainly against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passions are apaciguarán with the party today of our national team at the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football will be a major player, and cooperate more at ease,&quot; says the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in management of football, both professional and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is the more reticent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope that an agreement is reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not about the conflict between Bohemian and Moravian, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;Anyway, I hope that common sense will prevail,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Because there is not much time for all parties to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations had to be made in Montenegro, but who can know until we start the party if the football team will be complete? </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not emerged this morning by technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport to the executive committee will take place at the place where the party of classification. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, it could be that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to be held this Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties divided the country&apos;s most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation of sport (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of Sazka lotteries. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík will strive to reach the presidency, because there is a more suitable candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a suitable candidate that would satisfy all his ideas on the new chairman of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or run as a candidate for a seat as relevant. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there is a right person, I would be fighting for it and not me as a candidate in the elections.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But until now it has not been able to find such a person,&quot; said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK) </seg>
<seg id="552"> What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the presumed winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAČR). </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that, in case defeat, would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when reached the turn of ordinary general assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In that role he would like to see an expert and a good manager who is not too connected with the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;I have already spoken to some people who could take into account.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment not even want to identify with the Czech football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;I would like to change that vision,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What supposedly more upsets Paclík at this moment is Pelta&apos;s relationship with the president of the Football Association of Regional Plzeňský Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the little world as a powerful lobista with ability to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the chair. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If it wins, it would maintain the current status in football and nothing will change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;With the support of Berbra, a businessman ambitious, football will draw even less advantage,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta went unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what football prestige could bring the victory of Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And with what eyes we will look UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, which also takes some caution with his earlier statement that &quot;it would sell the club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík cooperation with Pelta could arise in the future. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Of same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to be followed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;It is very capable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But not as manager of a partnership.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I am not the nose where I am not capable,&quot; added Paclík, which attracted a lot of attention in September to support the suspension of the referees committee chaired by Ludek Marcel, replaced by Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík admits that dare to manage the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Uses its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer, is also the Director of Pilsen, with its support held in May the triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their practice safe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without burying its antipathies toward the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> One of the priorities also would be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which exerts pressure on political leaders to spend more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;It is one of the key problems that should be devoted to the new president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If you raise taxes on gambling, as it announced the political parties, would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where it ends up all this money,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Moreover, Paclík now does not take into account even its association with the of Club Pilsner, although he says that the President of the FAČR must be &quot;non-partisan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But I see no sense to give hypocritically my actions of the Club of Pilsen to another person and then to return there after a year and a half,&quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> FAČR Pelta promised the new statutes that would end up with the deadlock of the elections. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR had a new statutes that definitely serve to solve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral rules. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Even before the elections not made in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and raise funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months I could go either to defend and present, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;The people of all levels of football is a long time ago and hopes to know this Thursday, the new President.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the partnership,&quot; thinks the man who is associated mainly with the Club of Jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and in the executive committee of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="590"> For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as we thought.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we need a president since September,&quot; Pelta warned. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Exactly the readjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as decoys to win the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;If I am elected president, I take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in the event that it fails.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist,&quot; says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Moreover, in theory, is trying not to mess with their opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Already in the past had warned that it was working with Henry Rajchl, respect for their training in law, be aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president. </seg>
<seg id="599"> It was a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;Takes more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;Their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;So many of them have doubts about its true nature,&quot; he said to his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions until the superior. </seg>
<seg id="604"> The latter should be a showcase of promotion of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Immediately after I would involve in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football,&quot; he said two months ago to ÈTK the candidate of 46 years. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then also promised that his appointment as president of football will not lead to any change staff of the workforce. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;Should know first tasks of each employee,&quot; he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of lawlessness, there is an understandable anxiety. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicting that before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk this Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, certainly we shall overcome. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;Football needs credibility, which will recover only if finally takes a leader,&quot; still two days before the day more decisive in his career of representative, Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start to work with renewed vigour. </seg>
<seg id="613"> If, in the fourth General Assembly elected the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as the new chairman of the Football Association, many people would probably be resentful. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promised that, if elected, he would work hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It wants to implement a systematic change and make that members of the executive committee are responsible for each area of football individually. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue with the work begun by the former president Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As president, I would like to devote myself full football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA until the selection, via professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;This is not to say that it would do everything alone,&quot; he said in an interview for Rajchl ÈTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And asignaré difficult tasks for that football can, in each of those segments, go ahead with a lot of momentum.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;To many people that probably would not be happy, because it will begin to work very hard and not just to criticise the work of others,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, said that he had considered the possibility of not stand again as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;You know, that work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know that this makes sense and that there will be people behind me and I will stop at every turn,&quot; explained the reasons for his indecision. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;A lot of people told me that I must not give up, because then they would give up others.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;It is to have faith in order not to leave as well, without more,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> They say, also motivates him to continue the work already started with Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;During those two years, it ended a large part of the work that I do not want now be lost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;There are processes that had begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and I would not like to see someone the stop,&quot; announced worried by the fact that, if you choose to another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could return to be as it was before the era of Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in order, and that is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain. </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Behind him is especially all those people who would take care of football to be just a privilege for a select few.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;Attempt to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I would like to make a football for all, because only then will be well all and not just those elected,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Also rejects the idea that only serious bohemio the president. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Although some people are trying to pretend otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost to Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to think about the fact the split second division in a Czech side and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Does not give the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for the Moravians young players,&quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Although the battle of the presidential elections joined Tomaš Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I still have a strong support from the Czech Federation, which I chose as his vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me,&quot; said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kroner disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on the law of the lottery. </seg>

<seg id="650"> Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous restrooms in Budapest: Who visit Europe can live their wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their weary legs in bathrooms bubbly. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where is the best welfare in the water. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder conducted a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be lacking in their luggage, a swimsuits shown. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Backs lying down on the water, looked the artistic leadership at the top, swam towards the angelotes of marble, that the expected on the edge of the pool and pool deck asombraba before the modernist meticulously restored. </seg>
<seg id="654"> I liked the bathroom, noted in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and the history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented in his recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: Swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of bathing in the Black Forest, &quot;concrete buildings&quot; in Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Made his &quot;journey by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe&quot; by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> This German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Wants nothing to do with the sport, said Meder, only water is different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Only bothers him that fans will have to settle for bath blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans can breathe fascinating to run the smell of forests of fir trees or listen to the cheerful trinos of birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;One day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so ugly,&quot; says the head of Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;I began collecting fine swimming pools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> The surface of the water double the architecture. </seg>
<seg id="663"> The chapoteo in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of welfare in the swimming pools is so great because it addresses all the senses, according to Meder. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builder strives, covered swimming pools can be a real gift to view: &quot;Instead of soil, in the bathrooms are covers an area of water.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> All bends optically: High vaults, the tiles of colours, the launch pads. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The book with photographs in small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historic oasis of welfare, but, one might be tempted to jump to the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Meder, the collector of swimming pools discovers the copies in its investigations in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths as the Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique kárstica cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a spa, whose swimming pools are alkaline water and are in a building with a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular view: While the entire city puts the eyes in the swimming pool of Zurich overhead, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outside of a swimming pool in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath is a window from which you can see the practice in the ski runs. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The design, perhaps, more extraordinary expected to customers in Längenfeld: The cathedral of water Ötztal seems a ovni just land in the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Steam rises from three sources open in winter, while in the mountains of Ötztal standing up in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> At Meder, the collector of swimming pools, it was invading the smell of chlorine in all the swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the bathrooms of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague on diesel is so strong that people think we have reached a health bathing. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose loam sticks to the skin to enter into the swimming pool, a Enjoyment welfare in a special way. </seg>
<seg id="677"> Iris Meder is also disappointed in a place in their quest for beautiful places for bathing, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and baths sun bathing in the Czech Luhatschowitz, found itself with a blocked field. </seg>

<seg id="680"> Counters the decline in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The Palace spa in Bad Wildbald. </seg>
<seg id="681"> These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind; not only can discover neorománicos elements in times of its construction in 1844, if not an Arab hall style Alhambra, added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since his diligent modernization in 1995, the Palace spa bath is the favorite of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural for the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;Has a lot of merit merge different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic,&quot; says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> In a palace immersion in the swimming pool and spa apparently has no great importance. </seg>

<seg id="693"> Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions will be withdrawn from this business because intensifies the problems of the world&apos;s poorest. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> The author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity exchanges are up prices, and banks are burdened with the responsibility of the global problem of hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of the ombudsman is aimed in particular to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar fashion. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally, betting on raw materials are thought to protect traders of swings in prices. </seg>
<seg id="699"> The main experts agree that the players have been decoupled from the offers and demands, and reap profits of the costs of the poorest. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than the American competitors: Promised to review the claims and said that no business &quot;deserves to compromise the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to Spiegel online, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the report of Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the directive of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter. </seg>
<seg id="703"> At the end of January, the management of the bank will report of the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="704"> The end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even its total abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann is trying to fix its image. </seg>
<seg id="706"> Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed their criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Betting on rising food prices are particularly dramatic how ruthless the banks are currently the public welfare.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann stands as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in his portfolio in the game to put in the money for stakes of food prices,&quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;It does not matter if Ackermann is the subject of people suffering from hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post. </seg>
<seg id="711"> Monday, Deutsche Bank wrote that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different to what had not planned on the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And needs that barely interested potential losses, this will be his successor. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Two-thirds would rescind the investment in raw materials </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch struggles to keep the pressure on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the campaign of the organisation. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday, Bode published the survey by the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Barely 10 per cent considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments in the bet that food prices. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such business: According to the survey, two-thirds would rescind all investments of the money that comes from land speculation. </seg>

<seg id="722"> Moved the flag </seg>
<seg id="723"> Ingeborg Wiensowski on </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now it reopens as home of exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The architecture of modern postgerra passionate about, forms clear, the halls of glass, the bold curves and new construction materials, typical of thought on the technical progress, for which the Austrian flag of architect Karl Schwanzer for the exhibition of 1958 Brussels is a good example and known. </seg>
<seg id="727"> The Pabellón of Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture for his slight and floating construction of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The building is considered to present a milestone of the contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> To the well-known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary tower for four cylinders MBW more the adjacent building bulldozed in Munich, became internationally known. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Its flag, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions was lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century, was called the &quot;house 20.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building was appropriate but lacked the appropriate technology and space for a museum; no wall to hang art, or a good atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Despite this was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The building is empty since 2001 and increasingly lapses. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the flag, now calls it &quot;home 21&quot; and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday afternoon opened the Belvedere museum, which owns the house, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Agnes Husslein-Arch, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arch, doctorate in art history with a remarkable career, among other things, artistic patinadora on ice in his youth, later in &apos;, the Guggenheim museum director and founder of the modern art museum of Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> With the exception of contemporary art, are the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation document -, there should be a bar and a bookshop and also built an office building. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict control, low budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was the best choice to do so. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because reformed so sensitive the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded and was awarded the contract, if not because studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a &quot;important place and immense,&quot; which was &quot;almost every weekend&quot; exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for use with generosity and easily. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was &quot;a devorador of energy,&quot; said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> It changed the profile of the windows on the facade of glass, was installed an insulating glass fibre reinforced glass and replaced the glass ceiling for a special safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or substituted and the ceilings of asbestos were rehabilitated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light declined between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the flag of Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> Remain the original external doors, the house is painted in shades old mahogany and protected against rust. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often had to find material that was good, cheap and also would like to the office of protection of monuments,&quot; says Krischanitz and warns of a harsh land in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Flag as &quot;that came from Brussels&quot; has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;casual appearance in the history of the city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> An architecture that is &quot;always in the wrong place,&quot; and that is why I wanted to &quot;raise awareness appropriate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has been planning a stroke of luck. The entirely new and planned &quot;district of the central police station,&quot; with houses and offices, sits alongside the Schweizer Garten. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And perhaps happen another stroke of luck: The house 21 could receive a strengthening of other construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary art and Berlin, as you hear, negotiated with the city on a neighbour in the Schweizer Garten. </seg>

<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,&quot; said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA, held the deference of both financial institutions. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for credit unions in the US and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect investments of customers. </seg>

<seg id="854"> In addition to the effort of a comprehensive explanation and a reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank of Lake Zurich scandal </seg>
<seg id="856"> The bank more risky in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slid from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now directs a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> Not sure that Axel Weber had thought. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the summit of the federal bench in July was known in 2013 would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber is happy publicly praised for its beauty and Switzerland&apos;s UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves fall kind remarks about their future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The USB has achieved a revitalization.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> In September, it became clear that everything would be entirely different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank&apos;s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Oswald Grübel, director-general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The chairman of the administrative council of USB was seen since then also touched on, and all asked: When is Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Weber was known to advise the bank since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And will take over the chairmanship of the administrative council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> This is hard to Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, rather, economics professor and adviser and has had a period of adjustment is probably necessary. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Coup is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just returned to prove that deserves the title &quot;the biggest bank of the scandal of Europe&quot; for some time. </seg>
<seg id="873"> On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently, was the world&apos;s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, is mired in a scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, he saves at once so proud Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> Began the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the Swiss property manager discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in the investment banks. </seg>
<seg id="878"> On the one hand, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand, advanced as investment bank in the league of big banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This impressive. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: &quot;To my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From today&apos;s point of view, one wonders: How could be wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> Was in a big mistake. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the sticks. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, which until then was regarded as a brilliant banker and very intelligent, surprisingly resigned. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, suspected the reason. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The fund&apos;s investment bank embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To shoulder this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For this found investors, of course that some look with contempt until shortly before: A state fund Asian and opaque of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, which had never been heard his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second-best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, continued the disaster, in view of its misguided investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought distressed securities to the UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which became co-bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> All Switzerland was affected, it said the dramatic that was this for a small country, if all such large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;We cannot go back to rescue the UBS,&quot; said Geiger, an expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first disaster joined the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was ready to hand over details of wealthy clients, which may have disappointed taxes with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, adopted a figure of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted benefits of these business with compensation for payment. </seg>
<seg id="901"> With this, the UBS confessed more or less have helped in tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time lost something that had always been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: The glow of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board and the president of the administrative council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of funds of clients. </seg>
<seg id="906"> In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two key areas: In the investment banking through the erroneous speculation and in the administration of goods through aid for tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when he returned to be more calm, just when it was thought that the UBS returned to achieve this, it is this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realised that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it was unveiled, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the case Adoboli statesing that risk controls have changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: &quot;The problem of the UBS is not that dominates the risk controls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers were submitted for some time, be the guardians of the greatest assets of the world: No risk too big, on the other hand, the safety of the money it wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of the iron reliability, as Lindt chocolate Sprüngli and real. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The plant of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the strong Swiss private bank, is only a little higher. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its headquarters in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to the lake in Zurich, surrounded by snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here the buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Here are smash as Tiffany&apos;s between traditional business as the Swiss confectionery Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Living here for years the Swiss banks: From the national bank, through the palace of Credit nothing, until the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> It comes into the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are lined with marble, before they are large leather chairs, along with the bank&apos;s logo is a great sign to indicate the &quot;security&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS knows what the customer wants here: Security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit nothing, at some point have shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as does the president of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Prefers not to read her name in the newspaper, after all, as all Swiss bankers, also with the business of the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has become too big, believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss had nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And have been used for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, gave his first major gain and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;This Wednesday, the coalition government of the tiny country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish). </seg>
<seg id="930"> Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billions of euros to save the big bank of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How it happens? </seg>
<seg id="932"> Talks with Swiss bankers, see the problem in the dimension of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge into a powerful consortium. </seg>
<seg id="934"> There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> So that served for the two different banks precursors of the UBS complement: A bank rich but slept with the heart of the administration of goods in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a great financial bike. </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are two names associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Association of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought that Wuffli Ospel and were a perfect team,&quot; says the expert on banking Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive that managed to make headway since learning in the bank until the summit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: &quot;Thought that their models were a reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;It is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: The Nonsense came before the event. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of the UBS clearly remember meetings of managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Lowering the throne to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Topped the &quot;League tables,&quot; classifications that then documented the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> The UBS wanted to be at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps he went well. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the operations of foreign currency and in the negotiation of actions was higher. </seg>
<seg id="951"> However, the business advisers charged showed a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of banking &quot;fixed income,&quot; there is a huge compensation for the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that nearly cost him his life. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Eager for growth, invested so much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created American investments in high-risk. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Transformed itself into a powerful machine to securitise mortgages American and then sell them, maintaining certain risks to their own account. </seg>
<seg id="956"> And also, as other banks sought the fall for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, an expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So great euphoria, so deep the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager had to leave, because the attempt to organise turned out to be more complicated than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Posts in the UBS became proyectables seats and are unsafe until today. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Currently, who heads a large bank, has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Must find a strategy for a bank, to which all the logical business models are lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, concentrate on property management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The bank does not want to go so far (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking should reduce much, it is clear today. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> In reality, it was only in the Italian-Swiss 51 years as a transitional solution, because the bank the bank is surprisingly Grübel separated from his predecessor. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime, he imposed: Should conduct permanently business of UBS, told the bank in Zurich on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Deletes 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But this is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What he wants to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that are sure Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="976"> So far only said that first seek a house with his wife in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> The next year. </seg>

<seg id="1014"> About love, others want to get rid of them very quickly, for years the grajos belong to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate complaints from neighbors in the dirt and noise of animals. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story of the First World War, &quot;begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one falls the soul to their feet. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Here are some tips for action: Start mildly this page and make it a their brand pages. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> It will be very familiar with these people in the narrative novelística of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae will work as their GPS, a beacon for those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Mr Englund is a historian and journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> What he has written here is an unusual book, which describes, rightly, as &quot;a work of anti-story.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Contains some notable names, treated important or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is not so much a book about what happened, explains, &quot;a book about how it happened.&quot; Is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; combines the experiences in times of war of more or less ordinary men and women 20, on both sides of the war, from schoolchildren and Gardens to escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some become prisoners of war, or lose its members, will become crazy or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Their lives parpadean here as votivas candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix, while others turn off lights. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book by Mr Englund is a departure from the standard history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War, was the only fatal trench warfare on the western front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; moves of expertly through other theatres of war: The Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, eastern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> Soldiers in this book I fall over the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies fly-fly are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is a book moving, almost from the start. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordita. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you&apos;re a woman who is at home with your children, are there or huyes? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Anyway, who comes? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Almost nobody understands what is happening, or even why it has to fight this war. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Lack of facts,&quot; observes Mr Englund, &quot;has been filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;The beauty and the pain of the battle&quot; continues to individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the fleet of the high seas. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories have been mostly of memoirs, letters and other material already published earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr Englund. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of these are about deprivation and make do with what we have. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> About tell the story of a German schoolgirl says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes for all parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Ersatz coffee, aluminium false, imitation rubber, paper masks, wooden buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Still talking about the food substitute in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Describes &quot;meat made from rice cooked and rolling carnero fat (and topped off with a bone false made of wood); tobacco fact roots and peladuras of potatoes dry; shoes with soles of wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There is, observes, &quot;837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories are about the honor and courage. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the savagery and says about the war: &quot;Sientes that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that the veneer of civilisation and means that there is a barbaric behind this pechera almidonada and tachonada.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Instead a British soldier realises that probably will die, and that no one will notice or care. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;Once you are resigned to the thought of sacrificed, you would think that could happen in front of the public,&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead, it is horribly similar &quot;to a convicted being strangled in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,&quot; writes Mr Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> It reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiario of the young century: The mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with good clothes of clothing that executes its carnage while is sitting behind a desk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who tried to actively take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading the service in the front. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The most grotesque expression of this can be seen trade gonocócico., soldiers and buy embadurnan with their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital,&quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those who are truly desperate looking it over their eyes, which often leads to a lifetime blindness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation of the Swede made by Peter Grave, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to the task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to &quot;exceptionally uncontrollable forces unleashed: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People start to ask why their leaders are doing to combat them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Without novelty in the face of Erich Maria highlight, rather than comprehensive stories. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon unconventional. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book is one of the most devastating end that I can remember in a work of non-fiction. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Not will reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if it had come from his book, torn between your fingers of this page dramatis personae, and had burned with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After a false step prior, a planned assault at the minute </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> They chose the night from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept secret, except for a few high-ranking officers, saying initially to others who were joining a year. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The detective Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, their presence underlined how the operation was had infested of challenges for the police department. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> They could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the espray of pepper spray on the protesters, in breach of the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the &quot;okupas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And why the police operation to clear the protesters from Zuccotti park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Agents had been prepared seeing as they had developed occupations in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A bigger disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking to Zuccotti. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Agents increased unrest - known as the training of counter-terrorism measures that involved mobilizing quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was on the evening of Monday, on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The orders to enter the park arrived at the last minute, &quot;said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as&quot; an exercise. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few polis I know that they were called for this, they said it was to enter Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke anonymously. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only people who knew that they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned for the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, some players wanted to clear the park, but declined when hundreds of protesters came ahead of time after having heard about the plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> The operation on Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces around the municipal district - dozens of mobile operators who regularly used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly said that many people, such as those who commute to work, had been bounced back and forth the park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to do so when he was the lowest number of people in the park,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with pockets and loudspeakers gathered at the junction of Pike buyers with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and the pre-recorded messages from the loudspeakers that retumbaban seemed to intimidate many demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> Community affairs officers were at the park with his clear blue windbreakers, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and they were. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> There was no shop until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time for the protesters to gather their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Journalists in the park were forced to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, the Police Department&apos;s chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists said they tried to avoid that saw the police go into action in the park, and had been treated rudely by agents. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that the mobile television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> As the police was moving towards the west through the dense thicket of personal effects of demonstrators, including luggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic clothes overcrowded, teams of the Department of Cleaning followed them, picking up what was left behind. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A core group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some did a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp was candaron between them for the arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people were chained to trees, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Emergency service officers were called to cut the locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> No arrests have been made in the park until more or less the 3:30 a.m., said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> Clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that a 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests were for &quot;disturbing public order and resistance to authority,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives of the department, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr Kelly, while he was here, &quot;was not conducting operations,&quot; said Mr Browne. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> A second group of players expected along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Rose up barricades in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and the Pine Street, a block south. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> From these positions, was to the police by extending the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At one point, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people to outside. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> There were some 28 people in the northern perimeter. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the most vocal of the night took place south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Around 5 a.m., south of the Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air of the wheels of a police van. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At any given moment, a piece of plywood went flying from the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The workers&apos; union will require support to the city by redundancies </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> Demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon available to the union, the municipal district 37, in their effort to repeal the redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred and seventy-two assistants from school, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the worst paid the city lost its work on 7 October, in a move that the union leaders have described as a political vendetta for his refusal to allow the spring, access on the part of the city to a health care fund in charge of working groups to close its budget gap. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Municipal authorities have strongly denied that accusation. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing in the city last month, the education adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the Council contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be made redundant. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The 37 municipal district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning to the Department of Education that would be sued and held a press conference Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Demand will include Mr Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers made redundant as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino, like most of the assistants who lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as it had been subsidized chronically underfunded. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> It Noted that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where the 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says, &quot;This is not a district of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The district&apos;s budget P.D. 36 fell 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city has changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrolment for poor in schools. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also states that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memorandum used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, despite the fact that &quot;surplus&quot; describes more often the act of moving to a master of the payroll of a school in a bag of work, whose salaries are paid by the central office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six coordinators of parents were made redundant,&quot; says the draft of the complaint, &quot;and not only in surplus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All that was needed was that the rebellion had success, that the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed and the participation of the United States came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by the chairman John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding Libyans for his successful rebellion and US troops for their &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may seem harmless, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy so far. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, lawmakers of both parties fought among themselves and with the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and never came to be voted on in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> That left the US mission in a kind of purgatory of legislation - with Congress sufficiently troublesome as to criticize the handling by Obama of the mission, but not so angry enough to actually mow the grass under his feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate could be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and remarkable resilience to free themselves&quot; and &quot;pays tribute to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Ganará does the new measure the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divided lawmakers as it did the bill June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The spokesman of Venue said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Congressional Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia (Republican), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that achieves a vote by the entire assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have not succeeded so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are duplicated - the same bill proposes in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget Amendment only in the House, and another handful that &quot;will control federal spending.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of these projects bills also are identical among themselves, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of such a measure. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote an amendment to the budget balance. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea that amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while the Democratic representative José E. Serrano (in New York), wants to take the two-term limit for presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Christian by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So enthusiasts who have been members to propose amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 changes, and 66 in the 110th. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace is unacceptable in comparison with that of the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But not had much more success then than they are now. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Battered but not defeated,&quot; Giffords said in his first interview since the shooting on TV </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman fired him at point-blank range in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona (Democrat) appeared on national television Monday night, sang with the melody of Broadway &quot;The sun will come out tomorrow,&quot; and said that he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In his appearance on ABC News &quot;20/20,&quot; with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed help to walk. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The programme documenting their difficult path back to the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and drilled the left side of his brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, returned by surprise to the House to cast their votes triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, Rio and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked how it feels, Giffords, 41 years, he replied: &quot;Quite well&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme of &quot;20/20&quot; a one-hour, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book, &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting of 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, sees in his hospital bed, with the head shave and a long scar across his face. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She can only have one or two fingers stand tall, while her husband the encouraged. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, sees Giffords seated in a wheelchair while therapists taught him how to make simple actions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A movement. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A fruncimiento the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, his first word: &quot;What&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - &quot;marmalade toast made,&quot; a request for a change in its breakfast menu. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: Sees the congressman therapists singing along with the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; of Cyndi Lauper and &quot;Free falling&quot; Tom Petty. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which makes two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> That her husband was leyéndole Giffords said in a newspaper article about the murder of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and is being forcibly medication while awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people died,&quot; he said Giffords to Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of recovery of his wife, she said: &quot;I have been defeated.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So, I said, &apos;Gabby, has not been defeated,&apos;&quot; said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> &quot;Only has been hit. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you are going to get out of this, and you go to recuperarte and you are going to come back stronger than ever. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops felt more pity that respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a display of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a Ballad about the impotence, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd of label got up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The men and women were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising of spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer in the display, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;The showed as a kind of orphaned children,&quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers had good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> That they had. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it was not respect, really. It was unfortunate. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The conflicting views starkly illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an American public often distant, sometimes adorador. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> Troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has a price, say members of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public increasingly acts as if he were death those in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon towards. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way that some show their support is set to us in the role of souls helpless.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also realize that anger faced by troops who returned in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result, the majority of the talks on the pity are carried out in silence and in private between war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons returned to combat with the Marine Corps, Colonel withdrawn Mark Cancian warned that people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would regard them with a sense of fear because it clashed with insurgents and travelled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others wonder whether there would be a &quot;veteran angry and violent beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During their search for employment, he said, felt that some interviewers subtly had asked whether it would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative impressions,&quot; recalled Cancian contándoselo to their children. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The military concern stems, in part, of the American indifference toward the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The achievements in the field of battle are rarely elected to the praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We, as a nation, we no longer military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War,&quot; said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The army faces growing pressure to end the violation </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women have a case against the army for its alleged failure to rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organised for the next. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> The soldier first Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy night in which she says she was raped by a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was October 2008, and was on his way back to his barracks at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who had a package of 12 cans of beer. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could join her in her room to take a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;Sounded an alarm signal,&quot; Lyman said. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> However, the Texas native left aside their concern. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought, no, has 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;Is of Texas,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I had listened to my instincts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, tirándola down and raping her, he argues. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel anxiously await a court decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand that have filed against the former of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go on trial. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the widespread violation between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., demand was initially to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them say they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke said that will by the top brass in the army, because the problem starts with them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is a structure from the top down,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present a number of cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy, in essence, that the military cannot be sued for current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> By a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;Damage alleged are part of the military service of the plaintiffs&apos;, say the documents. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear the front lines. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: Between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that the army was also modernize, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> She is not alone in their struggle, and three other demands are in place, in addition to the hook. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veteranos is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting an environment misogynistic. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a complaint against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; allocated to victims of rape in order to give them the high of service -- a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the Women&apos;s Action Network in Service, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans administration, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the way it handles complaints of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010 was 3,158 sexual assault reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault Response and the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon&apos;s own estimates, that figure in approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred this year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: In 2010, a 20 percent of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it happened. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, he says, he was asked to count the details of its violation 11 different times in a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker -- a court in its brazo was found in his bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about who had had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people testified as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when was read out the verdict,&quot; Lyman said. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought I was going to go to work, I found myself screaming from the room.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;I put in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I said to my commanding officer,&quot; That was not his trial. This was my opinion. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which did not fit for the service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 was excused from service under terms less-than-honorable, which prevents him from receiving any benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law George Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, says, &quot;In my opinion, should be able to move forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I have been a critic of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And he adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things only change when the good people is ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the audience is not on his way, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will put the queue to its other hundreds of applicants for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We are going to continue to fight against the army in this issue until the reform will take place,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> &quot;Or until we muramos, what happens first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: Researchers are studying how you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another kind that aireaba its anti-immigration views online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being only in cyberspace: Had spent most of the time that preceded his attack to her computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups in social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Only easy - you have to go into Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We realised that it was not so difficult to reach them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a recently published report on the European digital populism in the centre of British studies demos. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The cache of personal information on Facebook is so encyclopaedic says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the tool of advertising to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that sellers have been using for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Bartlett found half a million fan of right-wing groups across Europe and then I turned announcements, but instead of a new band vincularles or product of diet, advertisements invited users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;Is a completely new way of doing an investigation,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of the right-wing groups tend to be young men and angry about immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> However, in a kind of swing, &quot;those who combined his activism in line with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work of demos is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research centres, medical researchers and scientists politicians are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the &quot;likes,&quot; messages on the walls and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users by adding an average of three pieces of content per day, &quot;supernova of data&quot; of Facebook is creating a boom of research, boosting the number of scholarly papers with the name of the site in the title until almost 800% in the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to look at the people who you could not acercarte with a file on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;Before, when intentabas surveying people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You go through the party, and they never would allow you access,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the social-health problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues found that university students who spoke of their feats of binge on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drink that students who remained silent on the issue. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as residential advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who publish too many updates of state with its binge drinking. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can&apos;t deal with a problem if we can diagnose,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behavioural Child Development at Seattle Children&apos;s Research Institute, told the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook is also constantly &quot;nudging&quot; to his own people to obtain data. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The Team Supervisor of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine&apos;s Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make available to other large amount of data for research). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> However, Facebook users know that the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice on the power play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres away is to allow the site undermine your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what happens when users of Facebook become part of a survey that do not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect their data out of line, online is a free lunch for all. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a 2006 study conducted with the walls of public Facebook students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even outside line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research this being completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information in a user&apos;s profile and the messages of the wall are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; said Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a pen and a sujetapapeles remain the best research tools that anyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute for entry into the real world and talk to real people,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of social still happens out of line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of the &quot;resistance&quot; during his first public appearance in court in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights templarios of Norway,&quot; he said to a room full of 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I am opposed to the court, which received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the facts but I plead guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim aborted Breivik during that monologue, because &quot;I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their points of view.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason refused to allow Breivik, which brought a speech writing in advance, go to the families of his victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, denied access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to keep a tight rein on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came with the hope of Breivik look in the eyes, others to confirm that is kept under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All were with the aim of moving towards the conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought that seemed cold and inhuman,&quot; said one survivor of Utoya ​ ​ the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked to journalists and the survivors in the eyes when it entered and left the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of &quot;resistance&quot; greater, the judge ruled that is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is possible that some are some comfort that the attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a radical group. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But that does not automatically relaxes the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would like to look like a monster, but not think so,&quot; said a family member of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be much easier if it seems.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 Lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, are in a theater this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Following the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of modern technology as the Great inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> But what the fan of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently discovered anew that has been dusted in advance of a series of special projections in the largest markets this week, is how much this meant creative minds about business processes and workflows of products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> It was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but it was also a meticulous and an organizer of the flow flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives were &quot;a disease that is to think that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the nerds (The Triumph of the nerds) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time had passed barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and has worked hard on his new computer company next, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of the interview was used in Cringely nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was only after the death of Jobs discovered a full copy VHS in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This archival material, slightly reprinted, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And very muses. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is clearly weighing their thoughts, seeking clarification. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when the perfectionism of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of Cringely, empujándole to go faster towards the issues and arguments of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic interview in The Lost, when Jobs assesses what sees that other companies are right and wrong, and offers its own vision of the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something crude oil and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the dreamer keen on the verge of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of as you can and must be things. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Not long after explain everything in detail here, and it did. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of seven major sequences of The Lost interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> About how he learned to carry a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;Over the years in the business, I always wondered:&quot; Why are you doing things? &quot;And the answers that you are invariably:&quot; Oh, this is just the way it is. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounts of Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Taken aback by the way they tracked the costs - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that was as a rule of thumb, and then followed with a &quot;variable&quot; - developed an automated factory that claimed that could determine the costs of trade in detail. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> On the joke Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs recounts the &quot;Blue Box&quot; which he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people hackear effectively the telephone company and to make free long-distance calls. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> It has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he and Wozniak proved the box through the use of a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from a network of AT &amp; T to another, while creating a loop with the largest number of satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and came back a minute later on the phone to the public next door,&quot; says Jobs with a risita. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Us two, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - was a lesson incredible, and I do not believe that Apple had never existed without it. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak nearly abandoned, knocking the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the very Pope was excited to go to answer the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Fall in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build a frequency meter, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and I made a call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That was a considerable influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they dealt with their employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> After Jobs became one of the employees of HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first table computer ever made.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen cathode tube, and I enamoré him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Get a trip to HP as a teenager and lose the time with this machine and would write programs for it. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Improvise on innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> At various points in the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the march. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, which was devoted to sell a handful of collectors, a customer asked if I could put the whole team. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Working with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, while I was at Apple, recalls the battles that clashed in the development of a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember having dramatic arguments... I shouted that it would take five years to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> 90 days later, we had a mouse that we could build on 15 dollars and that was completely reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies losing strength: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before that lead the rebirth of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way in which many leaders of industry encountered in his vision, and would lose control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;I gave that you have worked at IBM or Xerox, for what you do best copiers and printers, and what?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company has no more success. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing departments are increasing success, so are the kind of people who end up running companies and individuals responsible for the products are driven out of the forum for decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position it rots because of people who do not have the notion of good vs. bad products products - the knowledge of the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what happened in Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have hijacked the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Could have been 10 times its size, it could have been the Microsoft in the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Took the defeat of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as artistic expression: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it develops the big idea, changing and growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Learn a lot about the subtleties of the same. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that you can&apos;t do that make electrons, glass makes them, the robots, factories make them. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> 5,000 you have to keep things in your brain - these concepts - align them all at the same time... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> In the end it all comes down to taste - exponerte rebate to try to better than a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things that you are doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that the good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have never had shame about stealing big ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> What did in large part to the Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it were not for the technology, could be doing wonderful things in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas cenan with rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue politically controversial whether they would accept the challenge to the healthcare law President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the signing of lawyers who will set out the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered at a preliminary hearing to consider carefully the requests for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases in question was a complaint filed by 26 states defy the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to admit the demand and, in fact, is expected to be a historic plea for five and a half hours in March, and the result will probably will further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the court&apos;s decision is known. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law should be scrapped will probably be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The signing of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court&apos;s preliminary hearing on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical standards. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If it were, it could be said that fall under the Code of Canon 4c, which says: &quot;A judge can attend events to raise funds to organizations and other related to the law, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges that adheres to the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Common causes (cause). </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges were agasajados in a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> His appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that too easily mix the activity of the court with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife of Thomas, Ginni is a prominent conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan worked as solicitor general for the Obama administration when it introduced the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> His critics have pushed for Kagan refrain from watching the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has not given any indication that it will do. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing receives a record of 18 billion dollars </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The Emirates airline asks 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option to 20 more. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a transaction valued at more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it is a great transaction when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of 18 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, a gold mine in future growth in orders for aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will require 2,520 planes worth $450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced during the weekend its biggest-ever asked for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing twin-aisle 777 jets. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The successful asked wine of the Emirates airline in Dubái. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would bring the total sale price to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced in the Salon Dubái in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel savings and services for passengers spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;This is clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Dihora Neal. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of these customers in particular is very strong.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines in the Middle East are the property of their oil-producing nations. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but that an increase in fuel prices - generally bad for airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;Have a natural protection,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the market for wide-bodied aircraft and helps to keep at bay the attempt to its competitor Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with the A350 passenger jet. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&apos;s victory at the fair of the air comes four months after Airbus said that would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> Delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Boeing Co&apos;s shares rose 1.5 percent to 67.94 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the elections of violent state, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favour of one of his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state of Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> &quot;The involvement of organised crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday, is alarming, not only in Michoacán, but for the whole country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday&apos;s vote. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Threatened to our candidates, our electoral workers... It seized the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote&quot; in favor of the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI has the hope of winning the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo appears to have overtaken by little room to Calderón, who had led the polls before the election. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderón, a candidate of the conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the left divided and unfortunate before the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> It is the home state of President Calderón, Michoacán and he chose to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> The violence has persisted. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A mayor of the PAN was killed a week before the elections while was campaigning by Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the local candidates for fear. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Although the PRI, unpleasant as the elections of Michoacán, a victory will help boost the party. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in presidential elections, Henry&apos;s grandson, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: &quot;I believe that this victory should be very encouraging for the next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1726"> ADB urges Asia to help bail out the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, managing director of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two major world&apos;s fastest growing economies in the world had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to speed up the recovery of economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned against the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries who are watching the difficulties of Europe in a &quot;impartial&quot; and said that the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and European resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all in this together.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;So if China and India can help, by all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, Italy&apos;s borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for the major emerging economies to join to help the eurozone to find a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the EU&apos;s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, India&apos;s Minister of Commerce, said that &quot;India is going to do everything possible&quot; to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;Nobody wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> &quot;We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> &quot;It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility in helping the rich European when faced with their own and deep economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the $200 billion people in India, of which up to 800 million live with nearly $2 a day or less. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> &quot;At some point you realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not fall well,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of India should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public sector workers Greek, in jobs of companies badly managed, and loss-making as the railways. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to &quot;significant effects on chain&quot; across Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces the &quot;downside risks&quot; due to the threat of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows of their economies. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Pentagon serious warnings about the possible cuts in defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic cuts looming budget could undermine national security and trigger a chain reaction in financial from the corridors of the Pentagon, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, the assembly chains civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called &quot;kidnapping&quot;, would lead to a 23 per cent of global reductions and a high of many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;A cut so great, this applied indiscriminately, would make the most of our naval construction projects and could not be carried out - you cannot buy three-quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously harming other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;Also we would be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and due to the reduction would be so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and seriously would damage the readiness.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts in time would reach to the combat troops, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;While funding for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations are not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis,&quot; Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the main military power in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are firmly against such draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening, when published the letter to Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is not an outcome that can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> If the letter to Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget compromise or intensified calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the possible cuts, despite the fact that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that it faced difficult decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a brigade without bullets.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is an air wing without sufficient trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force that is suffering from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up to date with the potential adversaries.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;In fact, invites aggression...&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provides new details of how the cuts &quot;generate significant operational risks: Delay in time of crisis response, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the axe, including those who are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The list includes F35 fighter plane, the Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new combat ship coastline and the new combat vehicle on land that the Army and the Navy need to replace the HumVee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Halt development and the additional evidence of F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> As a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the most recent headlines shows us how serious and pervasive are deception and lies in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate Herman presidential is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accused of lying to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The trustees of the State University of Pennsylvania have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports which said that a football coach was withdrawn sexually abusing children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone saying the US president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> Congressman for New York and exhibicionista on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with their denials rebatidos quickly by the irrefutable proof. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of offences in the financing of the campaign related to the cover-up of an extra-marital relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And, again, no one who lived will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton during his second term by lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Are widespread legends about the traps in the examinations of school and university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been cases in which teachers have given the answers from the tests to students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors should be taught to the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How deception we are? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On any given day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> That is for sure, many of these lies are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that the unknown cheating three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detect lies, or &quot;the location of lies,&quot; is an essential skill to acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, charade, where the goal is to say: &quot;You have,&quot; the detection of deception is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars do look in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Does not always tartamudean, stuttering out, ruborizan or worry. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> We cannot conclude either that the liars are difficult to detect or expose. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A lie detector can be trained to learn the truth about the structure of the declaration, the expressions microfaciales, training of questions and the times. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include the recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and felt intuitively how others perceive. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> We know from research that the extrovertidos lie more than the introvertidos, that men are more telling &quot;lies geared towards themselves,&quot; while women say more lies &quot;geared towards others&quot; -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners that people who are not married (but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot;huge&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How to know if someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, observe the normal conduct of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &quot;to create a baseline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Aid to provide benchmarks to measure after the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Look at the position of the subject, laughing and vocal feature. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is better to know if someone normally golpetea with the foot all the time for not making accusations unfair when I see the golpeteando feet in the middle of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then, seek groups of misleading behavior, verbal and non-verbal. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as proof of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember their history, they can point their feet toward the door, leaning toward an exit, changing its position significantly or exhibit a &quot;confession postentrevista&quot; -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the hard questions have ended. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Interrogators are often falsely that the interview is over, only to find that postentrevista relief. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the last time while stated that his wife killed was alive, launching a search for her at the national level. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> People who cheat can also use a language distanciador: &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky...&quot; or repeat a difficult question in full. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal indicators are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Anyone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when a difficult question to answer: &quot;Well... to tell the truth... so what I was... in my view.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> That makes the response is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to uncover deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the adoption of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating the unions, while apaciguaba environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says he is ready to redirect the project to return to return it. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said on Monday night that move the pipeline planned outside the area of ecologically sensitive Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol in Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The manager of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project to explore potential new routes to avoid areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supplies. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real path of progress,&quot; said Representative Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible that apart from any decision until 2013, after next year&apos;s elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department&apos;s request, and they expressed its full support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The pipeline, 1,700 kilometres would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Lead 700,000 barrels per day of the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> For this, it would be necessary to crossed six states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Is hated by environmentalists, but beloved by the working groups, who have opted for the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The current environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department&apos;s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is whether the Member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton&apos;s campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because he was linked to TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child vomitara of fear </seg>
<seg id="1842"> A family of New York says that the music diva disk, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy in the lobby of his building in Manhattan, aterrando his youngest daughter to the point that vomitó of fear. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The tirade of the singer of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; frightened to Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, both suffered &quot;personality changes, sleeping disorders&quot; and &quot;increased its fear of strangers,&quot; says his family in the Supreme Court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year when the scene-shifter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of kindergarten, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk fell at the entrance of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with their luggage, taking Genevieve. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Roseanna Monk said that stopped near the door and put her daughter in the soil for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone came up and said, &apos;Do you know what you are doing your daughter?&quot; He said&apos; yes&apos; and I went to take it, &quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> LaBelle admonished angry the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;In an aggressive tone, said,&quot; We should have left his daughter near the door, &quot;said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I told him, &apos;I have no interest in what you say or think.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> It infuriated and began to use bad words - the word and the word J C aloud... </seg>
<seg id="1852"> He had a bottle of water and began to throw the water from the bottle on me. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Said that Genevieve was hysterical. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> &quot;I said to her, &apos;Look what I have done to my daughter,&quot; said the mother of the girl. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> LaBelle rushed towards the mother -- who still rioters to Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by his entourage and retreat to a car that the expected, said Roseanna Monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The small was crying so strong that vomitó, he added. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but there was no response. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle not returned calls for comment on what happened. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&apos;s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money that manages to an association of support for children with cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for their behavior,&quot; said Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially when it leads to a kindergarten teacher that leads up to an 18-month-old baby.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Climate adversity halt the economy </seg>
<seg id="1863"> During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, fell foreign investment and the economy shrank </seg>
<seg id="1864"> The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, which generated great expectations to developments in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of start of the year, there is growth, instead it is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing billions in losses for the agricultural sector, limited the scope of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic collapse of 31.16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> According to the report of the impact of frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, had damage to 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which the 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the victims were the main crops of vegetables, corn and chick peas, lupin. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year saw a rapid growth, because while from January to March 1,053 sinaloenses 55 were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and the average between July and September continued rising to 6.19 percent, a rate that number of people cast more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Lesser liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifaceted, to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions of public policy have been made. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> &quot;What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for effects of a restriction of resources for the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, as for the people who he seizes dollars illegally is not easy for the work, and used to invest in something&quot;, he said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Detained migration </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Lopez Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment, there is also a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &quot;The number of people who are going to the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering already have too many difficulties in finding work, these people is falling and is demanding jobs here in the state, which means that unemployment rises,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> Court validates &quot;analogue switch-off&quot; in Mexico in 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The switch from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes that brought the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called &quot;analogue switch-off&quot; from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to overturn it. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, found that the President Felipe Calderón is not exceeded its authority by issuing the decree detailing the actions to make the transition to digital terrestrial television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this outcome, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of the decree or Unconstitutionality, and this is in force. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> The draft judgment drawn up by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, owing to the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a right reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Voted in favour of the draft only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Moon and own Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to contest the decree, and to accept the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions as he prepared for the digital transition. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> Full of ministers decided to dismiss the case brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without going to the discussion of the draft, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> In his speech, the president said does not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules measures so that the public administration prepare. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;Nor do I believe that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,&quot; and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector within the federal executive, who is constitutional mandate, the stewardship of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The switch from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, &quot;because it covers economic, social, political and national security.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1926"> These issues, he stressed, &quot;require the operation of the whole system established under the principle of economic stewardship of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the state Executive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Recalled that a large number of countries around the world has already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> We cannot conclude that the Executive, challenged by issuing the decree, which will in any way the purview of Congress, since it is providing administrative enforcement of laws issued by the Legislature, he assured. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Look at the possibility of a count &quot;vote by vote&quot; in Michoacán </seg>
<seg id="1930"> According to data produced by the Prep the difference between first and second place in the election for governor is only 27 per cent, even without the votes counted for 879 6,000 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> The possibility of counting &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality in terms of the electoral process this year in Michoacan, where according to data produced by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (Prep) the difference between first and second place in the election for governor is only 27 per cent, even without the votes counted for 879 6,000 74 minutes total. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> In this regard, the chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, barely on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize the local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> As you will remember, Miachoacán not accredited its Constitution nor his Electoral Code of the state or its Electoral Justice Act, which Congress approved reforms of the state shortly before the legal deadline for concluding that could come into force in the current electoral process and the governor, Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication on schedule in the Official Periodic Law of the State, on the grounds that he had some reservations. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) settled the dispute constitucional promoted by the local legislature and described as &quot;illegal and invalid&quot; the vote of the state agent to constitutional reforms, which does not have the right to &quot;punish or veto.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Interviewed on the possibility of the &quot;vote by vote,&quot; Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the remarks made by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to implement total and partial counts of the vote by the local electoral body. </seg>
<seg id="1936"> That way, the partial recount of votes, in one or more electoral packages, may be on the assumptions that: The results of the records do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the box or not in possession of the chairman of the same; or, if there are obvious errors or disruptions of the proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election will take place when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the election in question and which has won the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; if and when at the start of the sitting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that applied to the second of the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The total count of the vote will take place at the end of the counting if Extrabudgetary establishes that the difference between the candidate and the presumed winner located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, if and when there is a specific request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, in which case will be electoral packages that have been the subject of partial recount. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the Prep the difference between the first and second place is only with 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1977"> The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the chairman of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The Italian prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that can form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1980"> It is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the post. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Monti said that the president will submit the outcome of its talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> &quot;I would like to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult stage,&quot; said the former European Commissioner for journalists. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> &quot;The framework is now staccato,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the volatility of the markets posted the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, the Italian employers, told the press after meeting with Monti: &quot;We said that we would support a lot to this government.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy out of this emergency situation. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The chances of success of Monti were driven considerably by the support of the party LDP of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> &quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result,&quot; he said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> The support of the LDP, the biggest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had been opposed to the government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Parliamentary support </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> Monti began on Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women. </seg>

<seg id="2000"> After a brief respite at the end of the week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions about which politicians only give him time to implement the reforms before early elections. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that must be formed only by technicians, an indication of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Political sources noted that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures. </seg>

<seg id="2034"> The grouping is in the South American wing of his tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be their only scale in Central America. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m. column., along with the band Angelina The X and nationals of The Robertas. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is at The Nation on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> To his followers costarricenses, is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing their fan? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is only the second time in South and Central America and until now has been great. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I was in Costa Rica only once and holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> So excited that we carry our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fan living with intensity the previous days. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What do you say to their most ardent supporters? </seg>
<seg id="2044"> Thank you for staying on our side through all these years. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> We took almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people even refers to his concert as the largest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Does that adds a bit of pressure on his visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the larger shows that we have fallen over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We touch a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have put into shape for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> In truth, we are very eager to play there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How was that discovered Costa Rica and its waves to surfear? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> We have a lot of friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves there are incredible. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends are always going to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surfear; this was how we learn, by people who loves the surfing. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> To see the tour, have been handing out huge shows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What they have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> As we have never touched there before, then we do not have any restrictions on what we can do. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch on a couple of songs each album and give our fan a good and diverse repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat the repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why is this? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think it is partly because we have nine discs and can touch more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we are now not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of why we liked these songs and that we may have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it becomes more interesting for people. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of record. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Looking back, it is hard to believe everything we have achieved? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First, I believe that none of us can imagine that we would be in a large rock band and have done so for more than 20 years ago that seems like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We all want and we love to create music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate to go to places in the world to those who always wanted to go. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could not be better for us. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What it meant for you have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honour to be part of this group of big bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when a movement stems from a group of friends and is something rare. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time, there is a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come at the same time in the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honoured to be part of the group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Still we touch with some of them from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all of them still and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very strange that a band like you stand united and with the same members for so long. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) we joined 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much more time than last many gangs. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First, I believe that we are fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, have also been opened musical avenues that give freedom to each of experience. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> The relationship of you with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How find a balance sheet? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we have been growing, it has been easier to find a balance sheet. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We do not be too of tour because it is easy to fall into that game of the large crowds and the people who loves your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> While one remembers that people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought, without just concentrate on being famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really interested in. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How recalls his another project Mother Love bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I believe that we wrote songs and very good at the principle was something grand. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band for nearly three years and never published a disk until after he died Andy (Andrew). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> There were many frustrations because both duration and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how I was laughing, was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an amazing human being and we were shocked. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The national band The Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that you are familiar with his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why the chose to openness? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we are eager to see what The Robertas can offer in alive and must be very entertaining. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why are always changing the letter of Yellow Ledbetter live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings and I think that it does with the first thing that would happen. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> How downward, what are your influences? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Are so many. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many who could talk all afternoon on the bear that I love. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has managed to Pearl Jam maintain relevant the grunge despite not being a fashion? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think that all of us we always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I mentioned earlier, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there is relevant now, I think that is a wonderful thing because it is music that is worth listening and Mudhoney bands and music are doing better now than ever. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why is this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe songs that qualify as very dark, although it may sound a little positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard the songs and are deeply dark. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that when far and there are some trauma in your life and you lose to a family member or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and those two songs, surely, is that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Also, I think it can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark. </seg>

<seg id="2133"> Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now had never done in three dimensions: In &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; will fight for the love of the girl in High technology. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to seize the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> &quot;Mario is the person who has to say how to operate the estereoscopía without glasses,&quot; asserted the official press Nintendo specialized in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the videogame in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> Alvarez indicated that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first of Nintendo videogame originally intended for that support,&quot; because until now successes as &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, despite being in 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is a videogame &quot;accessible&quot; that allows us to enjoy a smooth and rapid departure. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Alvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: The first part is &quot;simple&quot; to the entrapment users less clever. </seg>

<seg id="2155"> The results of the first 25 years of life of the entity Trinijove social support is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received aid to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> Airports are over 100 jobs made today for this social group. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> The anniversary served yesterday to take stock at an event held in the old manufacturing complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradicción or fall in the margins. </seg>

<seg id="2166"> Vacated a farm where they were macrofiestas okupada </seg>
<seg id="2167"> The invaders had grabbed 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51 </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The 12 occupants left the farm midday yesterday without offering resistance </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived the neighbours of 51 of the street of Balmes has come to an end. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people left the building voluntarily midday yesterday that were illegally, and where organised macrofiestas desesperaban that the neighborhood, by court order and without the need of a police intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Ended when the operation, it changed the lock on the door to avoid a repeat of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &quot;From now on there will be a control of access,&quot; said the manager. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are habitados, were all part of the electrical and water, in addition to paint the walls and leave residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> The first three floors were the scene of mass celebrations, lasting up to two days and desesperaban tenants. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> On the side of the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also has been damaged. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the discotheque notes that the invaders from the farm is unfair competition, which sold the canopy to three euros, while in the discotheque worth 10. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> In addition, the owner of the local leisure had had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, as noted, not the cause inconvenience customers of the disco, but the inhabitants of the house okupada and, above all, those attending the celebrations organised there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors in the area. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The head of the disco explained that the inconvenience were so large that even came to an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that &quot;forgiven&quot; rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the last few weeks had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The Chairman of the group of the PP in the municipal council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week &quot;immediately vacate the property to deal with the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the okupas had gone entering all the floors of the building and in almost all the flats, and some even have been thefts. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense, he added that &quot;it is necessary to end impunity and be strong against the incivility that has been generated in the farm.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Also yesterday, the Mossos cleared a building in Nou Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 3.30 p.m. the police turned up to 35 of the streets of Mont-RALs, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people came to the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The four were arrested at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Does or mountain Park? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide with the opportunity of the convening beyond polemics on fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The municipal contest on the 16 door reopens the debate about the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Amediados of the 1980s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed Ones tracts of promoting Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> Is more, was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park New Yorker. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was placed in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not based in the north-south axis but above (mountain) abajo (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Collserola rating as a natural park is in this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the role of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 competitions for so many other doors to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> A door refers to the idea of park, without doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that or someone seeks to put doors to the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question goes alone: Collserola, or mountain park? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both for his side purely organisational and by what means of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the people of Barcelona architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost as a recurring theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected are recognized in an elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this gives rise, precisely, one of the few similarities between what they believe three architects people of Barcelona, and university teachers, which have been tabled. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: The contest is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán, having dealt with the coastline, &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;the face of the mountains,&quot; given that the speech Ildefons Cerdà, green apples, has not been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It is assumed that the park more extensive Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things for his great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;ruling the architect for whom the title of&quot; gates of Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap léxica &quot;: We must not think about them&quot; as the entrance to a park, but the demarcation of areas where we need to act. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, described the proposal &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Dangers of &quot;uncertain that is now projecting the public space&quot; after the experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the Fòrum &quot;his swan song.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the demarcation of borders on where they can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Limit is set for the next step,&quot; i.e., exceeding. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We need to think in new planning tools, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> More confined himself to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying the Collserola vallesana aspect of &quot;can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, not&quot;, by a matter purely topographic. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Mòdol reminds us that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat of that &quot;must not fall on deaf ears,&quot; though he was grateful for the opportunity that the City offers his body to intervene in this project, &quot;from the first moment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And even more, understands that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows the architects to enter the debate, but &quot;doubt&quot; about whether this is a technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success story,&quot; said) that have had to create: &quot;The architects should be only a tool.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayonne insinuated that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the tender lack a global vision of Collserola: &quot;There have been 16 revaluing transversal competitions in the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, watching and understands the area as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This causes, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> In other words, a project for one of the doors may clash in programme and definition of the architect of the next door. </seg>

<seg id="2236"> The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the crash that killed the secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven more people </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results on the accident which killed the secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without which the pilot could try a hard landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before taking off the plane, the pilot found that weather conditions were right to fly. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Also reported that the unit was designed to 19 people, so we had the requirements needed to transport staff. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, said that the inquiries made in the area of impact is not brings the emergence of pieces on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;In a search reported that there is no parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact was presented in a structural. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> &quot;The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, had subpoenaed suitable for shipped to passengers. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The ground presents a pending seven degrees to the 30 degrees of bias. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> For the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even a year could reach. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> For its part, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director-general of Airports and Related Services, asserted that at the moment of impact, the Chiefs of the Presidential helicopter operated in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ground upward. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information strengthens the assumption of a normal cruising at the moment of impact,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant element in the research: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual flight: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Under the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The reports in the AICM located right conditions at takeoff, the aircraft is moving towards the border area between the DF and the state of Mexico layers of cloud cover at low altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that the cloud the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Location the impact. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of impact and the last recording of the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of remains of the aircraft in a small area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available so far suggest that the impact occurred in a straight path and hand. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of dispersal of remains of the aircraft may assume that the helicopter was hit on the ground in terms of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Has not been detected evidence of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> At the site of the incident are still not be disclosed evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> Recent research results indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the work of countryside have been found pieces of the aircraft to an increase of 9,000,200 feet above mean sea level, the ground is a slippery from the seven degrees until 30 degrees of bias. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the sequence in which is expected to be disbanded along this route. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a thorough search in a wider area cordoned off the site, around the accident, have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The Social Insurance an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the negative tendencies towards </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, so-called protocol &quot;Temptation of obesity in children and adolescents&apos;, which will count with markers associated with overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in biochemistry of Medical Hospital Medical Center of the National 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that incorporated a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, social workers and nutriólogos. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (negative tendencies towards). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In research to be invited to participate in the beneficiary population or not, go to sports units of IMSS participants in the Valley of Mexico, which carried out the tests to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Stressed that the protocol began in Unity State of Mexico Sports Cuauhtémoc (west) and that since 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit (State of Mexico Middle). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once it complies with the aim of bringing 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independence Federal District (south) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify Mexicans risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> To be held this November 14 World Diabetes Day, saying that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Also asked about physical activity and background heredofamiliares of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that would trigger ailments such as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference of), the taking of blood pressure, blood glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (it seeks to identify genes that are associated with child obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz Lopez noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Health surveys of 1999 and 2006 pointed out that in just six years, there was an increase in the case of children, 77 per cent in obesity, and girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight is also observed a dramatic rise &apos;, highlighted the IMSS specialist. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is based on the country&apos;s population differs from other genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent in Europe and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect if they have some degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Indeed, he said, the presence of folds of dark color (acantosis) in neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood that suffer metabolic disorders and even prediabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is handled confidentially, doctors delivered by writing to the parents, who are explains each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be done to prevent disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: Sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the largest part of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport rather than walk short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e., the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high in fats and proteins and genetic analyses in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> UNAM would avoid bumpy asphalt </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Chemistry Faculty of UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the signals it sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair potholes around 200,000 every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is the right one, the potholes could be reduced in number, or even be eliminated entirely. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his conference A view of the technological potholes, handed down in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory to office develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater resistance mechanics, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera estimated that this kind of asfaltos modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, a high molecular weight, called asfaltenos, and other low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give him to the pavement viscoelástico his characteristic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Asphalt viscoelástico behavior is that to high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but which will be amended during the day in accordance with environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The investigator of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly covered by pavement flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the surface layers is the tar, composed of small stones covered in asphalt and then compacted. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each piedritas that constitutes the kit, pointed out, is awash with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> The transit vehicles and generated efforts, it allows the forces are spread very well on the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it were modified asphalt would be disseminated even better, felt the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> File on the tar, elaborated, it puts a final layer called rolling file, which is made of a material fine stone, i.e., a sand also washes in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, must have more force than the tar file mechanics and provide friction along the way. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> To be part of the pavement that is to receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling file requires, we also have the proper thickness and must take care of the material from which it is made. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because significantly affects the performance of the tar file. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the ground is wets, water spreads in the interior of the kit and it is difficult to leave, this causes a reblandecimiento of all sections of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of formation of a bump, he said, the first to become blunt is the film and only after rolling it affects the tar file, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should be given to the first signs with proper maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Also a member of the National System of Investigadores explained that the vehicle burden is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be used in connection with the burden and to ensure that it meets, to avoid potholes are frequently. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the tar emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and to repair the cracks easily and without the need to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What it lacked the Valley a candidate to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that affected to Melina Ramirez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> The Valle receives its title number 14 princess. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Again the Cauca Valley is left with the appetite of the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the band that credited as new princess of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and sceptre, the department has risen to 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women vallecaucanas who have been close to the crown but were proclamations princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domíngez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria solace Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Today, the big question that many are is what was lacking? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation showed that she had to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first is considered a key factor in the decision by the jury of designating First Princess is that were not impressed with his answer to the question, &quot;What is this book you set for yourself and why? Made by Martin MURILLO Gomez, Leamos literary cart. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The interrrogante the vallecaucana replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I think quite in literature, I think that is a form of culturalizarse, definitely I think that the book that I set of childhood is&quot; The Little, &quot;is a book rather deep. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Currently read &quot;Crime and Punishment,&quot; is a book of world literature that we all need to read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called &quot;The ardour of blood&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that little liked first by the term &quot;culturalizarse&quot; and second for not explain in particular how each of the books that have been cited. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But at the end of the ceremony Melina said feel calm and happy with the result, &quot;the universe is wise is what needs to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the people, please read a little bit, &quot;The Little&quot; is a great book &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Between the hypothesis dropped says that to Valle the burned the favoritism. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist used in Bogotá hinted that to be the favourite, the ovacionada and the candidate who had all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best traditional costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;that sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the Queen and therefore not shone in the scene.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And that it showed in his first appearance in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although in both lució safe, it was clear that lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed itself. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme &quot;As at home,&quot; Channel RCN opined that the fact that Melina outside designated princess&apos; notes that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not as queen. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle was at the last very elusive with the press, and that was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is in the past, the essence of the National Competition for beauty. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country which. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, who before entering the contest are already involved in projects,&quot; he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is also speculation that Valle was lethargic for their shortcomings in the derriere fibrosis and he noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate &apos;natural beauty &quot;with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparer queens Jorge Hernáan Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, &quot;but his problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very visible, I dropped points in the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile the journalist Guido holes, the magazine horse trading believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were surgery that was performed. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The surgeries are fine, but not the Valley was able to do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> His body was never his strong and here is the cost. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Competition Beauty, after the parade in swimming trunks emerged a cruel prediction that last night was, as it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo awarded to Melina so as not to give him a taste of the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Reality or not, the fact is that Melina from today begins a year reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives him the chance of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions for appointment of one&apos;s own National Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming step in Cartagena, was elusive the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> It was the work of caleño that identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A lofoscopista of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On 4 November, a lofoscopista CTI Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum leader of the FARC, &quot;Alfonso Cano,&quot; through the comparison of their fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the CTI seccional, this week visiting &quot;availability&quot; Eliazar Gonzáles, a man of Puerto Tejada leading 21 years working in the area of judicial inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the start of his career, Gonzáles worked in municipalities of collided, where many times had to enter the country for more than five days in the jungle to arrive at the site where the bodies were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000 was moved to the capital of Valle and then to make the appropriate courses, has specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say, the palms and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him that carry minimum clothes for three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big is expected. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday in the night went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I knew that was supposed to identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world&apos;s oldest guerrilla, so I asked him to carry the fingerprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, when it came to the research team to the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Was without a beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Fingerprints but do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> His eye is not ruled: Was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man who hails from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the maximum leader of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a dactiloscopista Sijín of Cali&apos;s recognition that made the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against &quot;grey&quot;, is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactiloscopia is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes such as theft and manslaughter and confirm the identity of those captured. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When caught, many criminals are false or bonds have no papers. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We will take fingerprinting and seek in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Told the investigator that, in a case of theft, I had to remove a piece of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported its power to draw a strong box full of jewels and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate to draw a land fingerprints, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in various thefts,&quot; recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints may also exclude or reaffirm suspects in murder cases. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently found a man dead, with bottles of spirits around them. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Through research, it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle was. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that was the killer, they located at the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A CTI dactiloscopista explained that the objects&apos; fingerprints are drawn with physical or chemical reagents. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, it uses a transplantador or tape to lift them. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the database delinquency, or to the Registry. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; said the CTI expert. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI. </seg>

<seg id="2381"> A large part the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement took Wall Street defied this Tuesday, authorities in New York to try to enter again, under the umbrella of a court order, to the square in Manhattan where they were evicted from early morning and try to occupy another park of the Big Apple. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> Hundreds of demonstrators agolpaban at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order allowing the &quot;indignant&quot; return to camp out in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupy a park further north of the city, where there has been new arrests. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> &quot;Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp out in the square, we are going to install somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,&quot; said one of the spokesmen of the movement &quot;took Wall Street,&quot; Mark Bray. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> Bray elaborated that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; at the eviction of his camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain camped out. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> In addition, the &quot;indignant&quot; proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> At least for an hour managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the demonstrators, although he could not confirm the specific figure, while Efe assured that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, which has already been sent a delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the Police. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a forum of private property remains closed pending the conclusion of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which they must examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Posted some of the demonstrators were carrying so far at this time and distributed copies of the court order and even delivered to the players who were guarding the square, causing &quot;some small clashes,&quot; said Bray, who complained that some officers beat the demonstrators. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> The court order prohibits the authorities to evict members of took Wall Street or implement &quot;laws that were published after the occupation began or ban protesters to re-enter the park with tents or other properties that used previously.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2392"> The Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> District personally defended the eviction carried out dawn of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which they proceeded to around 200 arrests and that it was decided because the protesters were &quot;violating the law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the place because it was turning &quot;in a place where people were not to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others,&quot; because &quot;some businesses had received threats&quot; and neighbors feared &quot;for their quality of life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2395"> &quot;The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of &apos;lack of respect for freedom of expression. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Those responsible for &quot;took Wall Street&quot; also indicated that they intend to organise &quot;great actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months for the protests, which began on 17 September. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special television </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Alongside Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television programme &quot;It&apos;s to Russell Peters Christmas&apos; next December 1 </seg>
<seg id="2399"> The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen in &quot;Home Improvement,&quot; lifeguard on &quot;Baywatch,&quot; conejita &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas Canadian television. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the &quot;crooner&quot; (baladista) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television programme &quot;It&apos;s to Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on 1 December, giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> CTV today distributed pictures of the television programme in which Anderson, also known by the wide distribution on the Internet of pornographic housekeeper a video in which appears along with her then husband, the battery of &quot;Mötley Crüe,&quot; Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a jack representing Jesus. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as a presenter on part of the tour &quot;My violent torpedo of Truth&quot; Charlie Sheen, appears as José. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Christmas special of CTV account with the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires by Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that there is no stranger to controversy. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Recently, Bublé called &quot;should&quot; to the American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> Japan is reborn after the earthquake </seg>
<seg id="2406"> GDP grows 1.5 percent thanks to the domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country which suffered from Japan&apos;s since World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the government Tokyo material losses estimated at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figure of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is, moreover, the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery is explained, in part, for the rally of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> Indeed, companies increased their investment in a 1.1%, compared to 0.9% decline in capital expenditure to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> However, the real trigger of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invites to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan&apos;s GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan&apos;s currency -- has become one of the &quot;values haven&quot; selected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for US, a privilege that hangs like a bombshell in the accounts of exporting companies. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic survival is determined by the health of large groups of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota or Sony, for example, blaming their weak results between July and September to the value of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets remain with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lower our guard. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> &quot;We must be vigilant to the risks that persist, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said yesterday, the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of the Member countries presented in September more visible signs of economic slowdown. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing down. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to $100.8 in August. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> The euro zone, even, stood below average, which is at the level of 100, the rush to the eight tenths 99.13 points. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Athens is to feed doubts </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Papadimos said that it will approve the adjustments, but the Conservatives do not sign any written commitment </seg>
<seg id="2429"> With risk premia peripheral fired and uncertainty reinstated in the wooden floors, Greece is still stumbling into the maze that leads towards the exit of the great European debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional government Helleno comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels for a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed with facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days agreed on his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, claimed that will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its call for new elections for the scheduled date, on 19 February. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> &quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October,&quot; asserted Papadimos yesterday by opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> However, the message of Samaras not dispels doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to any more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader was taking a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that should unlock the 8 million that Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that it will give its approval to any letter of commitment to meeting the adjustments. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, escocida even by the impact caused by the referendum órdago Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that his demand is strong: Not released the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties helenos does not sign &quot;a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government, &quot;what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche&quot; of 8 million, although there is no deadline. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> The Greek knot still has thread for now. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Mrs Sofia: &quot;Are instruments for progress and hope &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The Queen highlights the place &quot;dominant&quot; of Spain in relation to this type of finances </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Has reached a major place globally in the role of the microfinanzas.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become these last two decades in the second donor in relation to this raises a tool of cooperation, whose &quot;essence&quot; pointed out that lies in being an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The Queen opened yesterday the V World Summit of microcredit in Valladolid with the belief that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that is kind of operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, especially, as anyone who has the goal of halving the volume of people living on less than a dollar a day, with which sets the poverty threshold. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;is working&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries&apos; to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with &quot;responsibility,&quot; said Sofia, who waited that initiatives and contributions that originate in the summit, which runs until Thursday, &quot;ensure the creation of new skills and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women,&quot; main beneficiaries of these loans. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> Are &quot;many achievements&quot; and &quot;many of the challenges we face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Summit of microcredit arises not only as a forum for discussion, but also as a platform to promote &quot;two basic goals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2447"> Thus, His Majesty explained that it aspires to be the end of 2015,175 millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and that 100 million of those homes out of the poverty line in the living. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The momentum in the concept of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path that began years ago a pioneer&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, I emphasise Sofia as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2449"> And is that described the father of this tool as a &quot;universal idealistic admirable in the cause of the fight against poverty,&quot; whose work known for 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn on the ground its policy of loans. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other events, such as those held in Côte d&apos;Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;I saw all the continuing evolution,&quot; explained Her Majesty, whose link with this project gave him yesterday described as the &quot;head of family&quot; gathered in Valladolid on the part of the &quot;baquero of the poor.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Finally, the Queen Sofia concluded his speech by encouraging people to participate in the discussion and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The foreign minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for all democratic state. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense, explained that it would be a mistake to link the cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom, because it is a &quot;permanent obligation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jimenéz found that microcredit pose &quot;a serious policy and rigorous dedicated to eradicate poverty,&quot; and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let this be a victim of the cuts. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In Spain, the microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2457"> For his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the &quot;success&quot; of giving &quot;confidence&quot; people &quot;from whom all the doors&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of the Riva, welcomed the present to a city that &quot;opens infected the spirit of solidarity.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the President by universal suffrage </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democrat party. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> Initially had not been included on the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the government&apos;s policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, it took almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Of the 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation for several minutes to be won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Finance Minister, will allay any doubt as possible. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main thrust of the Chancellor, and the motion, are summed up in a slogan: The response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to open way in Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to enable strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any event, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Without doubt, it is unlikely that the 27 quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy, too. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the ball is on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to ponder the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously would strengthen the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Eager to calm tempers within his party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is it has tried to win its conference at the expense of the &quot;small&quot; European countries or distressed countries willing to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of &quot;the Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel has not-discussed in France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Except passing. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The incidence of fraud in the sick leave </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the subsidies, the UMP and the government launched an offensive against the sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, as recurring since 2007, the fight against fraud and causing social. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Moreover, to accompany such offensive, that part of the desire to save rigorously, but even so reminiscent of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, to implement budget cuts: The government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of absence before they can take the low. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In short, unless there is a specific company, a worker who fall ill would lose four days of pay, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that would save $280 million, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> In addition, would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic: Impose officials a day of absence without pay in the event of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> As we discuss these issues, the majority is put on the table the issue of fraud, this time focused on the abuses of parental leave. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Will be increased considerably controls and, furthermore, if someone was caught in a fraud, it must reimburse the amounts,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> Indeed, since 2002 is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies that normally have borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Look at carefully, first of all, the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the French Institute of social security (NCWA), in 2006 were paid more than 237 million in benefits for low labour. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute research and documentation in health economics, subsidies for the low accounted for, in 2008, 5% of health care spending, rising to 11.3 million. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to the sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Consequently, 2.5% of spending on health care. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have picked up an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average that, without doubt, hides deviations: Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75 percent of the French respondents claimed 40,000 employees who had not taken a single day of sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were more protracted. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Fraud has a fairly limited scope. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to the controls of the sick leave more than 45 days are systematic. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that short-term casualties were &quot;unjustified or too long,&quot; i.e. 37,050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subject to regular inspections, it was found that 11% of cases were &quot;properly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting as a total of 1.2 million, $132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Consequently, there is a total of 169,000 cases &quot;unjustified&quot; among several millions of workers who caught a sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Without doubt, a figure insignificant compared with, for example, the black economy. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 billion a year, or more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, without doubt, considerably more than the fraud in this area. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to straighten out its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; also added that the 100 days that have been given to his government of union would not be sufficient to achieve that goal. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> &quot;To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment,&quot; said the head of government, he uttered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the &quot;primary task&quot; of the new government, because it &quot;is at stake,&quot; the permanence of the country in the euro area, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Accordingly, Papadémos has predicted that the country&apos;s public deficit will be &quot;until about 9%&quot; of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching a 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right rejects new austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday its support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> &quot;We will not vote in favour of new measures,&quot; he said during a meeting with members of his party &quot;New Democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Said that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and the EU does not desbloquearían the loan of 8 billion euros needed written without a guarantee of support from all parties of the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and would not accept anything because of outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> A committee of experts says that should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide </seg>
<seg id="2520"> Canadians live denying the death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society living denying the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Indeed, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to that effect. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is a formidable of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and doctor. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommended the government to amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> For a start, the experts cited a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada ranks 10th post, the study notes that &quot;medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians want to die at home, just 68.6% of them died in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Overall, the highest rate in this regard the records Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the stance of the federal government, which has already declared that he does not want to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all the countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offense has not led to an abuse of its implementation, i.e., the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or who had not given their consent. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, we saw more excesses in those countries where there have been legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> &quot;Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> &quot;Canada is assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal,&quot; explains Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians, pro-euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> Let us remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that would allow people whose death is next to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid made in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> In addition, 66% believes that the fact legalise euthanasia will not to understand that the life of the elderly or disabled has less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> To the people who have been assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believed that should not begin proceedings against them. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Moreover, among its recommendations suggest that in the penal code indicating that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The committee of experts also calls for training for health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient will reject the attendance at the end of their lives without fear to deal with a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer. </seg>

<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as &quot;extreme&quot; the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it restricts the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> &quot;This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide,&quot; said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any other value of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> However, it adds that &quot;in society, there are labels and limitations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2551"> The health law specialist in Margaret Somerville also expressed its &quot;strong opposition&quot; with regard to the conclusions of the report, which described as &quot;manifesto in favour of euthanasia.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2596"> A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has worked with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used in a nuclear weapon, according to said on Monday, an American NGO specialising in the nuclear risk. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> For the identification of the investigator, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and in other documents issued by the agency of the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> IAEA last week expressed its &quot;grave concern&quot; for a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> According to ISIS, based in detail in documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960&apos;s, in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> In 1989 and 1991, would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of &quot;nanodiamantes&quot; in Kiev. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> The economic problems of their company would have led to contact in 1995, with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> Later, it is believed that cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In its latest report, the IAEA says that there are &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a nuclear detonation system &quot;with the help of an expert abroad, which not only knew well the technique, but also, as reported by a Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of their country of origin.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2605"> The crimes and crimes against Muslims have risen nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., has risen by 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 percent in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and offences anti-religious. </seg>

<seg id="2623"> Introduction of a &quot;golden rule&quot; in the Constitution budget </seg>
<seg id="2624"> The grand coalition Government of Social Democrat/Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible deterioration of the sovereign note of Austria by rating agencies (triple-A). </seg>
<seg id="2625"> It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision following a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the upper limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> &quot;If you reduce the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay $3 million more in interest each year,&quot; said the Christian Democrat Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Austria responds to a request from the Brussels summit to member countries of the eurozone last 26.10.98: In it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or an Act equivalent value. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> The measures adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the &quot;German model&quot;, as Germany was the first European country that took that kind of &quot;rule.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2629"> By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease each year in a 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal government&apos;s structural budget deficit should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> The aim is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> A strong yen </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Noda threat with a new exchange market intervention </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again the marking of change if the yen continued to rise. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> &quot;We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we see that there is an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda told the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> On Tuesday, the yen was up to levels close to the record highs that produced the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan&apos;s currency, which had reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the US currency. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> But the yen has been increasing steadily since then, driven by purchases of investors who see it as a &quot;value refuge&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2642"> The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter (1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2643"> But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the &quot;economic foundations of Japan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2644"> The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday, a two-day meeting of its monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen. </seg>

<seg id="2664"> Tuesday morning, the yield on the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered a 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> These tensions in connection with interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, are stoking fears of conductors. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for time to markets in order to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being smothered under the weight of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 October would be the &quot;primary task&quot; of his government. </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts must assert more than the dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with considerations of short-term or simply thinking about emotions, is energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is appropriate that an electoral meeting is the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be useful only if studying all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must base its opinion on objective facts, rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic trends will result in the doubling of demand for electricity by 2050 unless it deprives a huge part of the world&apos;s population of a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, we will have to alleviate the increasing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima does not change any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case or Belgium, which makes its way to the need to find a source able to replace it, nor of Switzerland, which only aims to build power plants in the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, are forward with determination with their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to the park, picking up the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes as an example, the reality is against such a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin will lead to a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on imported gas increased the need, in particular Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions for the construction of gas and coal plants. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> In a few months, will be felt the harmful effects. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> We must think about the case of Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champion in the wind industry, which gets 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the wind intermittency; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours paid an electricity bill 40% higher than the French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, French companies benefit from cheaper electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would realism to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> It is a price that the vast majority of the French are refusing to pay and, in fact, are not opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Largely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of small and medium-sized enterprises specializing in international markets and non-relocatable that can create jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, would be the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of $6 million annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What would an electrician EPR designed to operate 60 years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, as there is a diabolical source. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary nature of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have a security authority that exerts tight control and transparent on both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Just one, the Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; not provocó consequences or to people or the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and a human error unforgivable. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR design presents a capable of resisting such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While the study all the players who want to build an electric power station, the termination of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to competitors from Areva and EDF, because that would leave them a free hand to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and they have a command partisan maneuvering such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Immigration, is a burden or an opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: The saturation of the police services, judicial and administrative subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with self-proclaimed the status of &quot;country of human rights&quot; of France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students who jumped to the headlines, with the Ministry of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclaiming of past that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> However, rarely discusses from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction in 1976, declaring that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers,&quot; while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot take care of all the misery of the world&quot; in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory for a multitude of Polish plumbers. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> On both sides, it considers that immigrants are a burden for the French economy and society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the extent of generosity with which act with regard to immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include trivia, indicating that the co-development will solve the problem of migration. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is profitable electorally, but economically is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As economists point Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that sums up the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 PP.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Limiting immigration weakens growth and is detrimental to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, pushing to reduce their salaries. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for national workers and are mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract national and the most skilled workers in dynamic sectors where the training does not meet the demand for staff. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> A positive effect on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that has a lack of anaesthetists, complementarity between citizens and immigrants causes the arrival of recent will impact positively on wages and employment of nationals. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Taking into account the above, Giovanni peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows is a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that provide immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of Nobel laureates and naturalized American companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, because they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less costs) of 150,000 euros in public budgets on average throughout his life. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek the points of growth that he lacked &quot;with teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, you only need to think in a European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset, but also fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to remember it because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some may have believed that, for democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies, would be enough to vote and the most direct way possible. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know, since Napoleon &quot;Little,&quot; that it was something thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and even can become an instrument of oppression, &quot;as the philosopher Etienne Vacherot formerly Republican. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis that we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but is on the verge of becoming a political crisis and democratic. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The Greek referendum palinodia of true-false had, in this regard, revealing a double effect: Showed the need for a strong return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its failure, his inconsistency. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> Must consider this ambivalence to overcome it. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the front lines of the battle democrática have now been moved and, in many cases, soldiers Republicans no longer are moving in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Stands to gain if not demand a succession of national referendums, organized around the needs and disorderly manner. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank cheque to the European monarch absolute or a high into the void of the nationalist hole: What options for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want to coups, but a joint exercise, fully-fledged, calm and steady, options and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would have no idea where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> The whole of Europe is that it is bowing to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe suffers a humiliation in the international arena. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is slowly losing the sovereignty and, with it, every one of their nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The most urgent is that popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is only together can Europeans to reduce the weight of its debts, free markets and prepare for their future through investments. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that may not be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Having fought for a long time against this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone calls today a European economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> That it. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But think about it without further political integration and democratic, and without being seen as such by the citizens, it would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take a new stage of European integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;do&quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson remains applicable. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Need to build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> To build Europe, do Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Chip cards with &quot;no contact&quot; is widespread </seg>
<seg id="2773"> Lounge global chip cards began on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an environment optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> Indeed, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, telephone SIM card, etc.), with a total of 6 million units, according to calculations Eurosmart cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The segment is the most powerful technology without contact, which allows us to pay the transport in common purchases or simply approaching the card at a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Should continue to increase its share in 2012 (includes 580 million units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for cards with chip cards (6,925 million). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe, which has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the area of payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Around 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, its beginnings are more modest: They are using 400,000 Visa cards without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> But the supermarkets are working for four. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To get the gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to its customers. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;There are two major French establishments that have been undertaken to disseminate systematically in the future, among its customers, bank cards without contact with the system,&quot; announces Gérard Nébouy, director-general of Visa Europe France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks tested the payment for mobile phone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: The mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> At present, there are few devices equipped with the technology NFC (near Field Communication), essential to make transactions. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;Are falling behind.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But should finally see a real boom next year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We anticipate that it will sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 throughout the world,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But banks take the lead. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The bank Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone are equipped to around 200 customers and partners with a sheath that allows the payment without contact. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> And the Société générale also said yesterday that he is preparing the marketing of an offer to allow their customers pay without contact via their mobile. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> The links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, on which they suspected for some time, have been confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers already &quot;has the certainty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2800"> &quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,&quot; explained, without providing further details. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by people associated with AQIM, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> In the rubble of the intervention, French researchers discovered several Nigerian and telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Of terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The study of calls made indicates to several players based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers attracted the interest of researchers: One leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, presumably, is close to AQIM and the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is progress, but certainly we should expect to have more formal evidence before talk of operational cooperation between Boko Haram and AQIM.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;But it is possible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign financial support and intellectual and that is increasingly active,&quot; says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In recent months, these &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex, and in the same style than those used by AQIM. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, starting with Washington is pressuring Abudja since then to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considering the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> A success fast </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In this poor region, the association is experiencing a quick success. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Be politicized and requires a strict observance of Sharia law, while its militants launched the fight against the central government godless. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> These are the first to churches, pubs, administrations. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and multiplied attacks on police stations. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> The Abudja reaction was, as so often happens, widespread. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army attacked the town and there were 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Since then, the sect is radicalizing and abandoned their fiefdoms in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Last Christmas, calls for an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another in Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> In June, Boko Haram returns to attack against Muscat, particularly against the headquarters protected by the police, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes his first international goal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> The creation of an axis of terrorism in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria, anxious to all security specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> While AQIM has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to &quot;share all the information.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2830"> The world according to the Republican candidates for the Presidency </seg>
<seg id="2831"> In relation to China, with Iran and with the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman presidential and Rick Perry vie in naivety and lack of knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic? </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that is the case. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman presidential, Rick Perry and the other candidates are becoming more statements estruendosas and shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Extend the slogans, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, aid to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination for the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to take China to the WTO and denouncing them &quot;by manipulating its currency,&quot; a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector towards Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> As if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that &quot;apabulla &apos;emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Has called for a dialogue, but constructive, with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman, which is stalled in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> Reagan-style </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> &quot;If re-elected, will stop Iran,&quot; fanfarroneó. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> &quot;If Obama gets re-elected, they will have the bomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in its obligations in connection with this partner. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The businessman Herman Cain, the second candidate best classified, shows for its part a shameful lack of such issues. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently, urged to counter the military threat of China because Beijing &quot;is trying to develop nuclear capability&quot;, apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The Texan, Mr Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US military in Mexico to combat the drug cartels. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009, will also recommend Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> There are considerable differences with the Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current President Reagan answered that also had a simple ideas and who won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> Insist, with reason, in the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit from the &quot;boys&quot; of Iraq and its distortions in Libya, and labeled as weak. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> But the attacks are not simple. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population is of a more positive assessment of Obama&apos;s national security, which ended with bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> In Iraq, is wary of military interventions that generate a collapse. </seg>
<seg id="2857"> And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair. </seg>
<seg id="2858"> The Nord Stream, new gateway of Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> To supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia with Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have been together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, will each year 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe via a first had to 1,224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second tube should be concluded by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, that is to say, enough to cover the entire French consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Moreover, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube for the same way. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project presents an air of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Poland and the Baltic countries had been firmly opposed to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Indeed, Nord Stream will allow supplying gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course land for third countries (Poland and Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> In one fell swoop, these two countries are losing some of its power: For them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatened to block access to the markets of Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw has not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new German-Soviet pact,&quot; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Is, if the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, supporting the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a rift between the Eastern and Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has known, in just five years, to succeed his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and Western countries rich, big consumers of gas reserves and increasingly limited. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organically,&quot; confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing the extent to which the big gas contracts are as political as well as economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the managers of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The submarine is made of steel tube cement covered to protect it against the anchors of ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Rests on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 metres deep. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, for caution,&quot; says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream society. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Also became necessary step up measures to protect the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The tube is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: Or valves, or maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> Scheduled a platform of control in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced the same to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society was permanently in the sea off its shores. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In case of breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak, the gas pipeline will be released to the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But the builders considered unlikely that there will be a leak, because they have planned gaskets, according to forecasts, will have a flight per 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, which is carrying out external inspections, as well as through a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> With the shape of a cigar, introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of a metre, and moves with gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on potential deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any kind of redress. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The movement of the gas is simply because of the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The principle is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The company is leader Gazprom, which owns 51 percent of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> To her, joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Later, Gazprom rented to this society, for a renewable term of 25 years, all the gas transport capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really transport,&quot; said Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the input of shareholders and 70% through bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 million for the two tubes. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached the 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But minority shareholders are sure that does not exceed their investment, because Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Baltic emerges the pipeline in Lubmin, in a sandy coast planted pine. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Some valves, with 4.5 metres high, form the exit door of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are a few sensors that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a report card. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> Created a half-century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for the script. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> Has an air of adventure, hours of writing to light a candle. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pasta, his gum, their white sheets broke, as aging at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current side were born... in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to market a notebook of design, but distinguished. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Mr. Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, saw the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The book was inspired by an ancient technique of production, though the skinheads (skin of mole), which refers to a cotton barnizado that was used, among other things, to cover the stools. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This kind of book was highly valued by the writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an object old and forgotten, an icon of the pioneering artists until the 20th century,&quot; Maria Sebregondi account, which since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> And reached the success. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Far remained confidential production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 books were designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine goes beyond the borders of Italy and exported their products in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-mindedness and cults. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which had 12 workers in its infancy, now owns nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: One in Milan and the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> Distributes its basis in bookshops, from the FNAC until small shops in the centre of the cities, and has managed to impose its identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails,&quot; explains Maria Mr. Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This signature cultural goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched the exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects and artists out his own book. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, also launched a notebook with lids of leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Taking advantage of its success and this aura cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify their products: Handbags, agendas, pens, computer blankets... The marks covers a wide range of media. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success that causes envy: In the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund GS Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, written a new page in the history of Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> The 15th Week for the employment of the disabled begins today. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is twice the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> How daunting? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No,&quot; says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of the disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress made since 15 years ago are considerable. </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;However, there is still much to be done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It is worth mentioning that the unemployed disabled still face numerous obstacles to access to employment. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> They tend to have an older age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Have a little high level of qualification: 80% has not finished high school, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> That is to say, there are many issues that impede the return to the world of work and that &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; says Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, a partnership founded in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> These are the obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> In addition, there are those who have not been mentioned; the mentality of the people moving, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study carried out in April by the association for the IMS-entreprendre Cité indicated that the directors surveyed have &quot;a level of knowledge on disability under&quot;, with an &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result: Private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law... 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, reach a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;Now we reached around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The test: The number of establishment &quot;subjected to this contribution,&quot; like the sums disbursed, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from $59 to $46,000 (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure for businesses,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially among the large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies that have between 20 and 49 workers account with disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82% of companies of between 100 and 199 employees. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;A joy &apos; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> About to face the bleus Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that creates this match. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> We dare not say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side, on the podium in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really have made amends. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the gesture of resentment of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian selector has no more than praise for him. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I was very pleased by Eden, for their progress and Belgian because it is.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I want to move forward,&quot; he responds the striker of Lille. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> In terms of the contrast between their presentations in his team and in the selection, &quot;is a whole,&quot; has been justified. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;In Lille, I am all year, which does not apply to Belgium. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;I have to put myself.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Convened to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis, finally, &quot;shine.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without forget the &quot;pleasure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2970"> Has been encouraging the bleus since he was seven years, as well as during the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I have always been a fan,&quot; says. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> Without doubt, this will strengthen the character &quot;particular&quot; of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> Especially because they face &quot;Mathieu Debuchy, Yohan Cabaye and Adil Rami,&quot; recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We have just face recently. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Playing against them is always a joy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> With simplicity, Leekens has done its part by reference to &quot;pride&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;Pride&quot; in play &quot;a gala party.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Pride&quot; also by check, as &quot;a neighbour,&quot; France &quot;is becoming a team of very high level,&quot; nearly a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,&quot; he said with enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share with the plane bleus towards... Brazil in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;Our small Belgians are growing,&quot; he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;To see it in the next few games.&quot; Including the match against France. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal shows great confidence </seg>
<seg id="2985"> Portugal&apos;s Paulo Bento is faced with a great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> In the one-party, lacked realism to both teams. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;When within these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> There is no doubt; the Selecçao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> Indeed, just 90 minutes separate Portugal of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a party that play and a rival, Bosnia, that defeat. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> Bearing in mind the party trip (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the matter is not resolved. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not make the valuable goal that would have given the tranquillity. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;It is a good result, but at the same time, carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> But at home, in the bright Stade de la Luz of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that will pass, before an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the party &quot;is well matched,&quot; Bento dixit an optimistic but lucid. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We hope that the party is well matched, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead,&quot; said the Portuguese coach for 42 years. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012,&quot; has, however, put the successor of Carlos Queiroz. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Friday the stalemate in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Bosnians they could get a draw, but also need to make. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;It is a good result, but at the same time, carries a risk, because we have not scored away from home,&quot; Bento regrets. </seg>
<seg id="3001"> &quot;We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and we have players with a great individual quality,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercise, from the outset, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;do not give them time to think.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3003"> A good idea, provided that, this time, is realistic. </seg>
