<seg id="1"> No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by the Parliament </seg>
<seg id="2"> Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to abolish those clauses in the context of a revision of the Penal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The members of Parliament at the second reading of the application to mitigate the punishments for economic fraud rejected the new rules which would have can pave the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October due to the conclusion of a supposedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the condemned in court should be negotiated in December. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Timoshenko itself referred to the ruling as political revenge of the regime and also in the West of the process was the suspicion of bias of the Court. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The proposal to remove paragraph 365, the former Prime Minister was convicted on the basis, of the Penal Code was supported by 147 members. </seg>
<seg id="8"> 226 Votes would have been necessary to its adoption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Libyan victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> The history of Libyan liberation or Libyan rebellion has already their losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert, and without him the war is over. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now, only the winners are to define. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As usual, win him this region in the elections of Islamists, the question is which - the moderate or the radical only. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The National Transitional Council known to the common law of the Scharīʿa from which you now have some idea when God. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya would the country without crime, because for stealing one hacks in short from the hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women should forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any religious apostasy will be executed, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of a single dictator, the company themselves will in future United mutually feuding tribes of the Qur&apos;an. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In short – in Libya an order that would be in this country hardly imaginable and in particular hardly desirable will prevail. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Only - our lifestyle is now times not the only and objectively probably also not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans variety. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Viewed it rather surprising, is that the Muslim fighters at all of the infidel dogs help left. </seg>
<seg id="21"> To their apology, probably only the fact may serve the air strikes of NATO not by any General from America, but from Allah himself were taken, whose Allmacht was praised after each successful hit. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The winners in Libya? The West is not include. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We took part only in a shootout, served the interests of Islam and our politicians from in the person of the dictator of a political allies without having this brought any advantage. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and the Iraq we saw rather from a military occupation of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thus the natives are the expulsion of the Crusaders a concern RID - namely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Get the oil companies but also without occupation of the black gold to the dirt cheap? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Hardly and so the West can boast once rightly his selflessness in terms of protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If the representatives of Scharīʿa not this ruin them. </seg>

<seg id="60"> Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech Mannschaftkonnten the Montenegrins only in the second half more under pressure set. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The unlucky of the lot were fired Damjanovic and Vucinic, the two huge opportunities. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech the Czech selection will mix with so next year at the European Championships, it is also gratifying that a premium amounting to about 200 million flows to local football. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The menu of an obese child: It not breakfast and eat sausage for dinner </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are overweight. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Current polls proved to be - obese children come mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Demonstrates once again the environment is as important for the healthy development of a person, in which he grows up and the examples are surrounding him. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more frequently on the table, as in families in which normal-weight children live. </seg>
<seg id="82"> More than 19 percent of overweight children had French fries for dinner the day before while under the motto &quot;Obesity is no accident&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families with fatties also sports not just to the hobbies, what concerns but also the majority of today&apos;s students - replied only 15 per cent, is one that is her parents find least once in a week time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, while nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic were interviewed. </seg>
<seg id="86"> This was already the second year of the action &quot;Obesity is no accident&quot;, which is supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th took part in the project classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors which are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with obesity or even obesity. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Only half of the interviewed children stated for example, five times a day, in the mode to eat - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet breakfast second breakfast lunch Vesper dinner&quot;, is one of the results of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="90"> No breakfast and sausage for dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts point out that relative small things, such as important are the regular breakfast time in the family, for the healthy development of a child. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic, but only 23 percent of the families of the students have breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="93"> And in most families, each on its own breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The finding was the worst that ever is not breakfast in every tenth family. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is as a cornerstone of healthy daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The survey test brought among other things on the day that you consumed more often unhealthy French fries in the families of overweight children. </seg>
<seg id="97"> And almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drink sweet soft drinks (70 percent) every day </seg>
<seg id="98"> Although more than 40 percent of surveyed children play sports, but only less than half of their parents do that - only 15 percent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Make up your own menu you </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) from facilities offered to appetite and opinion to assemble their own diet. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &quot;What prefer Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="102"> There were many pastries, meat dishes and of course sweets among their favorite foods. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Above all the large popularity of sweet soft drinks is alarming,&quot; stresses in the final report on this survey. </seg>
<seg id="104"> At lunch, so the main course, pasta just before poultry won. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Pulses almost not at all liked children and also the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunch was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Come out to the health </seg>
<seg id="107"> The survey also showed at the same time that the children are quite prepared to change their eating habits, if they get the correct information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> It is listed in the results of the project &quot;In the control group of the Umfragebeteiligten completed the questionnaire after the informative lecture&quot;Obesity is no accident&quot;, was to have a significant shift in the preferences to principles of healthy nutrition in many cases&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="109"> This was obvious, for example, when the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children crossed in the questionnaire also more often chicken or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet dishes. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Professionals claim – a stylist must be also a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article about how stylists, I had bitching a bit that was a bit too much stuff for the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Since I felt what still is not at all. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar about how that works &quot;on the square&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It will be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Depending on the test moves closer, more information and practical tasks us ahead. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the course Saturday and Sunday takes place each, he is still full. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we debated how it attracts a woman, who has not a perfectly proportioned figure with Director Alena (no one man takes part in the course). </seg>
<seg id="119"> And most of us are all the same. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Some have a short neck, the other a to boyish figure without proper curves, and still others are chubby. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is visually to disguise thing of stylists, wide shoulders, to extend the neck, or to conjure up the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got also tips on how you so cute and figurbetont attracts the type of a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist, without that it acts too provocatively. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really doesn&apos;t fit, should be made-to-measure tailor themselves at least a piece. </seg>
<seg id="124"> You will not regret it safely, because well fitting clothes is simply priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailored skirt you&apos;ll feel much better than in a out of the box, all the time high and slide, standing off in the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> In turn, boyish figures can allow to wear with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery, or gathering. </seg>
<seg id="127"> For this information and figure types, I am glad that a whole week I time, thoroughly through your head all me to let go. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And still, I am afraid that it is almost not to create given the on homework. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the participants got assigned to a celebrity namely, for which it matching outfits should - think from day wear and evening gown. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We should consider the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and whose character type. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I want to Miranda Kerr &quot;attract&quot; might know Victoria&apos;s secret from the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Inside I Exult, because for me personally, this is much better than to attract such as Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has increased probably to the hundred pounds in recent times (okay, that&apos;s a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The garments should we from magazines cut or search in the Internet, print and then graphically edit. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Is in the &quot;mood Board&quot;, as the entire result is called, our personal style and our relationship to be then graphic design to express. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is indeed very important to reflect also on the graphical side of stylings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist attracts models namely not only purely physically, but designed the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, such as the trend handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> It told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But that only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This means that a stylist must have a good overview. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The Saturday lecture filled with details of figure types was flavored three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> by the stylists Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and this should be capable of a stylist, to exploit this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a skilled stylist can do with a single article in a very different way to work. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word is variability. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So you can wear as usual for example a trench coat over jeans, so like a shirt or coat, you can wear it but also on the naked body, to attract sales shoes and wear it as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and just the whole look looks very different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> He stressed &quot;Plays it,&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most came but I located the following Council: &quot;First you must know perfectly the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Only then you may break it, Jakub said. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally is me why we need to bone up on all these dogmas, what can be combined with which clear and why, even if you will see often quite different in Modejournalen. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention fashion shows. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing options, as he eventually photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) it to style at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also, that the clothing in the photo in combination with further accessories sometimes look very different from, as in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> So, with all this, you can expect in the design of the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and style sometimes half of the success of make up, this was confirmed by us also Jan Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Since you need Madonna only once, to see a not just a brilliant singer, from the image and marketing have made a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic it is facing the services of stylists rather reserved. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Also notable people deem it frequently throwing out money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look it is secondary). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if somebody of us style, then we should expect that he or she imposes a different (smaller) size us most likely, than he or she needs in fact. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then you then just have to Google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes the corresponding celebrity have to again or taken off, needs, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday to the heart, not to believe that a stylist on fashion to focus and then &quot;to assemble the outfit&quot; need. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work he must communicate primarily with the people which he styles and he must be a clever psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> People estimate, without to delivering to and stand to his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;If any Manager ordered us to sift through their wardrobe and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can eliminate it not the whole closet and say - my God, this is so terrible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &quot;You need to find at least a few commendable things, which it recommends what you can wear&quot;, says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us also concretely what must include as a so-called &quot;space bag&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So a bag you to buttons at the waist and where to wear all required Proprietäten to himself. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Except such clear things, like scissors, dispenser to the hair removal or safety pins it contains also such utensils such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist for photographing of products such as handbags or hats helps out), special clips which back the clothes is killed, if it is too large (pins or other terminals are prohibited, so that the fabric is not broken) and of course sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So that we must not only listen to, but also practically can try something, we learned how to properly under sticks shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Also when shooting in the Studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let the outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Us o stuck and we stuck... </seg>
<seg id="173"> With scissors, you may not even touch the shoes for you Yes not damaged. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So, you must proceed really sent. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario delighted me by he praised my &quot;creation&quot; without any restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The mentioned skills is namely not just my strength. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this was only the fraction of what we at got to listen to the second weekend continuation rate. </seg>
<seg id="178"> One has become now clear to me - is the styling on a professional level to dedicate a no brainer. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V need for speed: &quot;The Run&quot; - the illegal race across America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> The originally carefree journey is through a series of completely avoidable, this error to the routine trip to the early shift. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Though, managed to fulfil the ambitions for the most part, but what good is that if obviously nobody had desire to do a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Even before he came on the counters, the new part with the subtitle &quot;The Run&quot; aroused high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Promised he but the already elderly game series &quot;need for speed&quot; again a piece in a new dimension to move and the playable demonstration examples, he seemed to actually be not only one of the many action racing games. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious as fail the fitted passages, in which the main protagonist of the car rises and continues walking. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as it is already used for NFS, much is different in the end than had been expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are certain – potentially pretty decent Arcade Racing, but overall the game is diminished by some unnecessary errors more or less a few years are present in this series. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So there are signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developer actually no errors more, but rather. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure starts very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> First one is introduced in the story, whose Hauptfigur Jack has certain problems of personal nature; the only solution seems to be an illegal race across America to take part in. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, so on the West Coast, one sits down at the steering wheel - whose mission is to be the first in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea includes a number of interesting items. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The entire route is divided in 10 stages and more than fifty individual race. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every race on the other line is held, and that the individual stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment take place. </seg>
<seg id="195"> One gets the impression that game would no moment again and again the same offer. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are still very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So nothing earth-shattering. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey through the desert, by autumnal landscape or high above snow-covered landscape gives visually very pleasant you a feeling. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Occasionally non-standard elements bring a little variety in the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert such as the, one is surprised by a desert storm which heavily restricts the view. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains in turn you have to watch hellish, it is buried by an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> By the way, the individual races are fitted quite well in a row. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Only a few, but they range. </seg>
<seg id="204"> A while attempting to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (basically a classic race), then one has time to catch up (Classic race against the stopwatch), then still a personal duel with a single counterparty expected one. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And to even the police intervene, which screw will up the whole thing one. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Passages, where Jack leaves the car are a novelty. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It involves rather certain interactive animations, in which Jack flees from anyone and where the player must help him by pressing the right button at the right moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> However, it is surprising that there are in the game of much less such passages than one would expect (actually probably only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> Ultimately this thing is more for the benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is promised to the elements which make the game interesting in the context of the above. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The driving model continues in the footsteps of the previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> In other words, seen from today&apos;s point of view, it rips off although no trees, on the other hand it could be said that it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Those looking for realistic simulations, must look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But the local driving model is also still quite an action-packed racing, although you could find better in the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then everything best is fine so far. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems only appear after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not quite OK </seg>
<seg id="218"> From a game of this type is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically before any impact with an object, any idea how the car behaves, then not everything is fine apparently. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Case in point: when you close overtaking or passing of oncoming cars &quot;it touches&quot; the other car in some places only slightly, but in the slings to get in another, almost identical situation and turns wild pirouettes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or just drives the cart to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks of the restart system makes that although nothing further, as it is always annoying. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The remaining images are so solved: If one has total loss or lands far away from the track, then the game throws one back at the last clue of the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Only - in every race there are only five remaining art. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If one has exhausted it, everything from scratch to go... </seg>
<seg id="225"> The remaining images are so rather something like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it leave you not should be preferred. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes helps but not even the restart, since nothing else helps to learn as the critical section of the head. </seg>
<seg id="227"> It is very uncomfortable that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> You must go through some curves for example in very specific ways, otherwise you pay not by. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere you meet at the appropriate place of &quot;civilian&quot; cars always in same configuration, no matter, whether as first or fifth, formerly of five seconds or a minute later comes. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This is annoying especially in situations when one sees that the counterparty a playing passes to two oncoming cars, but until you go there yourself, the cars are already in such a position, that one must they drive around or brakes. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it is no matter when there arrives, everything is so designed that there always densely is this situation in your face. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents have other advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> There are a few places where it is being over always in the same place by the same opponent in the whole game and again regardless of the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> This is the roughest on the conclusion of the game on the long bridge that it happens in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The counterparty must one here obviously to Devil come out to overtake. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And if it is then ever before, then he takes the view a course, so that there initially a few times in Equinovarus driving your car. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Clear - it wants to make the game simply thrilling and exciting but this intention is so clearly that they quickly vermiest the joy of playing one. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And that is a pity, because despite the simpler model of driving, the game is overall quite entertaining and at times so action loaded that we hardly know where the head is a. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And, in principle, no matter what the concept with fifty unique routes &quot;blame&quot; - is the arrangement of the race in a way that no boredom can arise, or something else entirely... </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is also change of cars during the race. </seg>
<seg id="241"> You should not overlooked the gas stations on the line, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough, that one just has. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports car are well suited to the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and Super exotic sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the winding in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Also the tasks mode (challenges) - so the race in the individual locations familiar from the history goes hand in hand with the mode of the game story. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Here, there are not only medals but also experience points for the own profile to win that is common for the tasks (challenges), and the story. </seg>
<seg id="246"> To get to the higher level of the driver, various objects need to be closed: starting from the car, and the backgrounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is at the same time connected to the online function AutoLog that compares with other players including the own results and also provides other collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the more obscure carvers is a situation in the last race of the history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here you go namely by car in an underground tunnel (all right), where long locking you in the dark on the tracks (all right). </seg>
<seg id="250"> Look at the speedometer digits between 150 a 200 km/h (all right), but then comes suddenly from behind a rapid and uncompromising driving a wreck. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editorial staff, we will argue probably long about whether that was a blackout of the Spielgestalter or whether the authors deem us as stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even more annoying is that when some exciting moments the refresh rate is slower and sometimes quite dramatically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This applies however, namely the accidents with larger number of involved, where a continuous FPS anyway does not help one. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The sound is so far OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In an effort to attract an as wide as possible scale rather young audience, was a soundtrack of a Lá &quot;of each something&quot;-but who buys himself such a game yet because the music? </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall impression of need for speed: the run? The feelings are rather mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game would diminished by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we had can claim with the shrug of the belief that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But as the game looks somehow unfinished. </seg>
<seg id="260"> For which a class treat, but you should prepared be, that these errors stand one with the power of airport lights in the eyes. </seg>

<seg id="276"> EU Ambassador Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation of Negativisten and Euro-sceptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &quot;The Lisbon Treaty brought tangible the balance among the different institutions from the lot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> &quot;I would not expect that such a tough war rages.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &quot;It will take five, six years until troubled waters smoothed itself and will have all become accustomed to their new role&quot;, began her talk at the Law Faculty of Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How she Verständlich and openly takes seriously the motto &quot;on Europe&quot;, showed already in the first part of her lecture in which it managed to describe that as lecturer of the Law Faculty of the Charles University would have can below them about the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relationships in a such manageable and understandable way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs Vicenová commended also the new permanent President of the European Council Herman van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &quot;Initially was loud, he is too unobtrusive - grey officials who was not up to such a role, but I have to say, it has all the breath devious how well he has taken the matter.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="284"> &quot;He is a man, which it completed will patiently listen to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and has above all a clear idea of how to proceed with the EU.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and security policy said they then as an answer to the question: who is this actually - the European Union? What number should I call? &quot;, as a major step to the unification and better readability of the EU countries, such as China or India.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to ban us our Ölmützer cheese </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs Vicenová devoted himself to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency two years ago, she called success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the Summit of Eastern Partnership organized. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the Government during the Presidency, she called big negative point that have severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech delegation in the EU has to do all hands full. </seg>
<seg id="292"> With the words of the Ambassador told it went to quite hectic not just the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis which has still not been overcome until today. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And since even the seven year budget of the EU must be approved, what makes much more complicated the matter precisely because of the current economic situation. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it is a sleek and economical budget which sectors of the economy get priority, which more countries and which less - promoted all of this is now on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The Ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: &quot;Verständlich over Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &quot;If I don&apos;t like something, then there are greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon, which nobody understands.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="297"> How do I actually know as citizens whether one thinks out really curved or round cucumbers and different sized bananas in Brussels, or whether in fact someone wants to ban the cheese us. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It would also like to used the floor of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe of two or different speeds in Vista </seg>
<seg id="300"> According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs in reputed to be more Eurosceptic are the negative than perceive the positive sides of the matter. </seg>
<seg id="301"> The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Many factors are responsible, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least, the weak support of the Czech side. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Besides the successful Czech presidency, she pointed out the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called v4. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &quot;Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak close, then thinks the Frenchman next to me:&quot;Hey, what&apos;s her since the heads together - this is your v4 again?&quot;and it makes a pretty sour face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="305"> Mrs Vicenové according to especially hard rules for the budget policy of Member States expect the EU in the future. </seg>
<seg id="306"> It looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much real as a &quot;European Federation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &quot;We have the euro-zone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="308"> &quot;We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of reinforced cooperation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &quot;For the first time, it was said that only the countries you want to work, who want it and those who do not want it to be quietly away.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &quot;There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong&quot;Europe of different speeds&quot;,&quot; expect woman Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this regard she acknowledged also the role the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle according to which all issues which affect the whole of the EU from all Member States must be discussed, and not only by the countries of the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> Wanted to you looking for a suitable word, that the strategy of IBM most accurately characterized, then this would be the word &quot;Longevity&quot; probably. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, known as a modern company, although already a century has elapsed since its inception. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Already their first chef - the visionary Thomas j. Watson sen laid the Foundation to this longevity. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he was the slogan that numerous global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a bit. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; was to a trademark, the life of the future giant should take place (and at the same time the title of the in-house magazine to publish began at IBM already in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of the corporate culture that is thoroughly prepared by Watsen. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &quot;For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle move to the future.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was successful because it has stayed true to its principles and was not afraid to change anything else round about also a whole century. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technologies to transform business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> &quot;We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years&quot;, said Samuel j. Palmisano, the current Director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson operation already in the 1930s social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid leave, insurance by the contractor plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and an ingenious system of remuneration for the best innovators and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Long-term relations of IBM are just as sophisticated with their customers. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was from the beginning, awesome in the talent - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM picked up any discrimination - and could choose accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the top of IBM alternated next year by a woman from Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Which is already 30 years at IBM, so far she took up the position of sales, marketing and strategy manager. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM makes adult&apos;s so-called online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No wonder - ideas there enough, almost half a million people is employed in the company. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Its unshakable position in the business the company guarantees a strong image and this towards the inside and to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &quot;The concept of an institution, as a mere technology company from the outset had IBM rather&quot;, Economist said the Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using of technologies&quot;, George colony added to by consulting firm Forrester research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself emphasised, is there a difference on the market to be only present or to shape him directly by this presence. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - in the States of their logos due to familial &quot;big blue&quot;, in a century has grown into one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting, and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> From all us technology companies, IBM has the most patents and already five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his most famous inventions such as ATMs, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code, or also the disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With approximately $220 billion market capitalization (market capitalization) IBM this year was the second-largest technology company (immediately after Apple), which it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996. </seg>
<seg id="342"> The view ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations met the taste of today&apos;s customers – unhappy were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service prodigy or the computer IBM PC Jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &quot;Business is based on the forward motion, so you must bind itself not emotionally to the past,&quot; said Samuel j. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and to leave them if they don&apos;t work, again. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> The profits from IBM services participate to a great extent, software and hardware to participate to each one-fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> It was still 1990 most represented hardware containing more than fifty prozentigem. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM sold theirs off little gain in assets valued at $15 billion, at the same time, however, it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In these investments, IBM will continue after 2008 as swept the modern financial crisis for the first time like a storm across the world. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Also IBM remained the legacy of his first Chief Thomas j. Watson, increased the amount of its investment in the middle of the great depression. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far, it seems that the company IBM without prejudice to survive today&apos;s crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of IBM shares rose like a rocket since 2008 by 120 percent and net income of the company grows kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The customers of IBM is: everything can change - only the values do not. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Also, it can be expected that this flexible giant masters the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM history: from the cheese cutter to space flights </seg>
<seg id="358"> Initially, the company IBM (international business machines) founded one hundred years ago in New York had a rather complicated name - computing Tabulating recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> She assumed the name of IBM until 1924 – originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The merger of four companies, whose history dating back to the eighties of the nineteenth century laid the Foundation for the later company IBM. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They had technologies such as for example the famous Stechkarte clocks to register the start and corresponding. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, which held until 1930 also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. </seg>
<seg id="363"> And it was Flint, who was the head of the rival firm Thomas j. Watson, so that this helped him in the direction of the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> This leader then even the founders of IBM in the shadows - on Watson&apos;s ideas was based until today the invincible culture and identity of the company. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM, began, as the name reveals, the production and the distribution of all possible machines for trading - sausage and cheese cutters up to cash registers. </seg>
<seg id="367"> He doubled their sales to nine million dollars in the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, and the company gradually expanded to all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was so indispensable to the company whole forty years sitting in the Executive Chair, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership, IBM began to develop of artificial intelligence to work and developed also the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 1960s, technicians and computer from IBM NASA helped to direct flights into space - the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of people to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with same computer architecture - the series of IBM System/360 in 1964. </seg>
<seg id="372"> A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of at the time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later, IBM sold its PC production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand however bought the Consul tante part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and entered the hereby fully in the business consulting services and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that pays off IBM in the past three years is the concept of &quot;Smarter Planet&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It is the intention to use technologies in a clever way in so far not even planned areas, also to improve the situation in the transport sector and in the city administration. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In the trade sector IBM introduced recently the platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot;, is designed to help dealers manage the commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="378"> Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - ever first country in Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today, IBM operates Czech Republic, including a strategic outsourcing Centre in Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Moved the Head Office for Central and Eastern Europe in Prague and also a top team of world-class, located here that deals with the technology of voice recognition. </seg>

<seg id="404"> The worst female Untugenden: What is&apos;s with you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> If one asks the men to to call some typical female Untugenden, then they shake some invariably prompt from the sleeve. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Dear women, recognize you are in the following lines, where we review a few were let through again, that the blood in the veins undulate allow men? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Shopping addiction </seg>
<seg id="408"> Accuses her husband them to be addicted to shopping? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Need to buy yourself a week at least a Hader? </seg>
<seg id="410"> Go like shopping and it may be just a bit more action? </seg>
<seg id="411"> It is in your case probably really a weakness. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women are at least aware and reasonably try their shopping desire under control to keep. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But hand on heart, which woman holding out there already, looking to stroll after a well-fitting outerwear only by a clothing store and not just to try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Even when shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is pure hell often. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Consider how often they said her husband doch mal - stay times rather out there... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Constant dissatisfaction </seg>
<seg id="417"> &quot;I&apos;m not too thick?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &apos;I would have to diminish at least five kilo, should I start to jog or to make gymnastics?&apos; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &quot;You at all like I?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> It is found that somehow known them? </seg>

<seg id="422"> Then you probably also belong to the women who are thorough owned them, what they look like. </seg>
<seg id="423"> That long does not mean that you go to can, but many men are allergic react if their wife constantly whines about her appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always more. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and cleanliness in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is a fight against windmills. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Window cleaning, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice in the week. </seg>
<seg id="428"> Rant with her partner, because he once again trampling with dirty shoes on the clean floor tiles, you scold the children because the just frayed sink is dirty again, and the glass door to the living room Cabinet again has fingerprints, where polishing but makes so much effort? </seg>
<seg id="429"> Should suffer this kind of &quot;Deviance&quot;, then you should know that you may exaggerate nothing and that order and cleanliness in family life in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="430"> This excessive purity alternatively can harm ultimately also the mutual relations and above all tranquility in the family. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Jive </seg>
<seg id="432"> &quot;Dirty collarless come in the laundry basket.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="433"> &quot;Do you attract really tomorrow again the old socks?&quot; </seg>

<seg id="437"> If the men knew this women needed may be not so much to gripe. </seg>
<seg id="438"> Gossip </seg>
<seg id="439"> Some women gossip and gossip like, as is getuschelt behind the back or even slander or it forges alliances. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Women are now focused on relationships, therefore it heck through such issues like for example - who, where, who, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip on Commons. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Hand on heart - that is inherent to all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> This is however not to be confused with Klatschtanten of grossest caliber, where nothing and no one is holy, which probably despise anyone in their environment, and which pose a significant risk for women collectives. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jagr and Voracek helped Philadelphia with their assistances to victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The NHL right winger Jaromir Jagr had the Monday game of the National Hockey League with two assistantships large proportion of 5: 3-victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and this is again productive Czech players in the NHL. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Beneficiaries of the overview of neununddreißigjährigen ice hockey star was both Claude Giroux, which added still an Assistant and was proclaimed to be the best player of the match. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Even Jagr&apos;s teammates Jakub Voracek had two assistantships in the same game. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr claimed after the game journalists, he did Giroux a great evening prophesied. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &quot;Before the match I tells him that today a Hattrick succeeds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> &quot;I had that somehow the feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &quot;Every now and then such a feeling comes over one&quot;, said Jagr, whose action Giroux at the first shot the flyers scored one goal. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A bit later, also the second hit &quot;a Czech track&quot; had. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek won the puck behind the hurricanes and presented him to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles. </seg>
<seg id="454"> One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third belonged to the flyers again. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Concrete Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In collaboration with Jagr, he scored his third goal, after Wayne Simmonds drew shot to the fourth gate. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &quot;I love it, to play with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &quot;I will not say that he is the best player in the League, but certainly he is three among the best,&quot; Jagr paid tribute to its Center. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &quot;I would not invaded in life, that I play at the end of my career with such a hockey player together, like with him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &quot;Glad huge.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &quot;I cut with my game on I.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &quot;All those years in the National Hockey League, my teammates set their game on me and now the Pike turns around,&quot; Jagr smiled. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina made game still on a play - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who came from a penalty shot, it came up on a goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt read prevented but any further complication, in which he was successful in power play two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &quot;Excellent Pronger acted in our zone.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &quot;He had the puck, I took up ride and (read) moved to more distant post.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &quot;I tried to meet him and am glad that it worked,&quot; Voracek described the last goal of the match from his point of view. </seg>
<seg id="468"> By this victory, Philadelphia sat down at the top of the Eastern Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech Defender Montreal Jaroslav Špaček, injured in a game against Buffalo, and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Candiens lost along with their experienced Beck also their leadership a unverloren in penalty shooting 2: 3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of penalty shots. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points, high disease-related failure on the defensive ached probably the coach of the home team - they played the game with only five does to an end. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &quot;That&apos;s bad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &quot;We played only with a single experienced player to end the encounter, the rest were young players.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &quot;But because nothing can make, which we need to be ready,&quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &quot;With each change a wave after the other and we had nothing to counter the.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;We could make the game easier and the puck from our third take out need to.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> &quot;Here there was still&quot;, said p. k. Subban, one of the defensive player. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec repelled thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to a 5-2-in victory over Winnipeg. </seg>
<seg id="480"> At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats hereby, five different shooters had a share. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of travel prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 there were ČSSR only five authorized State agencies in the former: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies sold mainly only travel in the Socialist bloc countries, were at that time only select in the West. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And so travelled Czech tourists on the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - East Germany), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and after Hungary at the Lake Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to the former Yugoslavia, then, Yugoslavia set a pro-Western course and therefore trips were limited to the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of those Socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechs), to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen of CZECHOSLOVAKIA wanted travel for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union then he needed to a so-called letter of invitation, otherwise individuals were not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Already at that time, the travel agencies offered also travel to the West, then had to you but huge snakes in buying take stay also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, or have at least &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> So the thing had not been still long. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called foreign exchange approval - the condition for a departure to the West - has been granted only &quot;politically reliable&quot; people – the others were allowed to travel do not. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was namely not freely exchangeable currency, without foreign currency commitment it would have been impossible, to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a journey to the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Afar most Czechs spent therefore their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs countless pavilions and cottages bought - a habit that continues to this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the Velvet Revolution of 1989 on the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While until 1989, a holiday in East Germany or in Bulgaria were the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of around the world last year. </seg>
<seg id="495"> An enormous paradox, there is today no longer aware, is the fact that you ever not could travel Croatia in the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Right from the beginning of 90&apos;s of the last century the foreign exchange requirement in the neighbouring West European countries was lifted, causing a massive wave of short visits to Vienna, in particular Austria and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechs could have simply not enough long time of their travels to the West, everyone wanted to have been at least a couple of days there. </seg>
<seg id="498"> So, the Czech tourists when travelling to Paris slept in a tent in the Park, because who would have had at that time already the money for a stay in the hotel or in a boarding house. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of travelling by Czechs was a trunk packed full with canned food, beer and summer sausage, etc. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was the introduction of freely exchangeable CZK - after decades of our tourists could buy finally free the Western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and thereby also the average salaries increased to, which in 1997 resulted in a more important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel after 1997, the travel agencies began regularly by Charter flights to prepare journeys, which incredibly prices plunged the airline travel thanks to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past. </seg>
<seg id="503"> The Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment transactions with all advanced countries of the world, had the late of 1990s which made the trip even easier. </seg>
<seg id="504"> A further interesting moment in the history of &quot;post Velvet&quot; travel occurred in 2000, when thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - was placed under Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since then every year direct Charter aircraft fly with Czech passengers to distant sunny countries; This year, it flies to 12 exotic destinations directly from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="506"> To the 100 thousand. Czech travel annually to exotic countries! </seg>
<seg id="507"> A further significant moment in the era that featured our &quot;post-revolutionary&quot; development, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the visa requirements for Czech tourists picked up the United States, which our country definitely filed a under the advanced countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history it issued more than 15 thousand. CZK per head for a single stay including the costs at the resort. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The annual general meeting is to find a new Chairman – again threatens a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months of Czech football has no Chairman and thereby threatens that Ivan Hašek successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even will be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Until today are according it the electoral code should be dialed: still no agreement. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And without this, at all, no vote on the three potential successors is possible. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June, Hašek retired from his position, where he called on his colleagues at the departure to had to agree and to find a strong personality that could guide the football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only - in the era after Hasek the old quarrels between the two chambers of the Federation broke out again, which themselves cannot agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was clearly on 16 September, when the new Chairman should be selected. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the annual general meeting had come completely free in the Volkshaus in the Prague quarter Smichov, because negotiation led to no result, and was not only to the election itself. </seg>
<seg id="519"> One could indeed not even about agree, who is actually entitled to vote at the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power of attorney. </seg>
<seg id="520"> On this single point, it reached at least some agreement, which contributed also the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, whose opinion a representation on a proxy basis is not permissible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The disputes over the electoral code take to still. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The Executive Committee also brought no more clarity on the matter at its meetings – regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary - in nothing else more on the agenda is the principle at all. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Although the views on the choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: what should we do round in the 3rd, to avoid a stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;The point of contention concerns the question of whether one should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a completely different model needs to be found,&quot; Dušan Svoboda, said that one of the three Deputy Chairmen of FAČR representing the professional football management. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to its registered model, those candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the Chamber for the Perben WINS in the third round. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that WINS those candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both houses. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side in turn is on the condition that the winner of this percentage counting receives at least two-thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense whatsoever, this mode would make the entire dual-Chamber concept into question,&quot; Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, that it would be best not to turn to the electoral code, but to choose according to valid Statute. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if emerging that the statutory electoral code of all candidates will most probably Pelta contrary to. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;My wish is, that as far as possible is selected according to the articles of Association.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;So that no unreasonable spare variants are thought of as at the last annual general meeting&quot;, explained the owner (of football) Victoria Plzeň, who stood for the first time and in his opinions, especially Pelta to delimited himself. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains but optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In his opinion the new Chairman will be in Nymburk known and he believes that the candidate in the future will also constructively work together. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;The possible qualification of the national team for the euro today would help ensure calm the minds.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;If the football only riding on the euphoric wave, then also the willingness to cooperate is greater,&quot; says the official from Jablonec, which brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this professional, as well as regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is as restrained. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts&quot;to turn their way the rules for his own purposes&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;Therefore, a renewed blockage at the annual general meeting is not excluded.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;However, I hope that the common sense WINS eventually&quot;, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - plenty of time to agreement all sides will remain no longer. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations should play is supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generality of football will be completely up to the qualifier at all. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The Charter plane which, among other things, Dalibor-Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start due to a technical malfunction in the morning in Prague and so it sought feverishly for a replacement version, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee yet on the venue of the barrage Hinspiels. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Finally the meeting at ministerial level is crucial then surely, which supposedly is to occur on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobeš, which would have been Minister for education, youth and physical training like an agreement moves the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands in the country. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is much at stake: State benefits, the trust value of Czech football, and also the upcoming AGM of ČSTV, that is to have the new direction the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes into battle to the position of Chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates </seg>
<seg id="549"> When Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football players before the extraordinary general meeting could have made out a strong candidate, which would have fulfilled all of his wishes on the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would have admitted is at all not on the battle for this leading position. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If there were a good candidate, then I would for him fight and forego the choice.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation, was unable to find a such adepts&quot;, Paclík, CTK said. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for Paclík, to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is it so to avoid that which reaches supposed favorites of choice, Pelta, to the top of FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stresses that he only one year to exercise the function of the Chairman intends in the event of his victory so until 2013, up to the date of the annual general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of the Chairman he would have liked learn a top-manager, which is not too much in the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;With some eligible people I&apos;ve spoken personally.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;Hard to believe that me some said they wanted to identify currently not with Czech football.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Such views would have gladly changed&quot;, he stated. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs the connection of Pelta&apos;s with the Chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Roman jumpers, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates votes at general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík, it is unacceptable that Pelta had held the position of Chairman for this reason. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;In his victory would the State of today&apos;s single konserviert and Czech football it not go ahead at all.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;The support of jumpers, one would get excellent businessman, football double bad&quot;, stressed Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Hereby he plays on also that Pelta&apos;s name fell some time ago in connection with telephone taps to determine in a Korruptionsaffaire, but punishment emerged from the Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I a victory of Pelta don&apos;t know (Czech) which prestige which&quot; &quot;Football should introduce.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA&quot; řekl Paclík said his &quot;he will sell the Pilsner Football Club earlier saying, when will Pelta of Chairman&quot;, but already somewhat relaxed looks. </seg>
<seg id="565"> Should Paclík in the Thursday election win, he could imagine but quite a future cooperation with Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just think an another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík had supported before the general meeting in October ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;He (Pelta) would be the first I would go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;He has great ability&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;I could imagine him well as head of the national team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But I don&apos;t think that he is able to lead the Association as a Manager.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I stick my nose but not in matters of which I don&apos;t understand anything&quot;, said Paclík, which thus had caused September stir, that he was behind the removal of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the top, replacing the Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík even claims that he feels has grown the role of Verbandsvorsitzenden. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And refers it to his abilities in the direction of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, which with its support in May the first victory in the League celebrated. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain culture of this.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeals commissions, what degenerate until in sickening situations&quot;, noted Paclík who makes no secret of his antipathy for example opposite the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of its priorities, he would see to the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which he lobbyieren would the political leaders for this, that more money from the lottery tax in the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;That is one of the crucial things the new President should address&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, then they must say but also quite and clearly where the money is going,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> His connection to the Pilsen Club looks at also Paclík not as a handicap, even though he himself stressed the Chairman of FAČR must be &quot;nonpartisan&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;This is not exactly ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;It but also doesn&apos;t make much sense, Club hypocritically on a third party to transfer my shares in the Pilsner to return after one and a half years my opinion&quot;, Paclík made it clear. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new rules of FAČR, which will exclude a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the annual general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman of the Board, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised he will strongly become in case his choice for this, that the FAČR gets new statutes exclude disputes over the election rules from the outset in the future. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk and believes the election will defuse safely on a possible success in the Czech selection. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta promised already before the unrealised election in September, he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided only at the last minute, to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two month pause liked help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &quot;People at all levels focus on the football, they are impatient and expect therefore that the Chairman is known on Thursday.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &quot;He feels that it is high time, that the Association is led by someone, says the man who Club is connected above all with the Jablonec, but also many years at Sparta, and the Executive Committee acted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="590"> Also, he thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that the euphoria is responsible for today&apos;s problems with the election, who ruled at the time of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &quot;Unfortunately statutes were approved at the annual general meeting in June, which were not so perfect, as all had accepted it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="593"> &quot;If they would have allowed different interpretations, we would have had already a Chairman from September&quot;, said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> He used just the revision of the main document of the civic association as Attractants for the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &quot;Should I become President, then I suppose this personally to me and am ready to bear responsibility if it doesn&apos;t work out personally.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &quot;This is a fundamental thing, without which it can not be,&quot; said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition, he is not trying to differentiate itself compared to his counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="598"> He had earlier announced he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first Deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> He no longer attacked also Tomáš Paclík, who in turn had no dry thread on Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;In football, he moves over a year and can already point to some success.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks were putting down however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &quot;That is also why many of his real character doubt now&quot;, Pelta addressed his rival who probably remains true to his Proklamierungen, he expressed in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In his opinion his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football of the lowest leagues up to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the flagship of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &quot;I would try also to end all affairs - from the causa Bohemians, up towards to the halls to of the corruption scandal last year.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &quot;Equal then I would throw me on negotiations with the private and public sectors, to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football&quot;, the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate CTK said two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would mean no personal cleansing. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &quot;I would have to make me once familiar with the job content of all employees,&quot; he said where due to the long anarchy understandably nervousness prevails in the direction of Strahov. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the UN time-catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming annual general meeting, he believes that the delegates go not in vain on Thursday to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &quot;When really, the only contentious point should be how to choose in the third round, then we come across it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;The football needs credibility and he recovers only, if he finally has a new leader,&quot; remains optimistic before the possibly decisive day of his official career Pelta two days. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the FAČR below it starts to work hard </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the existing Deputy Chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, at the annual general meeting should be chosen on Thursday as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, this would despite the mood said many people in the Association. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, namely, that you begin to work hard in the event of his election. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce the system changes and blaming the members of the Executive Committee for individual football areas. </seg>
<seg id="616"> In addition, he promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money in football, and otherwise continue working the previous Chairman Ivan Hašek has begun. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &quot;As President I would like to dedicate me football as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, about the national team, professional football, up to performance football for youth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &quot;So I will not say that I want to do everything alone&quot;, Rajchl said in a talk for CTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &quot;I am a team player and would like to distribute therefore the responsibilities the Executive Committee so that each Member dedicates a certain area.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> &quot;And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in each segment with street steps of progress.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> &quot;In many would not exactly delighted because she, even now really hard to work would have to start instead of criticizing only the work of others,&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered, to no longer be a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &quot;I is known that I work 20 hours a day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &quot;But I need to know that it makes sense and that people behind me are not constantly throw me stick between your legs and challenge every step I make,&quot; he said why he had hesitated as an explanation. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &quot;Many people told me but that I not should give up, because otherwise, others would do it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &quot;That&apos;s confidence that we must not lose,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Allegedly motivated him also, to continue the work he started on Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;In two years, we have dealt with a great piece of work and I want to not just throw away that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Processes were launched, will probably only be implemented in a few years and I would hate to see that she stop someone&quot;, he said, and hereby expresses his concerns to, that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return themselves to the days before Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &quot;I believe in systematic approach and that is something that does not bring Mirek Pelta.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &quot;Especially people who would make football so that he would be only for chosen as stand behind him.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> &quot;One can not accuse probably a lot me, that I would be biased.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &quot;I try, to be objective.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &quot;I want football for all, and not only the elect because it then goes all,&quot; noted Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> It contradicts also the assertion that he is only a Chairman of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &quot;Even if some people the opposite claim I really intend to do the best for Moravia.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &quot;For example, it is time to consider whether you should divide the League not in a Czech and Moravian part, whose Gewinner then rose to the first division.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &quot;Then it could not happen, that today only three Moravian clubs in the League play, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia&quot;, says Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because now the boss of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the function of the Chairman, Rajchl not dares to assess his chances that he will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &quot;I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to its Deputy President and now recognizes that measurable results behind me are,&quot; noted Rajchl who sees the saving of umpteen million crowns to unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations over the lottery law as his success. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand he is holding it that the Association not at a single strand draws in part. </seg>
<seg id="643"> While he of Pelta says &quot;he was initially disqualified new confidence to help Czech football,&quot; he keeps the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who have to offer something really to football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &quot;No one can be in question, he has done excellent work in just one year in Plzen.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &quot;Should he be elected, then he would continue probably things, initiated by Ivan Hašek and he would obviously not basically change the staffing in the commissions.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> &quot;He would want to turn to the things not to abdicate&quot;, Rajchl says about his rival. </seg>

<seg id="648"> Jump into the blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> By Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Wading pool in UFO ornamental pools in Budapest: who travels through Europe, can be blue wonder experience - and rest tired legs in bubble baths after a city tour or a walk. </seg>
<seg id="651"> A book shows where wellness in the water is at its most beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When IRIS went Meder in the past one and a half years on a research tour, one could not lacking in their baggage: her bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Backwards lying on the water, looked she highly artistically designed domes, she swam marble putti, waiting on the pool edge to them, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau schwimmhallen. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Liked her a bath, she recorded at once it in your notebook - along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and presents them in her book &quot;Bathing&quot; published just now: people schwimmhallen in Munich, historical palaces of bathing in the Black Forest, &quot;hardcore concrete buildings&quot; in the Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> She led their &quot;journey to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe&quot; through 13 countries: apart from Germany, Austria and the Switzerland, she attended places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each is a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> The 46-jährige is a real bathroom culture enthusiasts. </seg>
<seg id="658"> With sport, she had not much to the hat, says Meder - only in the water, that was different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Annoying only listen that swimming fans must resign themselves with blue tiles and stench of chlorine, while joggers inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or happy birds in the Park can. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &quot;I asked myself one day why swimming pools must be always so ugly&quot;, which says living Meder in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &quot;So I began to collect beautiful baths.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> Water surface doubled architecture </seg>
<seg id="663"> So Meder was therefore as large, because all the senses are served splash in the pool and sauna essential oils - the Wellnessfaktor in bathrooms. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And if the builders have made effort, a true feast for the eyes can be swimming pools: &quot;Instead of a floor, it has a surface of the water in bathrooms.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &quot;You is transparent on the one hand, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> Everything doubled optical: high arches, colorful tiles, stepping stones. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The small-format illustrated book &quot;Bathing&quot; provides information about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - makes but mostly feel like a dip in the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> The pool collector discovered remarkable specimens Meder during their research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> In addition to sumptuous spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing waters in a cosy cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a thermal spa, whose Becken are filled with alkali-containing water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> Offer spectacular views, however, many heated outdoor pools in the Switzerland and Austria: while you have the entire city in the eye of the Zurich roof swimming pool, you can look in the outdoor swimming pool in a bath in St. Anton at the Arlberg snow-covered - and: in the steam room, there is a window from which you can watch the bustle on the ski slopes. </seg>
<seg id="671"> The perhaps most unusual pool design expected bathers in Längenfeld: the Ötz Valley Aqua dome looks like a UFO gelandetes just in the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> From three shells open to the top, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötz Valley in the Sky Tower. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> Not in any swimming pool, the smell of chlorine in the nose rose the pool collector Meder. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many thermal baths smell after sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békéscsaba stinks to be so strong it after fuel oil, it is hardly believed landed in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the alkali hydrogen carbonate containing healing water that is almost black and the Schlick one sticks to the skin when you slip into the basin - a wellness experience of a special kind. </seg>
<seg id="677"> In one place, Iris Meder in their search was also disappointed after beautiful swimming spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bad Luhatschowitz, she found before an area blocked off. </seg>
<seg id="678"> The bathroom designed in 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> As media took a look through the weathered Windows of red, white and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how grown weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Maturity counteracted has one, however, in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais thermal in bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> This bath has three stages of construction already behind him; Discover can be not only neo-Romanesque elements that originate from times of its construction in 1844, but also as a Moorish Hall in Alhambra style that was added around 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since the careful modernisation of 1995 the favorite pool of the pool expert IRIS Meder - and this is the Palais thermal not only because she originally come from the black forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &quot;It&apos;s an achievement, to merge different styles to one so great,&quot; says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> When such a Palace, the dive in the swimming pool is apparently just a minor matter. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agri speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> Deutsche Bank can shed light on raw material business </seg>
<seg id="687"> By Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Gives their business with agricultural commodities on Deutsche Bank? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world&apos;s poor. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the Chairman of the group will then draw consequences. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg- </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the Germans, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it according to a study not acceptable, that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn speculate. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two-thirds of respondents want even that Deutsche Bank and other credit from this business get off, because it exacerbates the problems of the world&apos;s poorest people. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report that the Foodwatch presented in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges driving the prices up - and the banks therefore bear a complicity in the global problem of hunger. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign of consumer protection aimed specifically against Deutsche Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally, commodity bets were it intended to protect merchants against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But now, most experts are agreed that the gambler decoupled of supply and demand, and at the expense of the poorest profits make. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business is &quot;worth to use the good name of Deutsche Bank&quot; it. </seg>
<seg id="701"> After information from SPIEGEL ONLINE is an international working group currently reviewing the accusations from the Foodwatch report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> The test to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - including recommendation, how so that should be handled. </seg>
<seg id="703"> End of January the head of the Bank wants to tell then what conclusions she draws. </seg>
<seg id="704"> At the end, a reduction of the commodity business could stand, or even a complete departure. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackermann tinkering with his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: &quot;Betting on rising prices of food shows very dramatically how reckless banks today damage the public good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackermann stand as top Bank lobbyist now especially in the obligation. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &quot;Deutsche Bank must delete all attachments from their portfolio, in which money is used for betting on food prices&quot;, said bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &quot;Regardless whether it is Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or to the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Chairman of the group a few months would like to give a perfect picture before his his departure from Office. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chairman of the Board other than planned not to the Supervisory Board will change. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a shift away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And to possible losses it needs hardly to care - so that his successor would have eventually to do. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Every second would cancel raw material plants </seg>
<seg id="715"> Foodwatch strives to keep up the pressure on the Manager. </seg>
<seg id="716"> So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="717"> Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 has surveyed people on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers equipment, bet where the food prices. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such dealings: every second would cancel all systems according to the survey, where money in the commodity speculation. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 Percent would advise against friends from one such Bank, 49 percent indicated that to think about, to terminate your account, and to switch to another institution. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21 House in Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The Pavilion drawn to </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A history of architecture with UPS, downs and happy ending: Of Brussels in 1958 of the Austrian Expo Pavilion won prices, became the Museum in Vienna, stood empty and degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="725"> He is now reopened as an exhibition venue. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If modern post-war architecture, carried by clear forms, glass halls, courageous turns and new building materials, that are typical for the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels world fair is a true and famous example of 1958. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzers Pavilion got at that time the Grand Prix d&apos;Architecture for its slightly and floating steel-glass construction. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The building is still a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He made known the architect so that the built Austrian Pavilion at the next world&apos;s fair. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus Bowl-like outhouse in Munich, he became famous in 1973 finally internationally. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His Pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition had after the World Exposition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station erected, converted and opened in 1962 is a Museum of the 20th century - it was called the &quot;1920&apos;s House&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Suitable but was neither spatially and technically as a Museum - no walls hang the art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless, it was used as long until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new House. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001, the building stood empty and came down more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the Pavilion, he is now called &quot;21 House&quot; and is used in the future as a Museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Dienstagabend, the Belvedere Museum, to which belongs the House, opened the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way there. </seg>
<seg id="737"> By Agnes Husslein-Arco has the new beginning, was the 2007 new Director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, Ph.d. by art historian with considerable career and others in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby&apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum, and a founding Director of the Museum of modern art was the tag Salzburg, strongly politicians and heritage protectors, she procured public funding and private sponsorships, and set the use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except for contemporary art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation should be issued, there should be a cafe and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built to do so. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> Krischanitz was then the ideal person for the implementation. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had Joseph Olbrich secession in Vienna sensitively converted and extended, and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at Vienna University of technology and the Pavilion for him was a &quot;hugely important place&quot; where he &quot;almost every weekend&quot; had looked at the exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building lost at his transfer to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness. </seg>
<seg id="744"> At the current change, there were far bigger problems: the building was &quot;an energy spin&quot;, says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used glass-reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Bridges steel beams are strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets were renovated. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two underground floors took place for the new use, a sunken light trench between home and street ensures the exposure, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original exterior doors have remained, the House is painted in the old reddish rust colour. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is even still exactly as he was earlier. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &quot;Often a material had to be found that is good and is cheap and liked also the historic preservation Office&quot;, says Krischanitz, and points to a bumpy floor in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It had been difficult with the Pavilion &quot;which came therefore from Brussels&quot; Krischanitz recently said, a typical &quot;drop in-the-city history&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such an architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and wants nevertheless &quot;a real consciousness awaken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, however, the 21 House not in the wrong place, is because it has occurred a urban fluke: to the Swiss garden around is just the newly planned &quot;station hotel&quot;, with Office and residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And an other godsend is perhaps still enter: 21 House could get amplification of an another Krischanitz build, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin, and as we hear, she negotiated with the city a neighbourly site in the Swiss Garden. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Train planning winter anti-crisis package worth millions </seg>
<seg id="758"> The railway has studied a crises plan, which is intended to prevent cancellations in winter. </seg>
<seg id="759"> The number of employees is to be doubled. </seg>
<seg id="760"> This costs millions. </seg>
<seg id="761"> In the fight against winter-related cancellations and delays Deutsche Bahn also emits a newspaper report that this year about 70 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The &quot;image&quot; newspaper reported advance, citing an internal crisis plan 2015 investments of a total of approximately 300 million euros are planned. </seg>
<seg id="763"> A better availability should achieve of vehicles and rail network in extreme downpours. </seg>
<seg id="764"> It is planned to include a doubling of internal and external staff for the removal of snow on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 persons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The objective is to free platforms up to the start of the operation and 90 per cent of the essential points within four to five hours of snow and ice. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Two months ago Bahn CEO Ruediger Grube had warned after a meeting of top Government and industry cancellations and delays in this winter. </seg>
<seg id="767"> Last winter, the railway passenger services had significant problems, as lacking her among other things in difficult weather conditions in reserves. </seg>
<seg id="768"> So, many new regional trains wait for years for authorisation by the federal railway Office. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The train makes to create significantly more likely in the Workshop examine axes of ICE trains must allow, after an ICE Cologne main railway station had a Achsenbruch also for years. </seg>

<seg id="772"> New affliction from the United States comes after the turmoil to boss Josef Ackermann: Die Deutsche Bank there a fine of millions pay. </seg>
<seg id="773"> As if the problems were not enough at home for Deutsche Bank, now his past in the United States catches up with the industry giants: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="774"> It involves the sale of mortgage securities. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Finanzmarktregulierer NCUA accuses a number of big banks, having led the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they have played down the risks. </seg>
<seg id="776"> Such papers lost during the financial crisis, strong value and tore the banks with in depth. </seg>
<seg id="777"> &quot;We are pleased that we could resolve the issue, without having had to move the parties before the Court,&quot; a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The Bank admitted no fault with the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This also applies to the Citigroup committed to pay $ 20.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed concessions the two sounding. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. credit unions and jumps for bankruptcies, to protect the customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="782"> The NCUA is trying to get replaced the losses of billions. </seg>
<seg id="783"> The now closed comparisons are the first of its kind. </seg>
<seg id="784"> Regulators had other big banks made above and in summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The questionable mortgage securities is known as mortgage-backed securities. </seg>
<seg id="786"> Home loans are based on these. </seg>
<seg id="787"> When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this a wide range of financial firms was undoing. </seg>
<seg id="788"> In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers tipped to. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Even though the events some years back, so a sharp wind blows forward currently in the United States the banks. </seg>
<seg id="790"> Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits, to receive compensation or to penalize misconduct. </seg>
<seg id="791"> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has raised the largest wave of litigation. </seg>
<seg id="792"> She accuses 18 large international banks to have disadvantaged the two State U.S. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage transactions with a volume of around 200 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="793"> Deutsche Bank also is facing a complaint of FHFA, we are talking to several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="794"> The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt for &quot;substantial losses&quot; are just, without however mentioning an exact amount. </seg>
<seg id="795"> Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and said to want to defend themselves. </seg>

<seg id="799"> So far, the large American Investor Warren Buffett had always declared not in it and computer companies to invest, because the long-term development of the companies poorly forecast let. </seg>
<seg id="800"> Now have however read the annual reports from IBM he changed his mind about investment in the industry. </seg>
<seg id="801"> He did need to understand much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and obtain computer systems for other companies IT departments. </seg>
<seg id="802"> An investment by Warren Buffett is considered accolade in the financial world. </seg>
<seg id="803"> As a result IT veteran IBM may call themselves now &quot;Sir IBM&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="807"> He praised the management which had ensured even in the economic crisis still decent profits. </seg>
<seg id="808"> &quot;You have done a great job,&quot; said Buffett&apos;s strategy. </seg>

<seg id="817"> Therefore, he is a cult figure for countless investors around the world. </seg>
<seg id="818"> His almost unmistakable sense of the money-making has earned him the nickname of &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the announcement of the Buffett investment, Aktiengesellschaft, the IBM stock rose one percent. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &quot;Big blue&quot;, as IBM is also called, is a total of more than $220 billion worth on the stock exchange and thus along with Apple and Microsoft is among the most valuable technology company in the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> At Microsoft, Buffett said he would not go but. </seg>

<seg id="824"> After the detection of the &quot;Zwickauer cell&quot; doubt Turkish media at the German rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> A newspaper even mentions a &quot;bloody ideology&quot;, which again live. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight Turkish gang members and a Greek small businesses in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background. </seg>
<seg id="827"> This message is responded to in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Because for many German Turks long dead geglaubtes the ghost returns thus: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable power with right-extremist background against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> That there are xenophobia in Germany, was still never in question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The right extremist network face-up but reveals proportions, whose Dimension is already impossible to predict. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &quot;The bloody ideology lives on again?&quot; headlined the Internet Edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot;, however, stressed that one of the perpetrators was an informer of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities in the right-wing radical swamp might be involved. </seg>

<seg id="835"> In cheerful colours, the balance was staged as a story of success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Since the reporting of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: &quot;Germany&apos;s gift to the 50th&quot; reads the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, which expounds the backgrounds of serial of murders. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Also the Germany Edition of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; can not resist, making this Association. </seg>

<seg id="841"> Why it not much more was invaded the German authorities, to search for suspects in extremist circles the authors wonder. </seg>

<seg id="845"> What does it mean if the inner peace in Germany in danger is, demonstrated the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory of German and Turkish. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks, however, sharpened the we feeling on the Turkish side. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Do not repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the Turkish press at that time especially the failure of German policy was criticized after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> He sent a condolences to the President of the Turkish Republic, was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel but at the funeral service in Cologne after the arson attack of Solingen - Kinkel listed at that time in his speech, how many charges were the local Turks. </seg>
<seg id="852"> So, as the value of a person calculate according to the amount of his taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current Turkish media coverage shows, once again, the mistrust of many Deutschtürken in the local rule of law since then is how deep. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of an extensive clarification and reassessment of right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The scandals the Zürisee Bank </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most adventurous Bank of Europe sits not in Italy or France, but in the Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slithers from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now, a German is to set it. </seg>
<seg id="859"> So it had not thought themselves safe Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was in July become known, that he join a new job almost as spectacular 2013 would: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss banking giant UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised the Switzerland whether her beauty and the UBS whether their newfound solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;UBS has managed the turnaround&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September it became clear that everything would be quite different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all the Bank&apos;s security systems and approximately 1.7 billion euros of audited. </seg>
<seg id="866"> UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, a banker marxloh not only in the Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the Board of Directors of UBS considered since then also defeated - and all ask: when will at last Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already, it was announced that Weber must advise the Bank of February 2012 to. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And he takes over the Presidency of the Board of Directors already in may - not only in the year 2013, the Bank announced on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber, this is hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Instead, it is not a banker, Professor of Economics and central bankers and would have certainly needed a training period. </seg>
<seg id="872"> In one fell swoop he then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a Bank, which just once again proved that long ago &quot;largest scandal Bank of Europe&quot; deserves the title. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest asset manager in the world — and on the other hand slides for years by a scandal in the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems is saving the once-proud Swiss Bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It all began in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager had combines them with ambitious goals: you wanted to be a big number also in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So managed the UBS 2007 with $1.6 trillion customer vermögender more money than any other Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And on the other hand it was advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world&apos;s largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This made impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and later longtime Professor of banking in Zurich told Hans Geiger: &quot;My students I found out UBS then always as an example of a good Bank.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;From today&apos;s perspective, you ask yourself: how could I be wrong just so?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He erred tremendously. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it was for the first time revealed that something went wrong part in UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> Middle of the year Chief Executive Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which was until then considered high intellectuals and equally brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later you knew why he had gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment division of the Bank had the audited themselves with subprime papers and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital increase amounting to no less than 13 billion Swiss francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> It found they actually investors however which, would have wrinkled on the many people until shortly before even the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so secret that it not even learned his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was just the first hit. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it got worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The Bank had to new multi-billion dollar losses announce Chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 the Board of Directors at the second-best paid the Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS faced collapse in the face of their bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the State. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank bought from UBS for tens of billions problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation were six billion Swiss francs for a forced-convertible bond which she could become co-owner of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed it is dramatic for a small country, if it is home to large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the total assets of UBS was 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of the Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again we could not save UBS&quot;, says Bank researcher Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first disaster the second joined. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with the United States and declared himself ready to give customers vermögender the data, who probably had moved behind taxes with the help of the Bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions including criminal charge. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus the UBS known more or less openly, to have helped in tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that had been their capital has always been in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of deposits. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central divisions within a few months: in investment banking through the false speculation and asset management through the help of tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just as it was a bit quiet, just as you thought, now the UBS will manage again, because this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single merchant shipping audited EUR 1.7 billion, before the Bank realizes that something has gone wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it will be obvious: with the risk management in investment banking it doesn&apos;t obviously always still. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;With the fall of Adoboli one has realise that controlling risk has changed too little&quot;, says Martin Janssen, an economist and Professor of finance at the banking institution of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also the CFO of a major German bank is sure: &quot;The problem of UBS is that she has the control not under control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> While it had been but just the idea of caution, with the Swiss came to bankers long ago, to be guardians of the great assets of the world: no excessive risks, ensure security for the money - the world liked break down beyond the Alpine Republic times. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the elegant Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Already the situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank is headquartered at the Zurich railway station road, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are palatial, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers like Tiffany&apos;s can be found here between Swiss tradition shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries, the Swiss banks reside here: by the National Bank of the Palace of the Credit Suisse up to elite private banks like Julius Baer. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Entering the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are marble streamlined, prior to that, thick leather chair next to the Bank logo are a great sign to the &quot;safe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what is looking for the customer here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have displaced but eventually this idea of the Swiss bank - or betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Rather he wants to read his name in the newspaper, finally he makes business like all Swiss Bankers, also with the two big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS has become far too big, he - finds particularly in investment banking, where also the Anglo-Saxons had spread. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss would have to say nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if they are, they have adapted long customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact it was investment banking which changed the UBS, earned her first high profits, and then the debacle the Anglo-Saxon: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub prime jungle such as the Swiss banking giant. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On October 15, 2008, the disaster was visible. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest bailout in the history of their nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS Crash&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros granted the politicians to save the standing before bankruptcy major bank. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could it happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> Talking with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks teamed up to a huge group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> It was a bank that was too big on the merger grew for the small Switzerland - and always on. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Helped that two different precursor banks of UBS complemented himself: a rich, but sleepy Bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers conveniently came to much money they could use to turn a giant wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are connected with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 CEO of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I always thought, Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team&quot;, says Bank researcher Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Wuffli, the high intellectuals, humble, who understands much of models and statistics and Ospel, the belly man who is above has worked up by the banking apprenticeship until quite.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel had rely finally on Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: &quot;He thought his models were the reality,&quot; says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: high spirits came before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of UBS clearly remember the managers meetings, where CEO Wuffli were repeated from same slogan: Goldman Sachs come from the throne. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It led to the &quot;League tables&quot;, leaderboards, documenting the success of the banks of at the time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then, UBS wanted to at the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps were already succeeded her. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the foreign exchange and equities trading she starred at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Management consultant, which were commissioned, but stressed a weakness: in the international business of interest, in the language of the bankers &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there is a huge distance to the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS have gaps in American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that the existence of almost cost them. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry invested for growth, both the Bank itself as well before their based hedge funds in American subprime assets. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It developed itself into a huge machine, which packaged securities based on us mortgage loans and submitted further - retained risks but also themselves. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks long searched for the phase-out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;UBS there has bought in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market on fire,&quot;, says Bank expert violinist. </seg>
<seg id="958"> So great euphoria, so the case deep. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A Manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were harder than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Post at UBS became the ejection seat and are still shaky. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads the banking giant, has a nearly impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He must find a strategy for a Bank, which all nearby business models are on hand come. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bank research Geiger has already an idea: an end to investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Quite so far the Bank wants to not go though (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking is to shrink significantly, so much is already clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, the new Bank Chief Sergio Ermotti of the world will present its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was intended only as a temporary solution, as the Bank is surprisingly by predecessor Grübel separated. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime he has prevailed: he is to permanently carry on the business of UBS, Zurich Bank communicated on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants to return mid-nineties to the Investment Bank to the State. </seg>
<seg id="970"> He deletes 3500 places. </seg>
<seg id="971"> This is not enough however. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What will she make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions, which now already turns Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly, he only says he will look once an apartment in Zurich with his wife. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>

<seg id="993"> That agreed the US investors skeptical: &quot;we are not an island, but dependent on&quot;, Steve Goldman of Goldman management said. </seg>
<seg id="994"> Europe can rid themselves so quickly from recession, also there is a further sign of weakness in the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether strong enough is, to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said Europe in an interview with CNBC. </seg>
<seg id="996"> That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks. </seg>

<seg id="1013"> In many places, rooks are considered &quot;Problem birds&quot;: but the highly intelligent animals can no longer distribute from the cities, experts claim. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> Some love it, others want to get rid quickly: crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities, residential complaints pile of dirt and noise of animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> It is a remedy for the &quot;problem&quot;birds not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Rooks were from the cities not out more to get, said experts at the first symposium of the Crow in the East Frisian leer. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> There, specialists from all over Germany of possible resources advised. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> Looking for alternatives in the cities </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Conservationists attributed the problems in cities it also to the rural exodus of the specially protected rooks: the use of chemicals in agriculture are increasingly destroyed traditional habitats. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical breeding trees the birds made difficult life. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> Crows are. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There are large colonies more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the Northwest in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim, near Bremen, among others, as well as empty. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> There, a controversial project to the mass killing of crows in the district had 2005 created negative headlines. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Critics had called the trapping of animals in some and the slaying with clubs particularly brutal. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> &quot;Nothing brings the normal displacement, the Vergrämen,&quot; the urban and landscape designers detected empty Werner Klöver from. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Nests away spraying with water or trees cut, have often undesirable consequences, the environmental expert Manfred Emperor of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg, also said. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> &quot;The animals back out, split large colonies on and distribute elsewhere.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Vergrämung is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, old people&apos;s homes or schools. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> &quot;We have to live with them, we no longer get away.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Without the surrounding area leave does not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner out empty. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> A combination of Vergrämen of animals from sensitive residential and bait advertising is possible to resettle them again in other places. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> &quot;Information boards instead of chain saws&quot; recruited, however, the psychologist and anthropologist UTA Maria of Jürgens for an entirely different use of the animals: &quot;we can finally best confidently endured A pimple on the face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Had crows trail co-founded Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein the ash&apos;s, where signs of life the highly intelligent rooks inform. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> The project will now already adopted by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Also to the criticism of the noise of the birds, an opinion had Jürgens: &quot;There is plenty of communication, who have to say much.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1036"> The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: rooks use tools not only to get a treat, but even make your tool as a tool. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Behavioural scientist of at Cambridge of University tested recently on four rooks, how far does the intelligence of birds. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> In an experiment, the birds soon learned that they must bring a framework with stones down, so to obtain a moth larva. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Without much training, they realized purposefully what size and shape must have a stone to make the platform collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In a second attempt, the clever crows had to then solve a kniffligeres problem. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> In a vertically set cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> With its beak, the birds could not reach their prey. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> However the researchers had put pieces of wire them. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> From this, all four animals formed a hook, which they then angelten the bucket on the handle from the tube. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Three of the four rooks this was even at the first attempt. </seg>

<seg id="1260"> Here&apos;s a tip, what you could do: simply cutting out this page carefully and make them to your bookmarks. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You will learn about these people in Englunds romanhafter story very well. And these principals will work as your GPS as a lighthouse in those few moments where you lost men and women in the fog of war such as Englunds and your illusions are deprived. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He has written an extraordinary book that he describes as &quot;a work of anti-history&quot; not poorly. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains just a few big names, major contracts or famous battles. There is little Ambassador, rabid reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is less a book about what happened, he said but rather &quot;a book about it, as it was&quot;. It is of &quot;Emotions, impressions, experiences and moods&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> &quot;Beauty and terror&quot; almost the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war together, schoolgirl and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people are heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some become prisoners of war, lose a limb, be crazy, or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Each of these life flickers as the Votivkerzen in a church, some come, while others go out. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Englunds book differs from the usual history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the devastating atmosphere on the Western front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> &quot;Beauty and terror&quot; moves with expert views on other battlefields: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> Fall beehives on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Almost from the outset, this is a moving book. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war flooded the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, which smells of cordite. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and cannon fire heard in the distance. Stay or take flight? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Whoever comes at all? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly anyone understands what happens or why this war ever occurs. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &quot;Missing facts&quot;, Englund notes &quot;were with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors revamped.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &quot;Beauty and horror&quot; follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories were collected mainly memories, letters and other already published material. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are very alive in Englunds of losing details collection of small moments. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them deal with shortages and to manage. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the history of a German Schulmädchens, telling: &quot;replacement, anywhere replacement.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &quot;Coffee substitute, fake aluminium, false Eraser, paper associations, buttons.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He tells more of the spare supper in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes &quot;meat, was made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and most recently was served with a wrong bones made of wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato peelings, shoes that were besohlt with wood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There was, as he recorded &quot;837 registered food substitutes who were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered substitutes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories deal with honor and bravery. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes his own urge to the savagery and says about the war: &quot;One feels that is that despite everything, what more was intended for men to sit with the Abendblatt bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, as in an armchair, and to do so, when such a facade mean civilization, and as if there were no barbarism behind the own stronger and MISTED Shirtfront.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he will probably die and nobody of note taking or worry about. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If you take distance from thought, to sacrifice themselves, one would like to think that this is done before an audience&quot;, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead, it is as terrible as &quot;a convicted man who was hanged in secret.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations be of old Europe, which falls apart, and new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &quot;The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition,&quot; Englund writes &quot;a war between the factories.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> He begins a the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the still-young century&quot;: &quot;The word applied and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit, which slaughters, while behind a desk sitting.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also frivolous behavior such as heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Englund discusses the soldiers actively trying to infect himself with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease to escape the Frontdienst. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &quot;The grotesque expression can be detected in the trade of gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and is smeared on their genitals to come in the hope, as in the hospital&quot;, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &quot;Those who were really desperate, rubbing it in the eye, what caused that they were blind to the rest of their lives.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from Swedish by Peter graves, Englunds poetry is supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts itself perfectly to his human duty. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes he captures a way, like war &quot;unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People are starting to wonder why they bring their leaders to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the first world war were usually rather distorted like Paul Fussells &quot;great war and modern memory&quot; or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque &quot;West nothing new&quot; as a comprehensive history books. </seg>

<seg id="1307"> His book has the worst end, from which I&apos;ve read in a non-fiction book. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I am no longer produced it. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he would have caught us off with his book of this page with the main characters in the face and lit with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After an early mistake a meticulously planned assault </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore use helmets. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> We opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are hardly any people in the Zucotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials have been informed. All the others initially believed to take part in an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that put the operation full of challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> The events of the last few weeks as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which is against the rules of the program and provided a huge increase in public sympathy with the squatters, allowed to repeat themselves no longer. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Officials had prepared them by they were watching how occupations in other cities were handled. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall&apos;s Iceland. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Officials increased the so called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the quick set of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The command to move into the Park, came &quot;at the last minute&quot;, said someone who with commanding the familiar is what spoke for a declaration as an &quot;Exercise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &quot;The few police officers who I know were involved did not know that it went around the Zuccotti Park&quot;, someone who wishes to remain anonymous said. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &quot;The only ones who knew that it went around the Zuccotti Park, were the senior officials of the Department.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that had come to the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 October, officials wanted to give the Park, differed back then but, when hundreds of protesters along came after they had learned of these plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Officials of from different police units were involved in the operation Tuesday, including Einsatzkommando from throughout the city - hundreds of mobile official, usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the Park enter and leave, almost like commuters, so that 1 am is a good time in the night to go. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &quot;It was appropriate to do so, if the minimum number of people in the Park,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Ambulance with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt drive near the Manhattan Bridge. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lamps and the prerecorded messages that boomed from the speakers, many protesters seemed to intimidate. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> As the public officials invaded their bright blue jackets in the Park, many protesters cover together simply their belongings and left the place. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Police said that by 1: 45 P.m. no tents would be handled, to give the protesters time to pack their belongings and goods together. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of officials were seen, how they are gathered in the area, to intervene, arrests in the Park should be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Reporters were forced to leave the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul j. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of police, said that this had happened to their own safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists say that you wanted to keep them from, to observe the police actions in the Park. And they said the handling of civil servants had been very rough. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Browne said that television trucks had can make the Park photos in Church Street on the West side. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> When were moving the police towards the West by the great confusion on personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf, and bags with clothes, followed her the cleansing Department employees who picked up what was left. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some protesters who refused to go were to dragged out there. Pictures about this appeared a short time later on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A main core of protesters took position in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the Centre of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some erected barriers and police continued their methodical arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied together on her arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Civil protection officials were called to lot what. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> As Mr Kelly said, no arrests in the park were conducted until about 3: 30. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Browne said that 142 people in the park were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The most arrests occurred, he said, because of &quot;Improper behavior and resistance to an arrest&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph j. Esposito, the head of the Department, the highest uniformed official in the Department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil t. Pulaski, Department Chief of detectives, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Despite his presence &quot;Mr. Kelly directed&quot; &quot;the operation not&quot;, as Mr Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> In the event that they should be accessed, waited a second group of officials on the East side of Broadway, between liberty and Cedar streets. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> Barricades were erected at Cortlandt Street, a block north of the Park, and in the Pine Street, one block further South. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It could be observed as from these locations the police further expanded the perimeter around the Zuccotti Park around. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> In one place many of them with obstruct, persons observed, as several officials after drove out there. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> About 28 persons were located in the Northern District. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the South of the Park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> At 5 P.m. a protesters on the roof of a police vehicle jumped South of Pine Street and other protestors let out the air of the tyre of a police bus. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> The amount a piece of plywood threw in one place. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the end of an official and a protesters to the hospital came. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Trade Union of the workers will submit complaint against the city due to layoffs </seg>
<seg id="1362"> The Union, which represents hundreds of school workers that their jobs lost last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies due to their inappropriate influence on the schools, teaching poor students, were unnecessary and discriminatory. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The suit is probably the last option which is still open to the Trade Union, District Council 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Six hundred Zweiundsiebzig school volunteers, care coordinators and other staff who belonged and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, have described the leaders as political revenge for that one last year had refused access to a health fund, the working groups entertained, the city, with which the budgetary gap should be closed to the worst paid employees of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> This accusation categorically rejected by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council Dennis M. Walcott, Director of schools, said last month the redundancies were part of the budget that we have adopted in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the City Council fired back and explained to him that in the budget not specify that the school help people would be laid off. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials of the 37 City Council said they had and the Ministry of education warned a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference, on the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan is formally announced. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The action is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of education of the city as defendants list and score eight laid-off workers as plaintiff, which are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said the complaint would be not for the city, and thus their individual claims could not be commented. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a case design that is the New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the poor districts of the city, to support an action for unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools would have lost more helpers, because they are chronically under-funded. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> You sets forth that while there were no redundancies to Staten Iceland and only a few redundancies in the schools of the upper east side or TriBeCa, lost 17 school helper in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers in the 8 and 9 in the South Bronx districts were dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Noting the loss of five of eight school workers who were employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students in poverty live, the lawsuit says: &quot;This is no neighborhood of wealthy parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.S.: The budget of 36. District was reduced this year by 3.26 percent. Also, funds were lost when the city changed their method of calculation for the extra funding for any poor schools enrollment. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The Union also complained that the heads of high schools were discharged by the language in a memo to mislead, which approved the dismissal of care coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo used the English word &quot;excess&quot;, to describe the action, even if &quot;excess&quot; (German: transfer) in the United States usually the change of a teacher from the payroll of a school in a pool available workers describes, which are paid by the Central Office. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &quot;Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred,&quot; States the action design. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission ended, Congress prepared with regard to Libya communicate </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It finally looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already, to communicate with regard to the riots in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Everything that was necessary for this purpose was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate approves a resolution, which is under the Chairman John Kerry (mass.) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), where it praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their &quot;courage&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &quot;This resolution honors the brave people of Libya, who have started with the reconstruction of their country,&quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &quot;It&apos;s a confirmation of support its democratic efforts by two parties.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may sound innocent, but so far, nothing was easy in the Libya debate. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a number of resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain put forward a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law has been rejected by a broad fringe group of both parties in the Senate and there was no vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day this Bill in the Senate fell through. In addition, the Chamber overrode a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Thus the U.S. Mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory — with a Congress that was indeed upset enough to criticize Obama&apos;s approach, within the framework of the mission but not angry enough to finally pull away the ground him. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then, the indecision of the Congress of the events was overhauled. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> NATO&apos;s mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The Senate is now perhaps ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Resolution of the Committee on international relations &quot;congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation&quot; and &quot;praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners that support the military operations to protect of the people in Libya, for their exceptional bravery and their professionalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also reaffirmed &quot;the national interests of the United States on Libya a successful and irreversible transition to democracy&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Will the new measures receive the full support by the Panel for foreign relations or are they the lawmakers split, as did the law of June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), of the Committee&apos;s top Republican. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has still not seen the final version of the new law. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> According to the United States Capitol, it lies on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional Legislaturperiode of the Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or other area, which currently comes to a vote in the Senate or Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their changes, although they have tried often enough to vote. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattes change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that were submitted to this Congress and include a whole range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are duplicated--the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate and others differ only slightly. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are at least 15 versions of the change in compensation budget and a further dozen that &quot;would control federal spending&quot; alone in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are also identical, but they admit the possibility that their clients - especially beginners at the Republicans who want to Polish up your CV - brag that they &quot;have authored such a measure&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The budget control Act, which was passed in August, requires that Congress about a change of equilibrium as well as Senate vote. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 Senators for a non-binding resolution voted, supports the idea of such a change. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The budget also, some members want can submit the number of provisions, members of Congress, limit, while the Republican wants to remove the limit of two terms of President Jose E. Serrano (New York). </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has a number of changes proposed, which guarantee, inter alia, the right to a good education and health care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> A change that prohibits marriage under sex is a recurring template as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators want to also allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the States reject them. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> As eager as the members suggest changes, so non-faster they move like in the past. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> 111. Congress submitted legislation of 77 such changes. 110. Congress 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace pales in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members every two years suggested regularly more than 150 changes, so the numbers that makes the Senate library. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they were not much better than today&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last change that add is - the 27-, ratified in 1992, proposed but in fact already in 1789 to the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &quot;Hit, but not defeated&quot;, so Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after an armed man from closest distance had shot during an election rally in Tucson on them, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) occurred Monday night on national television. You sang alone at the Broadway play &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said the desire to recover, is greater than the to return to Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in &quot;20 / 20&quot; ABC News, rank it according to and needed help walking. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The broadcast showed heavy slow recovery from the damage that caused the bullet that pierced her skull split, the left side of their brain and crosses her head from the front to rear. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago she returned surprisingly in the Congress, to cast their votes to the debt brake triumphantly. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In her first television interview after the assassination in January, killed six people and injured 13 in which smiled Gifford, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: &quot;Quite good.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour &quot;20/20&quot; specials, recorded shortly before the release of the new book of the couple: &quot;Gabby: A story about courage and hope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The special tracks Giffords recovery since the assassination of the January 8. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in the hospital bed, with bald-shaven head and a long scarf over the forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> She can raise only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged it. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Giffords months later sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod his head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A twitching with the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, her first words: &quot;What.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After a few days Giffords whispers another word: &quot;Toast&quot;. She want that their breakfast is changed. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos that play on the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords&apos; recovery: man looks like the members of Congress along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers &quot;girls just wanna have fun&quot; and Tom of petty&apos;s &quot;Free Fallin&apos; &apos;&quot; sings. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> Giffords who spends two hours a day with therapy, that she can not remember the day of the attack, said in an interview with Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that he had read an article in a newspaper about the assassination Giffords on 12 March, had been killed when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after six people during the assassination. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly medically treated, while he waits for his trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> &quot;Many people have died,&quot; told Giffords Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> &quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the course of recovery of his wife, so told Kelly Sawyer, she said: &quot;I was hit.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &quot;So, I would say:&quot;Gabby, you&apos;re not defeated&quot;?&quot;, Kelly said. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You have just taken. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you will get this through and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops feel more pity than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street Gala, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Gathered on a keyword to one hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The crowd in black Tuxedo stood up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &quot;The soldiers and servicemen were seen as heroes&quot;, said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer at the Gala, which was observed by the Chief of staff and former Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, looked different to the role played by the troops. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &quot;They were introduced such as orphans,&quot; wrote the officer in an E-Mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I&apos;m sure the organizers have meant it well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it really wasn&apos;t no respect. It was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the American public usually distanced, sometimes admiring. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops will be showered with praise for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has its price, say Dienstangehörige. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The general public behaves suffering increasingly so, as it did the people in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We were not victims&quot;, said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in the Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But apparently is the only way that support is the one to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who want to appear not ungrateful or in conflict with the public which they serve. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They have also recognized that the rage in recent years of the Viet Nam war against struck the returning troops, was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result, talks about compassion in the breastfeeding and private between veterans of war take place. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons from fights with the Marines have returned, the Colonel (Ret.) mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military realm could see their service from two different perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would regard it with a sense of AWE as she rebels defeated and traveled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would wonder whether a &quot;raging, violent veteran beneath the surface&quot; hides, said Cancian, who had fought in the Iraq and has acquired a high State post in Washington after his return. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his employment, he said he felt that some of the interviewers subtly erfragten whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions, however,&quot; Cancian explained his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The missing ease of the military is rooted in part on behalf of the Americans in the war missing. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Services on the battlefield will be from a country that has little experience with the military, and sees little benefit in the wars in the Iraq and Afghanistan, singled out rarely as praise. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;We as a nation appreciate military heroism no longer so, as it was absolutely normal in the second world war&quot;, said Lieutenant General David Barno (Ret.), who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks that they have endured, the number of friends who have lost, or the severity of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Military is under increasing pressure to the harsh crackdown on rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, a major hearing decides whether 28 women and men are indicted for non-intervention in a rape before the military court. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> Should it happen not hundreds of applicants for the next hearing are available. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Upper Gefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 week pregnant, when she was raped by a soldier colleagues at night. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and returned straight to their barracks in Miramar, North of San Diego from dinner with a friend, when she met a male colleague, a 12 Pack wearing beer with him. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her whether he should accompany them for a drink in your room. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;My alarm bells went on,&quot; said Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texas brushed aside their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: &quot;Oh what, is he 19.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;He is from Texas,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after they had walked in Lyman&apos;s room, was the man behind her, pressed it down and raped her, she claimed. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> Lyman and 27 other present and former military employees anxiously waiting this week, on 18 November, for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided whether a complaint they have collected against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed in court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The suit alleges that gates and Rumsfeld right of the soldiers are those that have not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In February by Susan Burke, submitted a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the suit initially 17 plaintiffs, which rose but in the following months to 28 included: 25 men and three women, who all claim that by colleagues of the soldiers have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failure to identify, condemn or appropriate case law after the alleged attack to make a., </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says she follow the top military leadership since the problem there will start. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The military is hierarchically built,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the individuals that are in the position, the culture retaliation to eradicate the?&quot; &quot;The leadership.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future actions. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Their strategy: instead that all plaintiffs lay eggs in a basket so to speak, they will submit, if necessary, many more complaints, to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of defence for the Ministry of defence, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, submitted a request to dismiss the lawsuit. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The files of the Court, which are Newsweek, lead to in detail the defense strategy in the first place, that the military can, are accused by current or former soldiers for violations which have occurred in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Pursuant to a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, liable the Government not for injuries, which currently soldiers are added to the active duty. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &quot;The alleged damages during the military service of the applicant&quot;, says the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Ministry denied any comment on this story. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women still not to serve in the fight are allowed, so the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both the Iraq and Afghanistan play increasingly important roles, especially in contact establish teams of soldiers with local women in the war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars 150 servicemen died two thirds of them in combat. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that the military is being modernised, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And she is not alone in their fight: three more complaints except their are pending. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School the Veterans&apos; prepares legal a lawsuit against the four main military academies due to alleged support of a misogynistic atmosphere services clinic. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Thereof regardless which collects non-profit Viet Nam Veterans of America a lawsuit against the military before, where the diagnosis of &quot;Personality disorder&quot; focusing, received the rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a usual practice according to activists such as ANU Bhagwati of service women&apos;s action network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> In December, her group filed lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (GER.: management of the war veterans), in which she her discriminatory practices in her dealings with power demands for persons accused, which stated that to be sexually abused been in service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws was submitted independently the Congress through a mixture of Senators and representatives of both parties, providing a series of clues. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> 2010 were according to the sexual assault prevention and response Office (German: Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) displayed DoD 3,158 sexual abuses. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But the most abuses are not reported at all, and on the Pentagon&apos;s own estimate account this number approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases which occur each year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, which was published in March, examined the law enforcement rates: 2010 20 per cent of recorded cases in the military court came, only half as many as in civil law. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in Burke&apos;s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In Lyman&apos;s case she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, so she says she was asked 11 times to tell the details of their rape of a number of policemen, doctors, and military commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex it had before the attack with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people said as Charakterzeugen in the name of the alleged offender who was ultimately acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember well the day when the verdict was read out&quot;, says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I thought the contractions would use.&quot; &quot;I ran screaming from the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;They brought me in the psychiatric department and I remember that I, when I came out, said to my Commander: this was not his procedure.&quot; &quot;That was my method.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder, and declared for members. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she was dishonourably dismissed so that she receive no support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, progress, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of law at the George Washington University law school. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nevertheless, as he noted: &quot;My opinion they should come forward.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What is between them and a verdict is this doctrine which is criticized, since it was taken for the first time in question. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Throughout his life, I am a critic of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>

<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, what occurs also as first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: how researchers watch on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti immigration opinion online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday Breivik, who has been committed in a killing spree in Norway in July to have, where 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has much time spent to his attack before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists, who support extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find it? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This is easy - you must log in only on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We have noticed that it was not difficult to get to them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report of the British think-tank DEMOS of digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook&apos;s hiding place personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the advertising tool of page, to set your desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - so how marketers for years do it. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlett&apos;s team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups throughout Europe and she proposed to then adds, but instead of going with a new band or a new diet product to link, the adds invited users to a survey, in which according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and assessing their own future was asked. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Bartlett and his colleagues able to consult more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without them even once had to leave her Office were thanks to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;It is a new research method,&quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results hardly surprising. Online sponsors of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and fret about immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a surprising twist &quot;those who combine their online activism with an offline activism rational, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> DEMOs work is just one example, as Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Idea factories, scientist and medical researchers are using the site, to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in &quot;Likes&quot;, text messages and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook&apos;s &quot;Data Supernova&quot; generates a research boom, who in the past five years to nearly 800% increase in the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers, it is beauty of Facebook the fact that one can study through this site people, that is usually not reached his Clipboard on the road. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;If you previously tried to interview people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You had to first inform the party and would have granted never access them,&quot; Bartlett says. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;On Facebook falls it all away - you go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the page provides a way to identify social health problems and to solve. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook tend significantly more to the problem drinking as students who were silent on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno proposes equal students, such as the residential Advisor, to monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;You can not solve a problem, if you have not recognized&quot;, said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno co-author and Director of child health, behavior and development at children&apos;s Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook taps constantly to the data of its own population. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The data team of page has created statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine&apos;s day, turnout at the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (and first and foremost information were used, that only Facebook has access - master of digital freedom for a long time know that the page should make available their large data found mine to others for research purposes.) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> However, the users of Facebook know that the page they observed whether they now want that or not. With a friend who is thousands of miles away to be able to play Scrabble, to bring out the own personal data allows one the page. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what, if the users of Facebook are part of a survey, which they don&apos;t even know something? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have laid down strict guidelines, how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I don&apos;t think that many users of the fact thought that a researcher might study their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;As regards it, went there only to them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information provided in a user profile and contributions are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What they say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things&quot; says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology research that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;There is no substitute for this to get out into the real world and to speak with real people&quot;, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;Social research must worry about the social - and social life of lots of takes place yet always offline.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed two rampages where this summer 77 people were killed in Norway, has described fighters even in its first appearance in a public court in Oslo as a &quot;resistance&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I&apos;m a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway,&quot; he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I raise an objection to the Court because you have received your mandate of organizations that support the ideologies of hate and this supports the multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he &quot;not wanted to allow Breivik, to take advantage of this consultation, on which he can express his views as a platform.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought an advance written speech, permission to use at the end of the hearing on the relatives of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also arranged that retains the Breivik police for 12 more weeks in custody, four weeks has no access to the media. He said that the authorities over a period of eight weeks exactly will control all visits and all correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some were hoping to be able to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All took part in order that everything on a closing off amounts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;I thought he looks cold and inhuman,&quot; a survivor told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK about Utoya. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I&apos;ve seen the suspects and heard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik wore a dark suit and blue tie and worked during the whole hearing, calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered the building and left. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breiviks bizarre note, he would be part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill the judge and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Like some like it, that apparently the work of a single extremists was the attacks on 22 July and not the a group radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But this automatically facilitates the grief and the confusion that still feels a whole nation? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do&quot;, said the family members of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;It would be so much easier if he would do it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 Lessons of the interview with the late Steve jobs, which was shown in a theater this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve jobs on 5 October, some comparing it to Henry Ford and thereby stressed the engineering genius as a large modern inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What Apple fans but perhaps most aufschlussreichsten find jobs-interview recently again discovered, which was dusted down this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative mind understands business processes and workflows. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organiser who worked diligently on charts - a man who believed that many Managing Director suffer from &quot;a disease of thought&quot;, &quot;that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work...&quot; [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> 1995 developed Bob Cringely TV-series &quot;Triumph of the specialist&quot; on the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat with longer than one hour jobs, where they led a rare, detailed discussions. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At this time were as 10 years passed since jobs from Apple was marginalized. And he was already hard working on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in specialist, he says that the copy templates of the interview in the delivery were missing. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Only after jobs death discovered a full copy of the VHS in the garage of the Director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minuetigen film &quot;Steve Jobs: the lost interview&quot;, which is this Wednesday and Thursday at the landmark theater. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who has known that he abhors extensive interviews, jobs appears here surprisingly eager in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interview there is 10 or 15 seconds contemplation, where jobs weigh his thoughts clearly and order accuracy is trying four times longer pauses between question and answer. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments in which jobs&apos; perfectionism is days when he seemingly impatient responds to Cringelys questions and it anschubst, to respond faster to issues or subplots of greater significance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded the lost interview appears somehow weird far-sighted if jobs rated, what do other companies of in his view true or false and represents its own vision on the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to read posthumous tributes of career jobs&apos;. But here to see jobs, who is on the verge of greatness, as the greedy dreamer is something completely different, original and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things could be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Shortly after he everything had done this here, he moved off and made it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> He learned how to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &quot;During the whole year in the business, I always ask:&quot;Why you are doing things?&quot;.&quot; And the answer that you get always, is: &quot;Oh, so it is done simply.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really in-depth thinking about things. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I&apos;ve found that. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Further, jobs performs his efforts to streamline the accounts at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Dumbfounded, as costs were recorded - usually began with standard cost&quot;&quot;, were estimated at a mere presumption towards, which were then adapted with &quot;Deviation&quot; - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the costs could be determined up to the smallest. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How was ridiculing the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> A device with which one could creep into the telephone company and long distance lead free tells of the &quot;blue box&quot;, which he has built with Steve Wozniak, jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Much has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He also describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, make a call and is then connect by an AT &amp;amp;amp;amp; T network to another while she grinding as many satellites as possible through. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &quot;We sent things a half a dozen times around the globe and when you grölte in the phone, it came out a minute later next door back in the phone,&quot; chuckling tells jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &quot;We were young and we learned that we ourselves can build something, that can control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> We both, we knew not much but we were able to build this small thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don&apos;t think that Apple would be without them. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs retold from a glorious prank the Wozniak and he almost had deducted, when she called box in the Vatican in the dead of the night via blue and wanted to speak with the Pope, while it as best they could have made to Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the dead of night to talk with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself on the phone came. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As he fell in the technology (and unprepared called Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts, to build a frequency counter, he sought Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, jobs got a part time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &quot;That had a remarkable influence on me.&quot; &quot;It was the only company that I&apos;d seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company and how well it treated its employees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later became jobs of one of HP employees who visited the laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer that ever made&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love in him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would climb upwards at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine, and write programs for it. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How to improve innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview talks jobs in, how you invent spontaneously new products. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He worked with a payment of only 30 days and had to think through both the Assembly and the delivery of the finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later at Apple he remembers the problems that he had in the development of a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &quot;I remember disruptive arguments...&quot; &quot;They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we build them for $15. That was incredibly believable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> About large companies that allow to: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he revive Apple, jobs predicted the paths on which so many industrial giants with their visions came in tripping and lost control of their shares. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &quot;We say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, na and?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Have the monopoly on share, so the company is no longer successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are such people], which eventually lead the company and the product with which the people from decision-making are pushed. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product genius that has led to this monopoly is eradicated vs. bad products, people who have no concept about good products - craftsmanship necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This happened at Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox would have to have the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> You could have ten times greater, could have the Microsoft of the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> You have caught defeat from victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> About innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> &quot;A lot of handicraft, situated between a great idea and a great product... If you developed this great idea, she changed and is growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> You can learn much about its intricacies. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> You shall provide votes, certain things that you can&apos;t, but electrons, robot, glass factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You must memorize 5000 terms, these concepts, and they all bring together... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Ultimately it boils down to the taste, it boils down to that one, apart sits down with the best stuff that people have created, and then seeks to bring together these things on what to do. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We are always shameless in stealing great ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Part of what made great Macintosh, was that the people who work there, musician, poet, artist, zoologist, historian were, which happen to be the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> It was not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws, as court takes case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> A day, around which the Supreme Court behind closed doors gather, to discuss the question of political sharing, whether it will hear a challenge of health laws by President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas attended, a dinner, which sponsored was by the law firm that represented the case to court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday, when met all nine members to a meeting to discuss the petitions to the test. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of to treated cases was an action which raised 26 States against the far-reaching health care reform last year adopted by the Congress, a law that anywhere was at the conservative activists in the United States a buzzword. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judge agreed to the hearing. Actually a 5 is expected in March 1/2-hour basis for discussion, that probably will stimulate probably 2012 the presidential campaign whose outcome, which will be in full swing at the time at which the Court&apos;s decision is announced,. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who before court and claim, that the law is to tilt, probably Paul Clement will, once Attorney-General under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, a long-established group, dedicated to the defense of conservative principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another undertaking, the dinner made, Jones day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of independent business, which challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> An another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., is greatly involved in financially as a result of the process. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner took place a few hours after the Court about the case had advised, in a Washington Hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform, among others had service </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: for years, the two judges attend events of the federalist society. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And that would not violate moral rules. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Indeed to judge of the code of conduct free, which governs the actions of the lower federal judge. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> They were there, they would fall probably 4 (c) of the code under principle, which States the following: &quot;A judge may on fundraisers law near and other participating organizations, where the judge no speaker, guest of honour or according to the program, not a guest of such events may be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas were to two of related the case relating law firms as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this from, to alert the morality and Government activists. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This amazing break with morality and the contrast with the code lie punishes the actions of some judges, the Court think the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, President of common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &quot;The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings of the Court.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their occurrence and their support of a fundraiser for this event undermined any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would too easily mix legal issues with groups that be guided from the agenda, like for example the federalist society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And that Thomas&apos; wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> However, claim the Conservatives that it was judge Elena Kagan, have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama rule, the first law disputes in the first instance court. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias, because it involved too much in defense of the law, to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan makes no move to do so. </seg>

<seg id="1685"> Airline ordered 50 two-course aircraft of type Boeing 777s with an option for 20 more aircraft Emirates. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> In addition Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $ 1 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is really a rare message that a company gets an order for 50 units of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it is a big business, if is the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is a record amount of $18 trillion. </seg>

<seg id="1697"> &quot;The quality of this particular customer is very high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines of the Middle East are in the possession of the oil-producing countries. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> So, they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, it is an increase in oil prices, which harms the airlines generally, because this is one of their biggest cost is not so harmful, as worthy of the country to a higher oil price. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important, because they tend less than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders or move, if oil prices rise, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &quot;You have a natural hedge,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The order Emirates confirmed Boeing&apos;s leading position in the market for wide-body aircraft and helps to keep the SAS Airbus competitor in chess, attacking the supremacy with the A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&apos;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would move the introduction of largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. </seg>

<seg id="1709"> According to the preliminary results of the institutional the Revolutionary Party, the PRI, Fausto Vallejo has won the race for Governor in the Western State. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Luisa María Calderón said &quot;The intrusion of organized crime during the entire electoral processes, and especially in yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country&quot;, in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls...&quot; &quot;They have booths occupied, roads built up... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI].&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled the Presidency seven decades in Mexico, until they in 2000 lost. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But they strive for a return and in Michoacán, the victory is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to have just defeated Claderon, which still led in the polls before election day. </seg>

<seg id="1722"> The violence is still continuing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during an election debate for Luisa María Calderón and numerous candidates has risen out of fear from the local elections. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> For the PRI victory strengthens the party, no matter, the elections in Michoacán also appear as distasteful. </seg>

<seg id="1730"> &quot;We are all in the same boat.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> &quot;So everyone is helpful, which can help Europe out of this crisis,&quot; he told the financial times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> &quot;Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &quot;If China and India so can help then by all means.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Europe&apos;s Monetary Union came in the past months in a serious debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The past few days Italy&apos;s interest costs increased to dangerous and the Prime Minister both Italy and Greece are resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The emerging heavy debt crisis in Europe stoking fears that it could plunge the global economy into recession and led to calls the leading emerging economies would have to do together to support the euro-zone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr nag predicted that any support of Asia is channelled through the IMF, but said that greater bargaining power offers mutual arrangements - such as for example the purchase of bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Finanzstabilisierungsfazilität (EFSF) - European partners in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that &quot;India will do all what is in its power&quot;, since now suffers the own economy to help the euro area, falling exports and foreign capital flow drying out. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &quot;No one wants that the euro area is still unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1742"> Others argue that developing economies such as India have is no reason to help the rich Europeans if they even face major economic challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million by $2 or even less on the day most live. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated up the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. Thus, he unleashed a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon thinks through reductions in the amount of $450 trillion during the next decade already, but now fears that further cuts to $600 trillion or more necessary be if Congress did not graduate issues can be achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry&quot;, Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure would lead to 23% overall reductions, as well as an end to numerous new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &quot;Such a high reduction performed in such reckless ways, would most of our ship and construction projects make unenforceable - you can buy not three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &quot;We were also forced to involuntarily separate us from most of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certainly, to achieve the goal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously harm.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> &quot;The cuts were ultimately the combat forces meet&quot;, Panetta said. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &quot;While the war time quotas in the fight for against terrorism by the seizure are not directly affected, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort&quot;, Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &quot;Recruitment have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the setting&apos;s attendant, who support the war.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &quot;Would cut the salaries of staff resulting in late payments to war time traders and legal as well as political support would be disturbed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two Senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &quot;The consequences of the confiscation of the Defence Ministry would launch a rapid decline of the United States as a leading military power in the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &quot;We are strongly against this draconian action&quot;, said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they released the Panetta letter. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &quot;This is a result with which we can not live, and it is certainly none that you should push us up.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &quot;The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and whose occurrence should not be allowed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Whether Panetta letter and the new warnings of senators will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or demands will, step up to take the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has expressed increasingly bluntly the possible cuts, although he could gain experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House many years before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is serious decisions to. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a grim picture of what could be - come a military shell, but without core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &quot;There is a ship without sailors.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &quot;It is a Brigade without ammunition.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &quot;It is an air force without sufficient trained pilots.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &quot;It is a force lacking morality and alert and that is not in a position to take on potential opponents.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &quot;You can get a really angry.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta spearheaded new details, such as reductions &quot;creates significant operating risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global deployment and intervention capabilities, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects of strike victim could fall including those that already have been tested and are already in the early planning stages. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> This list includes also the fighter pilot strike fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the army and Navy need F35 joint to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Would you stop the continued development and testing of the F35, would this over the next 10 years save up to $80 trillion, but proponents say it is an important next step for upgrading, so that cannot be dispelled by China and other opponents possible dangers. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How is revealed to be a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the current headlines shows deception and lies in everyday life are how widespread concern and far. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is busy to tackle the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The direction of Penn State is accused of perjury because it allegedly has held back reports, according to which a retired football coach sexually has abused boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week was with a liar heard over an open microphone, as the French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed the American President Barack Obama to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers and shake countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York Congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself fool, when he installed ABDICATIONS in circulation, which were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate of John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing which is related to cover up an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> Then no one who has seen it, forgetting of course the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has thrown when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories about cheating in school and College exams are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There were incidents where teachers have given the exam responses their students, so that they were good even when their performance reviews. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who should teach the opposite, sending a message that lying and cheating are okay. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception are we experiencing? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Studies show that we lie every day between 10 and 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Many of these lies are but considered Marxist. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that stranger lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> To detect lies or &quot;to uncover lies&quot; is one that is important for everyone to learn, both personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a parlor game as away to such charades, in which it is the target, &quot;don&apos;t you!&quot; to call, the Enttarnen of a deception is a serious knowledge based on scientific data, which were collected in the course of the past six decades at prestigious universities, who conducted extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One result of the research is that the most ancient myths about the lies were unmasked. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies look one in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> You stutter, stammer, blush, and suffer not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> From this we may not conclude but that these liars are difficult to uncover and to unmask. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A skilled Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth by he learns about the structure of claims that the fine facial expressions, questions and timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the extensive and ever-growing range of exposure. And it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern capability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding your way around in our complex world especially when setting or the request of persons or negotiations or management belong to the own professional responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are very good to appreciate other people, arousing their interest and control own emotions. And they feel intuitively, as others are perceived. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research we, extroverted people lie more often than introverted people know that men dish up more often &quot;self oriented&quot; lies than women whose lying more &quot;focus on other&quot; - usually, so they want to protect the feelings of others-, that married people less often lie to their partner than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell are usually &quot;fat lies&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that, if a person as a culprit was revealed to be other less feel guilty, to have lied to this person. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How to detect, whether someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First by you observe the normal behavior of this person. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &quot;Baselining&quot;, the starting position. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It is for a reference point to later evaluate changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> They should know better when someone usually constantly trips with the foot, so that they not accuse him if he trips during a meeting with the foot. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then look for clusters of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> See these clusters as alarm bells ringing, shrill as evidence an exposure. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who deceive, maybe freeze when trying to remember their history. Perhaps have their feet towards the door or they sit in the direction of output, change their position in a significant way, or show a &quot;relaxation after the interview&quot;, this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions are over. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Interrogative signal often erroneously that an interview is over, only to this relaxation after the interview to look. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Pay attention also to the language of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The crash of Scott Peterson is famous, as he used the past tense, as he claimed, his dead wife is live and triggered a national search for her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Deceptive people can use a distanzierende language: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with this woman...&quot; &quot;Miss Lewinsky&quot; or if you reviewed a tricky question in a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use &quot;qualifying language&quot;, if they answer a tricky question: &quot;well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know is... to the best of our knowledge and belief.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This, the answer is rather increasingly true as factual, which often ringing alarm bells. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic to the Enttarnen of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which an exposure is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Thanks to these abilities, everyone can be rare victim of scam artists, both in the private like in professional life. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is being revised after exposure by the delayed US approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama Government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which one angered the unions and at the same time calmed environmentalists, the company be built the pipeline aims to reschedule the project so that you can return to normal. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will lead to the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, albeit with a different course. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This occurred after an announcement of the Foreign Ministry last week, after the one you would postpone a decision concerning a federal approval for the project, until the new possible course is verified, which avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> &quot;This is a real step forward,&quot; said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, compared to Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental review, which has ordered the Foreign Ministry may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, although officials deny that politicians in the decision were involved. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama said in a written statement that the decision is a task of the Foreign Ministry last week and said his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 1700 mile pipeline was Canada with the Gulf of Mexico link. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six States. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Environmentalists hate them, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> But the legislature of Nebraska, who are opposed to the plan, weigh the laws to force a move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found out that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that that has requested a separate probe of the review procedure with principal investigator of the Ministry that focuses on two questions. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One is whether a lobbyist who was recruited by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is a conflict of interest. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The other is whether a company was commissioned to carry out the original study, was an inappropriate choice because she is linked with TransCanada. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear to vomit </seg>

<seg id="1844"> It was on 10 November last year, when the stagehands Kevin monk, his wife Corporation, a kindergarten teacher, and Geneviève wanted to break up for a family outing. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> While Kevin monk brought the car, Corporation monk went Boulevard with the luggage and Geneviève on the arm in the lobby in her building at Riverside. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Corporation monk said she had stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> &quot;Someone was behind me and said:&quot;You know what your daughter doing?&quot;&quot; &quot;I said,&quot;Yes&quot;, and went to take it again in his arms,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Labelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> &quot;In an aggressive tone, said:&quot; you should sell your daughter away from the door, said Corporation monk.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1850"> &quot;I told her:&quot;It interests me not what you say or think&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1851"> She became angry and began to scold - it was very noisy and used the F word and the A word... </seg>

<seg id="1855"> Labelle threw himself on the mother, who was still Geneviève on her arm, and had to be held back by their escort and taken to a waiting car, said Corporation monk. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Later, asked the family Labelle in writing for an apology, received but no answer. </seg>

<seg id="1859"> The action is a certain unspecified damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he make no fee charged and the family plan, the money that they get will donate children&apos;s cancer aid. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> &quot;We want that Patti LaBelle takes responsibility for their behavior,&quot; said Davis. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> &quot;This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it opposite a kindergarten teacher on the day, which carries an 18-month-old baby on her arm.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1863"> In his first year, Mario Lopez Valdez is the Government, rose in Sinaloa unemployment and undeclared work, while decreased foreign investment and the economy stagnated. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 Sinaloas in economic history will remain in memory. It is the first year, Mario Lopez Valdez, who identifies himself as the initiator of change and stirred up great expectations regarding economic growth, is in the Government. However, as a result of climatic adversity, no question can be growth, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in the millions in agriculture, but put down narrow limits the growth of Economics in addition and caused a general decline in who goes economic activity by 3.6 per cent this mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development 31,16% in the first quarter back, had a surge impact on other sectors of the economy. </seg>

Above all the vegetables, corn, and chickpea crops were affected. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The decline of economic activity through November have continually rise in the Mexican State unemployment. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, corresponds to what 4.53 per cent of the labour force. In the second quarter the unemployment rate increased to to 5,28% and from July to September 6,19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa resulted. That is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> Lower liquidity </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year comes from several factors. Economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of social sciences of the University Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions will explain the growing unemployment indirectly. </seg>

<seg id="1938"> Counting can be done in its entirety, if after the ordinary calculation determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, assuming it is available an express request by a representative of the party, whose Kandidat has become second. In this case, the choice of packages would be a partial count suspended, excluded. </seg>

<seg id="2037"> For your Costa Rican fans a dream realised, when Pearl Jam in Costa Rica plays: are you aware of you, what does this mean for your fans? </seg>
<seg id="2038"> A dream that is carried out for us is to play in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I have only once been to on vacation in Costa Rica. It is a so wonderful country that we will stay there for even a few days. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> For us, it is exciting to bring our music there. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> I ask you that because the fans of the band are completely revealed. Intensely enjoy the days before the concert. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> What does it say your begeistertesten fans? </seg>

<seg id="2045"> It took us almost 21 years, until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you to have waited so long and sorry to have used, until we came here so long us. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Exert that not a bit pressure from your visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest shows we have pointed out in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have played on a few big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Really, we have a desire to play there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. For this, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> How have their Costa Rica and its waves to surf learn about? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Many of our friends are surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends went to surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Along with Mexico are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we learned them. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Because we there have never played, we set no limitations. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and our fans offer a good and varied repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You are never reviewed your repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think this is partly so because we have nine panels, and you can play over 120 songs. An other song like everyone, so that the decision which we will each play, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> If we take two or three songs that we no longer have been playing in the repertoire, we can maintain better our concentration and they surprise us because they call the reasons to remind us why these songs have liked us. Otherwise, they could get into oblivion. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> This makes the show more interesting for us and I think also for the audience. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour you celebrating your twentieth story. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, is it hard to believe you on your success? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, totally. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I, that nobody has imagined by us once a great rock band to play in, and believe even over 20 years. That seems like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We also continue to this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We like us and are excited to bring forth music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky to be able to drive, we always wanted to visit the places of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could not be better stand. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What it meant for you, to have actively participated in the birth of grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has been always an honor to belong to this group of great bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are friends with the people of Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Alice in chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising and unusually abundant, if a movement emerges from a group of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time come from the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud to be, and are honored to be part of the Seattle group. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes we still play together. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Soundgarden, we saw on their tour. We are pleased to be friends still with all of them, and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle sounds. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very unusual that a band like yours so long remained together with same musicians. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us play since 21 years together and Matt (Cameron) came to us years ago. This is much more time than many bands survive alone. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First of all, I believe that we all of us lucky to be alive, and in addition, we look at each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We all are close friend why themselves musical way have opened, which give each individual the freedom to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> One trusts the other and his music. There could be no better us. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to fame was not always easy. On the other hand you could make that thanks to your success what you wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The way, as we have grown, has made it easier us to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We will make sure to be not too often on tour because it is too easy this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to expire. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as you remember that the people because the music have come that reminds you that you need to take the music and what has called into being, not to be a famous rock star hell bent. That has interests anyway never us. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> What memories do you have of your other project of mother love bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I believe we have written very good songs and at the beginning it was great. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band that had never issued a plate until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) for three years. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still always good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think what was Andy for an incredible person and brought me to laugh as he. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football, and many other topics. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was an extraordinary person and we miss him. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show at Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that you know their work, have chosen especially Eddie Vedder and the band therefore for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos by several groups and this band we liked best. Therefore, we are curious to see, what Las live can provide Robertas. Exciting, which is determined. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> The text of yellow Ledbetter why changing her always when you play live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This is a question for ED (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing comes to him. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> By whom were you influenced as a bass player? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> So many + </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The first covered me include geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many that I could talk all afternoon on the bass player that I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has it managed Pearl Jam alive to keep the grunge, although it no longer is a fad? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we all feel not very connected with the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, the bands fall a me, which I have mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important, I find that great because it&apos;s worth listening to this music and bands such as Mudhoney make better music than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first, their music was dark, now it is positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album, which may have a somewhat frivolous. But there are also other songs like the end or just breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they have also something positive in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Both the tears came to me, when I heard how she played ed. There are very dark songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when you&apos;re older and something Traumatisches in your life is happening - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - which affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs that embody clearly for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I believe also that you can be a happy person and make still dark music. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects are apart from the disputes about fees with the tender agree. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban call for proposals of the 16 goals opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Mid-1980s, at the height of the now vanished Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration published its libel on the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was compared even to numbers with Central Park of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the demise of the CMB in 1987 in the eyes of many was again to the ceiling of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one (mountain range) and down the few who is spreading in North South direction but upwards (sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> As an example, the Central Park, but Yellowstone no longer served with feral pigs in the role of want bärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> It was as far as the city spent a huge tender, consisting of 16 contests for more access gates to Collserola in September. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> No doubt a goal refers to the concept of a park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Is it so or someone intends to ask gates to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The tender is the topic of conversation in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona not only from organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It&apos;s almost a rekurrentes theme, two members of this old-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can access the back. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And exactly this fact provides the fabric for one of the rare matches between the three architects from Barcelona about thinking, and some university professors who have applied to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldan &quot;it is necessary&quot; to speak, after the attack on the coast of the &quot;front of the mountains&quot; as far as the discourse by Ildefons Cerdà, who about the Green apples, not held has been. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;It should be the principle, that Barcelona&apos;s biggest Park is the beach.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> &quot;Collserola is complex,&quot; says the architect, for the title of &quot;Gates of Collserola&quot; carries a &quot;lexical trap&quot; in itself: man should they not &quot;as access to a park imagine, rather than containment of areas on which we must act.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, such as Roldan and Bayona with urban experience, considered an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; that is &quot;some hazards&quot; in the proposal. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Driven as a result of the &quot;insecurity, which nowadays entails the design of public space&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, which had her &quot;Swan Song&quot; in the section of the Forum. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is their own limit on what can be built on. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;Something to restrict means always, to set the next step&quot;, i.e. to him exceed. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We must consider new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the plan of General Metropolitano (PGM)] may lead to a real disaster.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that there already are a study of the patronage de Collserola, not &quot;should launch on deaf ears&quot;, although he was grateful to the City Council that she gave the possibility of his body, on this project &quot;from the first moment&quot; to participate. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition, he noted that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the document that allows the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his &quot;doubt&quot;, whether this technical profile the multidisciplinary teams launched (&quot;just right&quot;, he says) should guide &quot;We should be just a tool architects.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona seems to indicate that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola lacking: &quot;It 16 contests in cross-section were advertised&quot;, he says, &quot;on the axis of mountain sea.&quot; &quot;But there are no longitudinal perspective that considers the territory in its entirety.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has led at least in his case that he participates in the 16 contests. </seg>

<seg id="2221"> After 72 days silence liberated the agents of Casino red the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey by the process, running against him for alleged extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Manuel Jonas Larrazabal is released after 72 days of captivity, after the agents of Casino red him before the second Criminal Court of the district, which has awarded the process against the brother blackmail leads the Mayor of Monterrey because. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the assassination of the Casino Royale released Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of the Casino red, a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas is seen, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money, so that the City Council approved the secret operation of the betting house. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> According to the criminal complaint, the public prosecutor&apos;s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Mayor of panistischen, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 it en Delitos Patrimoniales he was brought the capital in the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had discarded the offences because of corruption and organised crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19 October he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he presumed to be the owner of the Casino red with one and a half million pesos had bribed. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the central security wing because of death threats against him. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him to the court case as an inmate of the urban prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to take part. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On October 25 he was the Secretary of the second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Yáñez, delivered to a prison regulation. He noted that after the nearly two-month investigation would sufficient evidence be made, guilty to speak Jonas for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house, to open this in return. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday asked the agents of Casino red, Victor Aldo García Gómez the judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the Mayor the punishment to adopt, which is why it is used in the next few hours free. </seg>

<seg id="2236"> The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome announces details of the aircraft accident, in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of communications and transportation in Mexico) informed that the findings of the accident in which were the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly against the ground is bounced without that the pilot would have to initiate an emergency landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that the pilot before the start would have confirmed, the weather conditions were suitable for flight. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &quot;The fact that contact with trees had the propeller blades 25 M above sea level, where the helicopter lost the body, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> He also stated that the helicopter for 19 passengers was built which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the field, on which the machine was run down. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &quot;Find no aircraft parts at other locations were found, the surcharge covered the entire structure.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The area is in a skew from 7 to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> Currently it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, maybe even a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> In turn assured Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that was flown in the helicopter by the Estado Mayor Presidencial at impact with cruising speed and the aircraft on a soft slope fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &quot;This information strengthens the assumption that it was at the time of impact a normal flight operation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference the Director listed the SCT, Perez Jacome, six relevant points should be taken into account in the investigation: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Visual: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In accordance with the standards of the flight there was a flight according to the rules of Sichtflugs. This means that the crew would have had sufficient view in-flight and on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The JUÁREZ recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the Weiterflugs in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some deep hanging clouds moved on. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is possible that the team due to the clouds had selected a lower area with a better view in the direction of the Cuernavaca Valley. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Point of impact: </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Match the impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter. May be it has before impact neither a loss of control of the aircraft still a deviation from the flight path given. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information available to date indicate that the helicopter from the straight and lateral direction was bounced. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of the scattered remains of the aircraft indicate that the helicopter was bounced with its intact structure on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No evidence of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Offer the remains of the aircraft at the accident site indicate neither fire nor explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The recent findings point to several ground contacts. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Investigations on the ground, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is gentle and has a skew of seven to thirty degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the sequence where the helicopter is probably gone to break. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Some information indicate that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a minute search on an area that went beyond the fenced-off area at the accident site, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, what the adoption of strengthened, that the intact aircraft structure against the ground was bounced. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> She heads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists of IPN Mexico&apos;s Social Security Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Administration) announced that it leads a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title &quot;Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence&quot;, are to be used to found the genetic marker related to obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquimica (Department of medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of built from doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of the post graduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sport facilities of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8: 00 A.m. tests are performed with children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the West of the State of Mexico) started and will continue since 8 October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the East of the State of Mexico). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the goal of 500 to 600 is reached investigation personnel, the study on the sports field of Independencia (in the South of the capital district) is continued and of Morelos (in the North of the capital district) completed on the. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He stated that the purpose of the study was getting to know the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youth for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of world day of diabetes said he will aim that three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill out food-related questionnaires. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Also questions them about their physical activity and their familial history of the disease, to control risk factors which might cause diabetes or renal failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He carried out also that on these Saturdays the examination persons measured (weight, size, waist size), controlled their blood pressure and blood values, such as the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (try the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood) determines would. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz Lopez emphasized that this study be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain in young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;The health interview surveys showed from 1999 and 2006 that the proportion of obese boys by 77 percent and the the girl with obesity by 47 percent have increased in almost six years.&quot; &quot;Also the obesity has increased dramatically&quot;, the specialist of the IMSS is stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He indicated that the search for genetic markers is justified, because the genetic history of the population of Mexico is differences of other peoples. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) on average 65 percent Indian American, European and 5% African American is 30%, which reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity related. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> In General, he said the genetics of obesity expresses in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that this will be stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers said immediate benefits for participants in the investigation would be a comprehensive survey of children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It would studied even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (Acanthosis) that indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All the information would be confidential and notified the parents in writing by doctors. The doctors tell parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes them that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz Lopez stated that there were three basic factors which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that means missing movement in everyday life, to spend most of the day watching TV and using means of transport, to go instead of short distances on foot. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> High calorie intake, that is to say, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high-fat and protein, and genetics, which should be analyzed in this research project. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM developed modified Asphalte with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature changes </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Would the attention on the characters that emanate from the road surface, it would be unnecessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana erupts del Valle de México (part of Mexico Valley), said Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured, that when laying out and maintenance of asphalt covering adequately happen, the number of potholes are significantly reduced or even completely avoided. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture &quot;Potholes from a technical perspective&quot; which he delivered on the occasion of the international year of chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, develop modified Asphalte with polymers, to establish a mix similar to the asphalt that, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at high as well as at low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Najera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, as for example, in some cities in the North of the country, should be used to improve the behavior of pavements and thus avoiding the appearance of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon of the part of a high molecular weight has - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of a low - the so-called Malthene. Together, they impart the road surface its characteristic visco-elastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Tough-elastic behavior of asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C like a liquid, at 120 ° C it is very viscous and almost fixed at 50 ° C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> The chemical engineer carried out &quot;Which means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes in a day,&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researchers of the FQ noticed the streets of Mexico City have a flexible road surface, which are drawn from six layers of material, of which the last three asphalt included majority. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> A wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, bathed in asphalt and then paved stones lie between the top layers. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each individual stones this wearing course had been bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles move out and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &quot;If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better&quot;, said the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &quot;About the wear layer&quot;, he carried out &quot;A last layer is designed, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. made of sand, which was bathed in asphalt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Because this layer in contact with the tyres, they need a higher mechanical strength than the wear layer, and she must make friction. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> That this road surface receives the most forces and distributed, the base layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made, must be maintained are. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> &quot;Weather conditions, especially humidity, and temperature fluctuations, are more important to consider factors, above all the water,&quot; said he, &quot;because it substantially affect the behavior of the wearing course.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the terrain is humid, water penetrates into the layer and comes out just trying again. This causes a softening of all layers of pavements and as a result the appearance of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> &quot;If a pothole&quot;, he said, &quot;The surface is worn off first, while the wear layer is affected then.&quot; &quot;But the damage occurs immediately, but is a process that should be maintained at the first sign by appropriate maintenance programmes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The Member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of pavements always in relation to the vehicle load must be, and it must be ensured that to avoid by frequent potholes this rule is respected. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research wait could, for example, of asphalt emulsions, which are in other countries already on the market, and that repair the potholes easily and without applying high temperatures did. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What lacked del Valle of the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that is worked out that Melina Ramirez Serna not got the Crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle receives his 14 missions title. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Once again, Valle del Cauca went up empty in the granting of the Crown for Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied that, to stand to make a silver Crown and the band, that indicates that it as new Miss Colombia, on the winners podium. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> This night received resulting in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico took the Crown and the Cedar itself, the Department already on 14 mission title comes and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had kept the Crown almost in the hands. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question facing many today, is: what was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result is the decline of a great favourite, which had shown that she had everything, to be the new Miss Colombia at every screening. Not for nothing she had been elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles, who received also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the Crown of Miss Colombia with home. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor is as crucial for the decision of the jury, to appoint them, the first Miss is that they the answer to the question &quot;What book you most strongly influenced and why?&quot;, which was been put by Martin Murillo Gomez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, had not convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the honourable Member: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot, I believe pretty much in the literature, I think, it&apos;s a way to civilize themselves, ultimately I think that the book that most influenced my childhood, &apos; Der kleine Prinz&quot; is a very deep depth book. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Currently, I read &apos;Crime and punishment&apos;. It is a book of universal culture which we all should read. I read just a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is &apos;Passions&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that met with little favour, firstly &apos;civilize themselves because of the term&apos; and secondly, because it had not specifically stated how each book mentioned by her had influenced them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after the ceremony Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: &quot;the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the people: read please a bit &apos; the little Prince &apos;. It is a great book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota indicated that in advance all prices had gotten the fact that she was the preferred, which boasts all the Beifälle and the (gastronomy competition Oster, public vote on the best ink tailor-made costume and Reina Madre), &quot;The other candidates jealous had made, what stresste the Queen could not therefore shining on stage.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And we realized that at its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators at the coronation ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although she certainly appeared on both, but the strength and the impetus which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico were on display was her. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;Como en casa&quot; at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, &quot;shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition, eventually but not Queen&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Also, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> A further theory is that Valle could convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, what ultimately is the essence of national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It will have his reason, that two days before the collection of the international jury of Lucy Doughty said they searched for a woman who is committed to the Social Affairs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;Beauty alone not sufficient for a Miss Colombia.&quot; &quot;One must look beyond the physical and concentrate on the social feeling, sure that she had worked with before taking part in the competition on projects,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derrière and the fibrosis, you noted it in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as candidate for &apos;natural beauty&apos; with a healthy body, good eating habits, and good physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernan Orozco, admits that Melina was not the best body that there is better, &quot;but their problem with the fibrosis on the belly for me frankly hard to notice it was pushed their score on the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos by the magazine of Cromos of view is, the surgical interference, where she had undergone had been the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how she it right should be.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2338"> &quot;Her body has never been their strong side, and she had to pay this point.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Due to this award, first awarded by the national beauty contest, a cruel prediction that should be true in the night was built after the appearance in a bathing suit. There was rumour that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, they come in the the Crown to make. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> No matter, whether that&apos;s true or not, the fact is that Melina is from today the year of her rule, although not as a Queen, but as a Princess, on appointment of national beauty contest of Colombia at one of the international competitions to represent a position that offers her the opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, she will go down as one of the Queens, despite their overwhelming presence for Cartagena, the Crown had escaped in the history. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So was the work of the physician who identified the body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A Lophoskopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> These officials work plays a key role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On November 4 a Lophoskopist of investigation unit of the public prosecutor&apos;s Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), entered into: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; through comparison of fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the Department of CTI, Eliazar Gonzalez had on call, a man from Puerto Tejada, who works with 21 years with criminal investigation this week. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in communities of Chocó, where he often five days had to go into the jungle, to reach the place, where the bodies were, that he should identify. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> 2000 he relocated to Valle and after the completion of the required courses he specialized in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. of the palms and soles. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was pointed out to pack clothes for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big awaited him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night, he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that suspicion was that one could be that of the man of who had initiated the oldest guerrilla of the world. That is why he should take the ten-finger print page by Guillermo Leon Saenz (his actual name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But reaching the place with the Untersuchungste, where the body was, he could not identify him due to his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not in the least. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wearing no glasses and was much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the dead body with those on the imprint page. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He had seen correctly: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Still same night this from Puerto Tejada, man that was responsible to inform the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzon, that actually was the Chief of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> On search </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen of the SIJIN in Cali was evaluating to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the fight against &quot;Cano&quot; which was very important. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The fingerprint data is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten identify not only bodies, support also investigation in murder and rape cases, and confirm the identity of the arrested person. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> During their arrest, many offenders present false identification documents or they have none. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take the fingerprints them and check them in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researchers told us that he had to tear a piece of wall of a house in a theft, because the thief had relied on precisely at this point with his hand, as he pulled out a safe crowded with jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &quot;Walls are difficult, because their surfaces for fingerprinting are inappropriate.&quot; He recalled, &quot;but in this case we take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in several robberies&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Using the fingerprint also murder suspects can be relieved or charged. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently one death was surrounded by brandy bottles found. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> In the calculation, it has been suggested that a member of the family could be tatverdächtig, and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, so he is associated with the place where the crime was committed. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that &quot;the fingerprints with physical or chemical reagents of the object would be taken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If they appear, a planting trowel or a tape is used to carry. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Then the prints on the Asif will be sent, which is the criminal database, or to the personal level Office. </seg>

<seg id="2406"> The GDP is growing at 1.5% thanks to the consumption of domestic and stopped the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed that was still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which culminated in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster, the Japan 2 had experienced during World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> The first estimates of the Government in Tokyo evaluated the damage at 300 000 $, a blow that seems to be despite the difficult global economic situation, to weaken. </seg>

<seg id="2410"> The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the fiscal year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The recovery can be explained partly by the sale of machine for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% as compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> Nevertheless, the actual reversal of the Japanese economy not only from keynsianischen impulses that take advantage of the crisis to build infrastructure or to build is based. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Japan is woken up in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable is increased by 1%, pushed by the growing spending on cars, travel and leisure. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> The stigma of the yen </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - resting in one of the &quot;refuge currencies&quot; of investors, who are fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the US, a privilege, the as a gravestone on the accounts of the exporters. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> With a harder currency, the products more expensive abroad are a serious problem for a country whose Wirtschaft is based on the health of large technology producers. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Toyota and Sony for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> While the markets continue besieged peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant. </seg>

<seg id="2430"> The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek Government is a response to pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine belief of political forces, is slowly consumed by facts. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday, that there is no alternative to the reforms and that the hundred days agreed to his appointment were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader assured Nueva Democracia, Antonis of Samaras, that he support the new austerity measures and by no means its call new elections to the conservative party intended date, 19 February, will take back. </seg>

<seg id="2435"> The Conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million, which badly needs Athens. He made it clear that he would approve no commitment on compliance with the cost-cutting measures. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> But the European Commission, that referendum is still irritated because of the effects of poker play with Papandreu, reaffirmed yesterday again, their request was not to shake: the economic aid would not be signed, if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties &quot;a clear written agreement as soon as possible&quot; would sign. </seg>

She was convinced that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that this kind of business would be &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to reach up to the year 2015 Millennium objectives by the United Nations and &quot;In particular the objective, the number of persons, which must, live with income of less than a dollar a day so below the&quot;poverty line&quot;.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Spain &quot;continue working&quot; on the expansion of Begünstigtennetzes &quot;in the last corner of the world and it this task performs responsibly&quot;, noticed the Queen Sofia, which hopes that the initiatives and contributions, which are emanating from the Summit that lasts until Thursday, &quot;creating new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women&quot; as the main beneficiary of these loans are guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> &quot;We have seen many successes&quot; and &quot;face many challenges.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The Summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to kick-off &quot;two fundamental objectives&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> The Queen stated that it will strive that up against the end of the year 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will rise above the poverty line. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> The concept of microcredit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the by Muhammad Yunus &quot;Way initiated years ago&quot;, which assesses the Queen Sofia as an &quot;Act of Justice and recognition&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2452"> &quot;Ethical imperative&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2453"> The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez pointed out that solidarity is an &quot;ethical imperative&quot; for the entire democratic State. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> In this sense she stressed that it is a mistake to link development aid in times of economic boom because there had been a &quot;lasting commitment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Jimenez was of the opinion that the micro-credit is a &quot;Serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty was&quot;, and that the Governments of the industrialized countries would have to work now &quot;more than ever&quot; according to solidarity criteria, and not likely to admit that the solidarity of the crisis the victim falls. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> For Spain, the micro-credit are one of the &quot;most important forms of development aid&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> The Secretary of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, beklatschte &quot;success&quot;, &quot;marginalized&quot; people to give &quot;you will always be closed doors&quot; &quot;Hope&quot; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city, that open &quot;Their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of General voting </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, the November 14 in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulty.) </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was originally not in the program, but has prevailed in the autumn, to provide enough especially to those activists who today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax appreciate the Government policy with regard to the Greeks. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The presidential resolution proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> However, only nine had voted among 1001 delegates, ten had abstain. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The several minutes lasting standing ovation that initially, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble were as a result of their intervention orders, trial on the part of the three Europe inclined to Finance Minister no doubt open. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main idea of the Chancellor has - as well as the request - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot;not less but more Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &quot;Nine million jobs directly from the euro are dependent on&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> The Chancellor is &quot;the time for a breakthrough in Europe come for&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, bestärkende the control of the European Union; &quot;&quot;as this could result but in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of General voting&quot;, to give Europe a face&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> However, this is definitely one of the application proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble stood Godfather. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Surely, it is hardly likely that the 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Groβ Britain is opposed faces the thing, and the Chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The milestone is however. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> As well, the delegates in an overwhelming majority have rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country on the ECB Executive Board according to the weight of the individual economies which obviously would be a strengthening of the position of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> The Chancellor roofed to calm the climate within their party has reinforced thus the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She no longer tried their Congress at the expense of the &quot;small&quot; or the difficulties all European countries to win, which would immediately condemn the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> As far as the Europe application dedicated to a paragraph of the significance of &quot;German French friendship&quot;, Angela gets Merkel France not on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not directly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Because this recalls that Leipzig faced two centuries at the heart of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact one of the extremely humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What represents the fraud in sickness? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the family allowances, UMP and Government now take the sickness in attack. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, the November 15 in Bordeaux to consult a family aid Fund and to present a talk on the - since 2007 recurring - theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the State. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> To accompany this attack, which originates from an effort to take the economy in a sample of hardness, on the other hand however no less Harbinger an axis of the right presidential campaign represents, wants the majority focus on employee ill message. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First of all with budget-economic objectives: the Government aims at the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a notification for workers in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In good German, this means that a diseased workers without approval of the specific company would lose the reward of four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A measure that according to the daily &quot;Les Echos&quot; anger threatens to provoke, but would help to introduce EUR 280 million. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And which would go hand in hand with a different measure of rather symbolic character: the State officials a unvergüteten Karenztag in case of illness to grant (so far there are for them, in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, no waiting period). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these questions in the discussion are available, the majority of new reignited the fraud issue, which this time is targeted at abuse associated with work absence. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &quot;Checks will be far more important, and in addition they are to pay back, when it is required,&quot; Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday that the November 13 before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> The impact of this message in terms of the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness a little disproportionate seem as also in other cases. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is subject to permanent monitoring, as well as political offensives that have most frequently borne fruit in fact since 2002. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are no longer frequent sick than people elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Stay but first in the nationwide figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the national health insurance by CNAM, more than 237 million euros daily payments were disbursed in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Pursuant of the institutes and documentation Institute of health presented the daily payments in 2008 with €11.3 billion 5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount fell 46% regarding maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% on disease breaks, which is 6.2 billion euro. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And thus 2.5% of health care expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010 were the French against the 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days allowed. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average value which glossed over some differences: another, was published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning, site, revealed that 75% of the 40 000 stated surveyed, French workers, to have taken a single sick day. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> An other, covered by health insurance, this time study makes it clear that 37% of sickness were in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> French workers tend no longer than elsewhere compared to their European neighbours to incapacity for work. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French National Centre for scientific research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absences (disease or otherwise justified) reciprocated, at France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud in sickness represents a vanishingly small proportion with regard to undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Here only a weak dimensions is achieved with regard to fraud. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatische controls on sickness, exceeding 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> &quot;&quot; In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) established under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 of realised, short-term sickness, which were heiβt in 37.050 cases &quot;, unjustified or too long&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> The systematically controlled ill message cases more than 45 days, there were duration under 1.2 million 11% on &quot;maladaptive or unjustified&quot; cases, that is 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Overall, this makes so 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases on several million workers who have claimed a notification. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A digit that represents only a weak dimensions compared to, for example, those of undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP deputies Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July with regard to this issue, between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax profit loss per year constitutes, i.e. more than the cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the Defraudation in the latter. </seg>

<seg id="2691"> The choice in Berlin will be in the form of an increase of the price of electricity, an energetic dependence reinforced by the increased use of imported gas in particular Russia, an increase of gas and coal-fired plants caused CO2 emissions put down. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> All these unpleasant effects will manifest itself already within a few months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark gives rise to thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is on the one hand European League leaders with regard to wind energy, from which it applies 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country of one of the largest user of coal and gas is alternately used with wind energy; aufgrunddessen are its CO2 emissions, as well as its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the resistance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a higher in contrast to our French households by 40% electricity bill. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Because the price of energy in the globalised economy represents a key role in the competitiveness, as well as a pledge of stability the industry on national soil, the French companies on the basis of the cheapest electricity in Europe have an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Any significant reduction in nuclear power would entail therefore a strong increase in the price of energy, what would become the noble statements about the Reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of illusion. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveys showed that that was a price, the vast majority of French people is willing to pay as little, as opposition to the principle of this energy source they suggests. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> We remember that the energy policy of our country has allowed to establish an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Due to their strong export nature brings you a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on international markets, making these creators of countless jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> France should take the decision to abandon nuclear power, the a majority of these SMEs victim would fall, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital and nuclear export would shrink together more and more. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> What electricians would instruct an EPR designed to work on sixty years if the decline of his producers is inevitable? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is a magic bullet for the generation of electricity work of the nor one like a devil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Developed by the company Areva, -carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> An absolute imperative is to maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have a safety authority carried out by uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as in the construction in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Their teams that have made a name for itself due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security presentation. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> 50 Years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only a single one in three mile Iceland, under normal operating conditions occurred; so he proceeded without consequences for man and the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> Chernobyl, the drama has been invoked by reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human failure. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented disasters which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will pull their lessons as well from this accident, as she had done after the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As the fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design which allows him resistance to such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Because under the contractors as desirable, considers it to build a nuclear power plant, a construction in Flamanville would a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, by it could be them free reign, to seize the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is inevitable and legitimate to search for the best arrangement of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, determines the as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overload by police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy that subjected the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a &quot;country of human rights&quot;, as France even had dubbed himself. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently the harassment directed against foreign students from official site had coined the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior had casually (see liberation of May 23) announced that France &quot;need have no talents, bricklayer or waiter from abroad&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> On this subject, there is namely a far-reaching consensus between right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> By right the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, 1976 had declared that &quot;900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country are likely to constitute&apos;, from left side by Michel Rocard, who had outlined in 1990, France&quot;could take not the overall poverty of the world&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is in the degree of Groβzügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of invasion of the national soil through hordes of Polish plumber was split in 2005, both right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French company have been perceived by both camps. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the degree of Groβzügigkeit you to admit the immigrants against is willing. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> François hollande is confined in its programme to banalities that indicate, co-development allow to solve our &quot;migration problems&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a last, as a problem, can possibly affect the elections; However, it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron economists in a recent work, remember, that summarizes the latest findings regarding the Immigration (exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), a broad consensus with regard to the positive impact of the immigrant flood on growth, wages and jobs in the immigration exists among the specialists. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> To restrict immigration, growth would undermine and harm the labour market situation. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The concerns over the influence of migrants are based on the, to substitute by they exerted pressure on their wages idea that they threaten, the local workers, especially the less qualified. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> However, experience has shown that immigrants in fact are significantly complementary than than the local wage laborers because they perform schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that are under terms of employment. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that slightly irritate local wage laborers, the more qualified among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which training is in line not the job. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive effect of wage </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as a surgeon would have difficulty to work where an anesthesiologist shortage, so this complementarity between locals and migrants causes a positive effect of immigrant immigration on wages and national labour market situation in a country. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni peri has in this way and manner calculated that a 1% increase in the immigrant flood do cause miteinbezogene, long-term increase of in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants is conducive of idea creation and economic growth (high percentage of naturalized immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners;) (Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants contribute also net to social systems, in European countries on average approximately at an altitude of 1% of the overall budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> For example, the International Labour Organisation estimates that someone wandering in the age of 30 after Germany is a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) to the 150,000 euros the public budget on average over his lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate to bring the missing points of intersection &quot;with teeth&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These aforementioned teeth which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy, now remains to consider European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate commodity. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be even can remember, who had the entire 20th century about the tragedies of World War I, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the Gulag, but also Franco&apos;s in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece about themselves after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago fare. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some had probably believed it rich, to exercise the right to vote, and on direktest possible manner to democracy a triumph over their enemies for all to see. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Since Napoleon &quot;miniature&quot;, we know that it was a characteristic of the attitude. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, which is necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient condition and can be just as well to the &quot;repressive instrument&quot;, as at the time the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is first and foremost and as much political and democratic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> In this respect, the change of attitude of the Greek true false referendum had twice revealing character: once the the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the unsettling feeling of their impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be considered obsolete. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least the target most of them, no longer in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain, to push to a success of the national referendum which was organized according to the needs and in reverse order. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free ticket for the European tyrant or a jump blindfolded into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: A great choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, in full right, have shed off and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There are no crises in Greece, Italy, you know Spain and Portugal - in addition not been, where the list to stop - because it is only a single crisis, and it is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is all over Europe, which bends the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from his impotence and his lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is all over Europe, which is humiliated at the international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe — this is the throughout Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and each of it affiliated Nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgent need is to give the leadership of the European project of popular sovereignty back to the hand. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is situated at all whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, make free from the markets, and to initiate a future investment. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition, which can be taken without total democratic church without certainly lead us to destruction. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal was opposed by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, long time, everyone today urges the European economic governance to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Agree. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But one would be without political integration and a stronger democracy - how she see the citizens - to imagine this, folly and a more dead end again. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We need to make a new stage in European construction on us. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To make France arise the Republic, it took the fact that establishing &quot;Republicans&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of the interests alone could not enough do. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This information is still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We need to make a better integrated economic Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be achieved by a politically seen more democratic Europe creates, a genuine European sovereignty of the people. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> We need Europeans to make Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards become the common property </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The world fair for chip cards opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in a more optimistic attitude. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 should according to Eurosmart actually with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (debit cards, SIM cards phone) end with more than 6 billion units sold. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The tragendste segment is the contactless technology which enables payments in public transport or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Compared to the one year previously 320 million sold should this year 460 million contactless smart cards sold worldwide are! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Their market share should further increase (580 million units expected) in 2012 and represent about 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards). </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after it for a long time is lagged behind the Asia Pacific region. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France are the beginnings of rather modest: only 400,000 contactless Visa cards were distributed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> However, the consumer markets make steam. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards so this year. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> To go to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &quot;Two major French financial institutions have committed systematically deliver their customers bank cards, which are equipped with contactless chips&quot;, Gerard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France Announces. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test payment by mobile phone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> This is only a first step on the way to the cash of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> A vanishingly small percentage of devices has been equipped with the necessary to conduct these transactions NFC technology (near field communication). </seg>
<seg id="2788"> &quot;You have come in default&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> &quot;But at least next year, they should experience a real upward trend.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2790"> &quot;We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> But the banks take initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> The Crédit Agricole had yesterday announced the launch of a test run in Caen, will expire by December to next June. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The iPhone&apos;s some 200 customers and staff are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. </seg>

<seg id="2797"> Paris is very concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> Long under suspicion relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> On Sunday, Algerian Deputy had Abdelkader Messahel itself had confirmed that Algiers &quot;had become certainty now about&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> He said &quot;how to proceed with the two organizations, as well as the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation&quot;, without going further into the details. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to make a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation of the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in last January have promoted interfaces for days. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi of kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should have been on the following day at the same time as several of their captors during an operation carried out by the French special forces getöten. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips in the rubble at the site, which belonged to the terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Terrorist axis </seg>
<seg id="2806"> The analysis of the listed phone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France International (RFI) investigators interested in in particular the numbers two interlocutors: numbers leads to a Nigerian, who himself had; stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in Northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram the other leads to a man, as the Aqmi and the sect close below applies. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &quot;This is a step forward, one must wait however undoubtedly clearer evidence before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko harem&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> &quot;It is however conceivable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2810"> The Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo softens from &quot;Man white for years, that the sect concerns financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it shows increasingly active&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> In these last few months, these &quot;benefits&quot; have become always obvious during its course, as well as the speeches and the modes of operation of Boko harem, which now consult of suicide bombers, as well as the use of always more complex explosives indicate, which bear the same signature as the ones that were used by Aqmi. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The international community, to begin in Washington, has exerted pressure since then to Abuja, so that one there takes into consideration the problems caused by Boko Haram. </seg>

<seg id="2818"> First, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in the line of fire. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> 2009, the activists of Boko Haram with their increased attacks against the morgues were particularly active. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> But as usually in differentiated is a reaction on the part of Abuja. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> The army surrounded the city, it is one of 800 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, in captivity was killed in prison. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> So listening to the Republican presidential candidate, voters could get nearly this impression. </seg>

<seg id="2844"> &quot;Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Also has he promised increased military aid Israel and Obama accused still guilty this partners against commitments. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> The businessman Herman Cain, second placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful ignorance of the file display. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Recently he urged, &quot;try to develop&quot; a nuclear power - and seemed except eight while the fact the Chinese military threat to give, since Beijing against admitting that China is already since 1964 in the possession of military nuclear weapons! </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The gas pipeline Nord Stream that runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe connects directly with Russia, was put into operation. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> She will provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and circumstance. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> About 500 invited guests, including four heads of State and Government, stream have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under the orchestral sound reinforcement and gourmet buffet of the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord, which directly connects Russia and Germany under the sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> German Chancellor Angelica Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart have mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together behind the wheel of the valve upside down, which promoted the Russian gas into the Western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With the new gas pipeline 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year should be delivered by a first pipeline 1.224 km long, connecting the region St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - to be completed end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And you can already sound to the eventuality of the construction of a third pipe on your own route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this enormous building looks like a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream pipeline will a direct gas allow namely after Germany, and by avoiding any Trassenverlaufs by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For this reason, these two countries lose their power a little: for them, it is now harder to exert pressure on Russia by them threaten to close access to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was spared back not afraid to compare the &quot;Nord Stream&quot; pipeline with a &quot;new German Soviet Pact&quot; in connection to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the subject of politically äuβerst is sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has gained a greater security of supply through the assertion of this Russian project. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> This is however at the expense of an exposure of European energy, because the project has taken a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia it done brought in barely five years, his vision of a direct Alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong Gasverbrauche and whose gas reserves running out, go to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,&quot; François Fillon confirmed at the opening of the gas pipeline by he pointed out to what extent the vast gas contracts also from political and economic side are important. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this explains the broad smile of the numerous represented in Lubmin Gazprom Manager with regard to the gas line. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The underwater cable is made of steel with concrete coating to protect them from ship anchors. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> You resting on the ocean floor about 200 metres in depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> In its construction had to be dodged war FP4 minefields. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;About hundreds of mines had to just in case be removed or destroyed&quot;, stated Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> There had to be taken enhanced measures for the protection of fauna and flora. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The line is a long line of metal, hard as 242 Eiffel, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, even maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project took distance from, since the Sweden little on it were eager to see in a permanent way to level its coastline settle a Russian State company. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &quot;In the event of an accident we close the gas flow in less than a minute&quot;, explained Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak that escapes itself in the gas pipeline owned gas so into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> This case is considered but probably by design engineers little, because the Schweiβnähte was estimated to be a resistance of a leak per 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The State monitoring of gas transmission is both guaranteed by an underwater robot, which controlled for external observation purposes of a seagoing ship out is as also from a device that circulates inside the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It has the shape of a cigar, miβt a meter in diameter, is introduced into the Interior of the pipe and moving through the gas pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three full days of locomotion through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device on his arrival provides most accurate details of the possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas pipeline is designed for fifty years to work, without even the slightest repair must be subjected to. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> Quite simply, the gas circulation is ensured by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This is 200 bar at the entry, 100 bar at the exit site. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have combined their forces to the realisation of this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> However, the wiring remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Still, the German companies of E. ON and BASF are affiliated (according to 15.5%), here as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (according to 9%). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have formed a business community, called Nord Stream and which is entrusted with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It has its registered office in Zug in the Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom has rented then the entire capacity of its gas transport company, on twenty-year renewable contract. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &quot;Gazprom will pay for the capacity, no matter how much the real transport fails volume of gas&quot;, explained Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was secured 30% of shareholders, as well as to 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total labour cost should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez the investment was for example, 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> The minority shareholders are however gewiβ to recoup their expenses, because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas pipeline is a sandy, pine-forested coastline at Lubmin Baltic revealed. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The 4.5-meter valves form the gas exit gate. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure pressure, temperature, and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded in the German gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, this Terminal with a million m3 of Russian gas passes hour is supplied. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012 would be this. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine, a brand book. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> About fifteen years ago in life launched by an Italian company, Moleskine would like to give now new style writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has an air of adventure, by candlelight with writing spent hours. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The notebook from Moleskine is easily recognizable with his black, rectangular cover, his rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen pages, as over time towards aged. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today originated however in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to take a distinguiertes design notebook on the market at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, at that time the expert advisor of the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook was from a traditional production technology, called mole (Mole skin) skin inspired, which refers to a Baumwollack, which is used, for example, for covers of upholstered benches. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This kind of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &quot;Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten item, which until the 20th century avant-garde artist was an icon&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi, now Markenverantwortliche in modo modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success occurs. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Increase sales by 26% between 2006 and 2010 and establish itself with a paragraph of 12.7 million. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> This is far from the usual production of the first year where only 3,000 notebooks are designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine crossed the Italian border and runs in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to make an identikit of the buyer, since the notebook inspires as well as business people such as students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open geistiger customers. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company which had 12 employees in its infancy, employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as FNAC, in small boutiques in the city centres and sees itself out to enforce his identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &quot;We have followed the spirit of the times and his new Schreibbedarf, which despite the recovery of emails&quot;, said Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exposition called &quot;detour (detour)&quot; in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, the company on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno also brought a cover with Leopard print on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood it to diversify its products: bags, schedule, filler, machine hull... The brand is in the whole range of articles. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success, the envy brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the SG capital Europe, the current Syntegra capital investment fund, and set up so that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why is the unemployment rate handicapped person at such a high level? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today begins the &quot;15th week of work for people with disabilities&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average mean value: 19% against 9% unemployment of the population as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Disheartening? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &quot;No, so Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association adapt that aligns the&quot;week of work for people with disabilities&quot;stressed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &quot;The progress achieved fifteen years are substantial.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &quot;At that time the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &quot;Nevertheless enormously much remains to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said, however, that for the disabled unemployed still many obstacles continue, before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> More often it is true the older ones: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> Have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no high school diploma, and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities among the 2.3 million students with higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% in the total section. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, there are so many criteria which make a renewed work quickly, and which &quot;Form the core of the problem&quot;, Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, is an association founded in 1992, the company help, hampered the to recruit workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much for the factual brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remains unspoken, the attitudes which although of course, but still slowly evolving. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> A study conducted in April by the IMS Entreprendre Association for the magazine La Cité stated, the managers surveyed have &quot;a weak level knowledge with regard to people with disabilities&quot;, which is &quot;over-represented&quot; &quot;of persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually Minderbemittelten&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result is that private companies have still a long way to go with more than 20 employees in order to achieve the employment target of 6% handicapped workers, which was enshrined in a law of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> These latter, directed 2008 figures refer to a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &quot;We are now at around 3%&quot; reported to collect contributions from companies Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization that is responsible, which flout this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof: Number operations &quot;be paid fees&quot; has as well as the sum of the paid amounts between 2007 and 2011 decreased, namely zahlenmäβig from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &quot;The Act of 2005, which provides for contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, declared Pierre Blanc.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &quot;But this improvement also expresses a genuine knowledge particularly in the large groups.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of labour, deal with only 59% of the premises between 20 and 49 employees disabled people in work, companies with 100 to 199 employees, however, 82%. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &quot;What good fortune&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Already before them the &quot;Eden had not concealed hazard and Georges Leekens her pleasure that brought them the friendly blue Tuesday (20: 45) offered forehead.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It would be picked up too far, to claim there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Sitting side by side on the podium the audience of the Stade de France George Leekens and Eden had can make good and like to hazard peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the spirited gesture of his Angriffsspielers against Turkey the Belgian coach had harvested nothing but praise on his person. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &quot;I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I would like to look forward,&quot; assures the native Liller in turn. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> With regard to the contrast between its representation in Club and national team &quot;a unit, this justifies everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &quot;In Lille I am which is not the case in Belgium throughout the year,&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &quot;It is time for me to go at the start&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Hazard will come to Saint Denis, brought Friday night against Romania in terms of matches against France to finally &quot;to shine&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without however to refrain from the touch of &quot;pleasure&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> He fires at the French national team since the age of 7 years, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &quot;I was always supported&quot;, he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This inevitably helps even more to strengthen the &quot;unique&quot; nature of this encounter. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> So much in advance: &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)-being&quot;, he brings to mind. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &quot;We have started us just over the way.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;Large happiness means to play against them!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Leekens played his part with good nature &quot;The pride&quot; on. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &quot;The pride, a gala match&quot; to play. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &quot;Proud&quot; also - in his capacity as &apos;Neighbours&apos; - to confirm that France &quot;again has become a team at a very high level&quot;, and the little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job&quot; he said enthusiastically. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championship, so the technician sees itself very well the airplane with the blue (the French national team)... and that the direction of Brazil share in the year 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &quot;We small Belgians come out big&quot;, he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;We&apos;re going to plan a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &quot;You&apos;ll notice that at the upcoming games&quot;. The game against France was involved. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal very confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with large optimism 3–2 to Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> In the first leg, the objectivity was missing two teams. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &quot;At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento is already in Poland and the Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that &quot;La semi-finals&quot;, his national team, for which he is responsible since September 2010, 2012 will qualify for the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> For Portugal, this means happiness in fact only 90 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a match to play and serve as an opponent, and Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In the light of Hinspiels (0-0) in Friday the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice still not fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal dominated the game over an hour more than clear, but the team was unable to leave the important mark the thing, which would have increased the pressure from her. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &quot;This is a good result, which, however, carries some risk, because we have scored no away&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> At home however, their bright shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese which are convinced yourself before an audience that should be just as hot on the game to make, even if the lot of course as &quot;very scarce&quot; was announced, the optimistic, but clear Bento said. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &quot;We expect a very tight match, are however completely convinced to be able to gain the upper hand,&quot; said the 42 year old Portuguese coach. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &quot;We have process continue to a 50% chance at the European Championships 2012 to be&quot; qualified but the successor to Carlos Queiroz. </seg>

<seg id="3001"> &quot;We will compete against a team, which has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities&quot;, he added. </seg>
<seg id="3002"> &quot;As already in Zenica the Portuguese had that, already at the beginning on the Bosnians to exert maximum pressure,&quot;them no time to think give to&quot;.&quot; </seg>
