<seg id="111"> Stylista must also be good psychologist, says the profíci </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the initial article on how they learn stylisté, so I am a little postěžovala, this has already been a lot in the early hours. </seg>
<seg id="113"> This is what I netušila what will follow. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lecture three profíků from the field, oblékání problematic figures, as well as seminar on how it is on hold. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will be worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer to the final test, the more information, as well as practical tasks ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> Held every Saturday and Sunday, and even if the rate is really &quot;našlapaný.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we are with the director of the alenkou probíraly in the exchange rate is not the only boy, as pay woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And such is the overwhelming majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone has a short neck, one was chlapeckou figure without pořádných křivek and someone, being overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Stylista procedures must know how zjemnit extend broad shoulders, neck or add the curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got off, as for the wife of Jennifer lopezové, more PRSA and Boky and narrow, stress and, at the same time, the woman neobléknout figure much too vyzývavě passport. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, there is a difference between the passport and Boky that skirts or trousers really out of character, then it makes sense to keep ušít at least one such piece on peace. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly you will not regret it, because it is perfectly padnoucí clothes to nezaplacení. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In skirt on peace, you will feel much better than in the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje odstává those and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Chlapecká character, can afford to wear clothes with řasením applications, výšivkami or nabíráním. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Such information and the types of figures is, of course, a lot, so I am glad that I have a whole week to have all the information on this utřídila in my head. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And fear is that, because it is up to zadanému domestic task. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the kurzistek, received přiřazenou celebritu, which has come up with two outfity: daily and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We must take into account the appearance, the fashionable style of the personality and the type of characters. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will be &quot;dress&quot; mirandu kerrovou, perhaps you know it from Victoria&apos;s Secret campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the spirit of jásám, for me personally, certainly better than that Britney spearsová, Christina Aguilera, which in recent times přibrala perhaps 100 one kilogram of - please take into account nadsázku - or mladinká Selena gomezová. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Oblečky must avoid from magazines or out on the Internet and vytisknout and then graphically process. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, as will the result, says that, as well as our personal style and relationship to grafickému ztvárnění. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Think a graphic side of stylingu is important, too. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Stylista is neobléká just physically, but also creates the product pages in magazines, for example - to a specific project, for example, the trends of handbags, of convenience, etc.. </seg>
<seg id="137"> Tell us about that stylista and návrhář Mario kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But this only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Stylista must have a general overview </seg>
<seg id="140"> Saturday a lecture nabitou information about the kinds of figures zpestřili now three guests from the field. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Stylista John humble, fashion návrhář Jakub polanka and fashion photographer Ben renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and stylista, should be used. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And šikovný stylista can work with one piece of clothing in a variety of ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Variabilita is crucial in this case. </seg>
<seg id="145"> We should be a trenčkot - or if you want trenchcoat initially, it is possible to be standard across the džíny and Triko as cover, but it can pay for the bare body, on the road lodičky and nafotit as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just roll rukávy or límce and now the look is different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &quot;The play a,&quot; stressed about it. </seg>
<seg id="148"> But I most appreciate the following advice: &quot;You need to work perfectly aware of the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &quot;Then you can begin to break,&quot; he said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, it is so clear to me why the drtíme all those propositions, what with the combined, to what, why, when and in fashion magazines Sometimes we see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention the přehlídkách. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the fotografovi benovi, I know that stylista must have prepared a lot more options clothes than they fotit. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So in fashion story, which will have 10 parties, 10 outfitů, I have to be ready to &quot;nastajlovat&quot; at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that looks and works in combination with other pieces at fotce clothes sometimes very different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With that, so we have to create a outfitu count. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and style is doing, sometimes up to half the success we confirmed John humble. </seg>
<seg id="157"> You only have to look at the madonnu image and marketing, which is not a miracle zpěvačkou, but make it a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech republic is still approach to the use of services stylistů rather cold. </seg>
<seg id="159"> As well as familiar faces, it sometimes as unnecessary - just did something that I can, that, as in vypadám is secondary. </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if they are from the US people leave a styling, then we have expected that we nadiktuje likely to completely different - smaller size than it really is. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then left to googlovat and to see whether the tabloid nepsal about the fact that the celebrita ztoustla / zhubla and the like. </seg>
<seg id="162"> John and Mario put us on Sunday to lead the heart, that is not enough stylistovi is in vogue and outfit to cobbled together. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Above all, communicate with people in their work, which also putting on, and so it is important to be a good psychologem. </seg>
<seg id="164"> To estimate the people nepodbízet, the State for his point of view. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &quot;When you objedná any manažerka, it protřídili šatník and added it to fine pieces, so it can not vyházet a skříň and say, for God&apos;s sake, this is the horror.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &apos;find at least a couple of things that pochválíte there and Will you encourage, for what they wear, &quot;says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> It also specifically showed us what it must include a &quot;placovka &apos;, or the Taška on Plac. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is the one zapnete around the passport and you are in possession of all the necessary propriety. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to the clear things, such as the gap, váleček chlupy or zavírací pin factor, there are also silonová thread with it stylista vypomáhá in focení products, such as handbags and hats, special klipsy, which sepneme behind the clothes, if there is a greater špendlík or other svorka are not admissible, destroyed the dress, or šitíčko. </seg>
<seg id="170"> In order to just neposlouchaly, but also something virtually vyzkoušely, we learn, as well podlepit shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> And in the ateliéru where there is equal focení surface, podrážka could harm, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we lepily and lepily. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Nůžkami shoes we must not affect that happens to damage. </seg>
<seg id="174"> Is there a need to really zručnost. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario pleased with me when my creation of the unqualified praise. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The zručnost, is not really my kámoška. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Each this is only a tiny fraction of what we listen on the second a continuation of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Begins to be becoming more and more clear to me that a commitment to stylingu on the professional level is really not a walk in the park, regardless of whether they say who wants what it wants. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In a Need for Speed: the run with Závodí across America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> A review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally a ride is quite unnecessary on sloppy mistakes because of a series of changes in routine morning trip to šichtu. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Ambitions to have, to a large extent, but this is not a valid, when clearly nechtělo anyone to do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The run he appeared before issuing a new deal with the high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Promised that years of Race Series Need for Speed once again take a new direction, and of the hratelných highlights seemed like the game in žánru action involved, which would not only be in number. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious, as will the passages in which the hero will be deployed from and will take place after their cars. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as it is customary for a series of NFS, many is in effect a little differently than we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> It is potentially a decent arkádové, but a whole stretches down a few unnecessary errors, which are more or less in a series of for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So it is that they are not even the mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible laziness of the vývojářů. </seg>
<seg id="189"> Adventure is very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> You are included in the story, which the hero Jack has Some problems of personal character and as a solution offers participation in illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> At the wheel usednete on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is dorazit as it is the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea brings with it some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> Route is divided into 10 stages, and then to more than 50 plants. </seg>
<seg id="194"> The implication is that every race goes on the other line, and the stage is set in various different enough and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> One that does not have a moment, a feeling that it still offered the same game. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Moreover, some of the environment are very nice to see, even though the technical level of works of grafiky corresponds to the previous series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So it is no světoborného. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But ride across the desert landscape, the autumn or in the zasněžených high mountains are vizuálně very pleasantly. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Plants are also from time to time zpestřeny some netypickým element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> IN THE DESERT, for example, přimotáte into sandy storms, which greatly reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> By contrast, in the mountains, you must be careful not to make you nezasypala avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> In addition, they are well behind nasázeny individual race. </seg>
<seg id="203"> While there are only a few types, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> Point, so you předjet the required number of rivals in the essence of the classic race, then, doháníte time - classic battle with the stopkami - and then are waiting for you to be duel with a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> From time to time, even in this připlete, as well as the police, which all your efforts are making. difficult even further </seg>
<seg id="206"> What are those outside the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Rather it is just such an interactive animace, when Jack prchá majority before someone and you must help him so that, in the right moments tisknete right buttons. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complex. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Surprise, however, that these passages in the game is much less than you expect - perhaps even only three in particular. </seg>
<seg id="210"> As a result, but it is a good thing because the element has a chance to become otravným and in the context of this grows, so one of the elements that zpestřují game. </seg>
<seg id="211"> Driving model is following in the footsteps of previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that in this day and age, it is definitely not kdovíco, but one can not say that it would be záporem. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you are looking for from realistic simulating,, you will have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But akčněji pojatému involved driving model suits here still quite well in the competition, although we could find better. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So far, all well and good. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems are starting to emerge after a period of time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to jízdního model, is no longer power in order kolizní model. </seg>
<seg id="218"> From the Games of this type, that we spočítá difficult distortions and collisions, but when in fact to any nárazem into any building you have your car will do, then it is probably the least suspect, as everything in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typically in close předjíždění or míjení cars in normal operation, sometimes only a little olíznete each other, but sometimes in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild piruetách. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even a napadrť. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the restartů system that is not particularly does not matter, but it rozladí you reliably. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Restarty are handled in such a way that if the rozmlátíte or vyjedete far out of line, way back on the last game you a clue on the track. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But only five restartů is available in every race. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When the race vyčerpáte, you have to start again from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So it is that AIDS, in case something goes wrong, rather than that you can explicitly rely on them. </seg>
<seg id="226"> But sometimes even restarty will not help to solve it is to the need to learn the section of the race by heart. </seg>

<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution is that the company viewed as a very current, and yet from its inception, it was 100 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Basis of this dlouhodobosti laid the first chairman of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>

<seg id="481"> As the tour have prices since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> In 1989 in what was then Czechoslovakia was only allowed five of travel agents: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agents at the time, sold only in the most trips to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the West, was very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists travel to leave to the sea in the GDR German Democratic Republic, to the Soviet Union Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea, to Bulgaria, Romania - both to the Black Sea - and in Hungary - Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, then, however, the Yugoslav regime embrace to the west and the way of the Czech tourists in Yugoslavia, have been very limited. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The ultimate irony, socialism was that citizens of the Socialist bloc - i.e. also čechoslovákům - not been allowed to travel individually or as part of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> I would, in the event that Czechoslovakia individual citizen to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, has not been so needed in this country zvací letter or individual way possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Travel agents offering trips to the West, but at the time it was necessary to stand overnight spacákem or have in the front office &quot;well known.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> NOT SO, however, was not vyhráno. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The FX Promise, which was a condition for the trip to the West, was granted a &quot;politically nespolehlivým people&quot; who could not travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Czechoslovakia&apos;s currency is not freely směnitelnou currency without any exchange promise has not been able to obtain financial resources - Western currency - on the road to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> By far the most often, however, the Czechs take holidays at home, which were a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs pořizovali and this custom survives to this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> Travel since 1989, the Czechs and experienced a real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Whereas in 1989 was leave our a maximum in the GDR or Bulgaria, spent last year the Czechs 4.5 m holidays abroad in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Huge paradox, which we are not already aware, it is, in fact, that was not possible in 1989 for us in today&apos;s most popular travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Immediately in the early 1990s, the abolition of visa requirements in the neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge wave of short visits Austria Vienna or Germany in particular. </seg>
<seg id="497"> čechoslováci, could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone is there for a long time I would look at least for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> They were in Paris sleeping trips, for example, the Czechs in parks in tents, as our revenue nedovolovaly then, so that we can pay the hotel or penzion. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of travel was the Czechs in this time of vození own food banks, salámů, etc., in order to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible, the Czech koruna and our tourists can finally, after many destítkách years to buy western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living, and with it the average pay rise, however, which resulted in around 1997 in another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel, a travel agent prepare trips charterovými air spoji regularly since 1997, and the air trips due to the possibility of nasmlouvat quantitative sales in comparison with the past incredibly had become cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990&apos;s they already had the Czechs visa waiver to virtually all advanced countries in the world, apart from the US, which continues to facilitate our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of a post-revolutionary travel came right back in 2000, when he was due to the significant demand vypraven from the Czech Republic, the first ever direct charterový years in the exotiky, it was in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> From this year, and every year vylétávají with Czech tourists chartery direct to teplých distant lands, already this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic in the twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Exotic country visit currently has around 100 thousand Czechs per year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting point in this period, which stands for our post-revolutionary development came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> 17 November 2008 removed the US visas for Czech tourists and that our country definitively, among the most advanced countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, as well as the Czechs for the first time in the history of spent more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 tis. Kč per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> Most of it is to find the president once again but there is stalemate </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months is the Czech football without a President and there is a risk that Ivan haška successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic fačr - wo n&apos;t be known for another extraordinary general pile, which will take place on Thursday in the nymburce. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral law will proceed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without it, or begins to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Interested lead Czech football are Jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned from office in June, and in his retirement urged colleagues to get together and find a strong personality, leading football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> But in an era of football after haškovi sklouzl back to infighting between the two svazovými Commerce, which can not agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> There are shown on 16 September, when it should be the new President of the selected. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the into the National Home in Prague on smíchově sjeli unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained stalled and was not just a way of elections. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There is not a consensus, who actually has the right to a vote - if the only statutory representatives, or even the officials the full power. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In the only point a partial agreement since then, helped by the Constitution and the right for the state, in which representation on the basis of full power is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> There are disputes but still on the electoral law. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Did too much clarity to the situation did introduce or executive committee, which has already in their negotiations, whether regular or emergency, not in fact, nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Look at the possibility of elections has changed several times, but neuralgický point is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round in order to rule out the possibility of a stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &quot;Controversy is whether to be in line with the statutes or find another model,&quot; said one of the three Vice-Presidents fačr Dusan freedom, which represents professional football in the leadership of the association. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to the statutes of the proposed model wins in the third round, one of the candidates, which will have a greater percentage of support in the House, FOR WHICH IS running. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Morava is said to be prepared to go to the concession, that won the candidate who gets higher cost per cent of the votes in both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the Czech side on condition that the winner in this procentuálním population must be given at least a two-thirds dominance. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &quot;But it would then pozbývala sense the two previous rounds, it would be totally Office denied bicameral concept,&quot; understands the objections Moravské party freedom, which would have been the best of law neohýbat and vote according to current guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Somewhat surprisingly agrees with this, as well as Tomas paclík, although it is estimated that the statutes for election law suits peltovi most of all the candidates. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &quot;I wish to decide upon the maximum under statutes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &quot;In order to nevymýšlely Any substitute nonsense as the pile of the past,&quot; said owner Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and vymezoval primarily against the peltovi in their comments. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In nymburce according to him, the new president will be known, and believe that the candidates to work constructively together will be in the future. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &quot;All the passions reassures the possible today&apos;s procedure of the national team at the European Championship.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &quot;Football, it will be up to a wave, means there will be more willing to cooperate,&quot; jablonecký leader myself, which has experience with the management of the three biggest football at both professional and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is restrained. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &quot;I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very conflicted.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &quot;It is not from the Czech and moravy among people, but there are Focused efforts to adapt to the rules.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &quot;That can cause it, that will be blokaci General of once again.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &quot;But I hope that common sense will prevail,&quot; he said rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> The agreement of all parties, there is a lot of time. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some of the negotiations would have to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether to match will be the soccer generalita complete at all. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Airline speciál, in which should travel to podgorice Vice-Presidents, among other things Dalibor Kučera and rajchl, from Prague due to a technical neodletěl disorder morning and look for alternative option, as part of the Executive Committee of the theatres barážové retribution ship. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Perhaps in the end will be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, to which can be reported on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Minister of Education, Youth and tělovýchovy Joseph Dobeš would like to persuade divided parties within the sports associations in the country to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as in most of the čstv that will deal with the new direction of the Czech sport after financial problems sazky. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes into the fight on the President, because they get the right candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the players Plzně Tomas paclík a particular saw much of a strong candidate to meet all his ideas for a new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic fačr response - or would have to fight for the post. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &quot;If the quality of the adept existed, and the election of nejdu bojuju for it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &quot;But in the current situation, find none of these failed,&quot; he said ČTK paclík. </seg>
<seg id="552"> In the contest with Miroslav peltou and jindřichem rajchlem drives paclíka motivation to just peltovi alleged favoritovi elections, tried to avoid in the way of the fačr. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that in the case of his victory, in the role of President of survived only until 2013, when it is on the agenda of the General a good. </seg>
<seg id="554"> As prospective would like to see experienced and excellence manager who is not too linked to the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &quot;with some of the people who would come into consideration, I am talking.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &quot;For me It was crazy, though some said that, at this point, with the Czech football or do not want to identify.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="557"> &quot;Such a view, I would like to change,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Paclíkovi, now most of all with peltovo links with President plzeňského regional football union Romano berbrem man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as powerful a lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting delegates on the pile. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For paclíka is unacceptable, so that pelta came to the position. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &quot;If he won, so zakonzervuje the status quo and nothing would be in football&apos;s ahead.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &quot;in combination with the support of berbra, which is zdatným trader football, it would be even more,&quot; said paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Faces that peltovo name said in odposleších years ago in investigating the corruption affair, which, however, pelta left without punishment. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &quot;I do not know what the prestige of football peltovo victory would deliver.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &quot;And how we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; he said paclík, but he has also takes with grace its former statement that it would sell Plzeňský club, &quot;if the pelta became president.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the event that it paclík in Thursday&apos;s vote triumfoval, but with peltou could imagine the future cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Another candidate, is rajchl, which paclík supported before the zářijovou much of which ended in fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &quot;he - pelta - would be the first for whom he would like to go.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &quot;My great ability.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &quot;Could I imagine him to be as a team.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &quot;But manažersky would follow the association failed.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &quot;I also nestrkám nose, where I ca n&apos;t,&quot; he said paclík, which in September raised a great deal of attention to the fact that behind the cancellation of the Commission rozhodčích led by luďkem macelou, which replaced the Dagmar damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík argues that the leadership of the Association troufl. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Refers to its capacity of the management of private companies, also heads Plzni since last summer, which celebrated premiérový with his support in May ligový triumph. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &quot;I have the power to ensure that something has changed in the football environment, to contribute to a growing.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &quot;to limit the effects of certain interest groups that need to tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which goes to the nechutných situation,&quot; he said paclík, who made no secret of his antipathy to sparťanskému boss, for example, Daniel křetínskému immense. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of the priorities would also found the tightening of fačr relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help, for political leaders lobbied for it to be in the sport received more money from loterijní tax. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &quot;This is one of the key things that should be the new president to address.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &quot;If there is a taxing hazard to declare political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but on the table to say where the money goes,&quot; said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> As a burden now paclík takes or its link with plzeňským club, though he says that the President of fačr should be &quot;bipartisan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta, meanwhile, is associated with jabloncem rajchl with the Prague duklou. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &quot;It is not ideal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &quot;But I do not see or sense in someone clinging to převáděl their shares in the plzeňském club and there was a year and a half,&quot; he said paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new fačr, which would have excluded the electoral stalemate </seg>

<seg id="598"> Avizoval before, that they can see cooperation with jindřichem rajchlem, which recognises the because of his právnickému education, and his by the candidate opposing knows perfectly well that would be his first vice president. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Long neútočil or on the national paclíka, who, on the other hand, the peltovi left the thread dry. </seg>
<seg id="600"> &quot;In football there are little more than a year, has already received some successes.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &quot;His attacks, however, were indecent and a lot of people in a way zaskočil electoral campaign.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="857"> UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost bankruptcy and klouže from one crisis to another since then. </seg>
<seg id="858"> It now has a German compare. </seg>
<seg id="859"> The Axel Weber certainly thought so. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his noisy departure from the top of the leadership of the Federal Bank, has become known in July that 2013 to almost as spektakulárního takes a new job: president of the Governing Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - unexpected and lucrative step in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber were publicly praised the Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and friendly comments towards future colleagues said. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &quot;The UBS reach turnover.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &quot;I look forward to working with kasparem villigerem and oswaldem grübelem.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September, it was clear that everything will be totally different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> One dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank&apos;s security systems and around 1.7 billion euro zmarnil. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The UBS board Oswald grübel respected banker, had to leave, not only in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="867"> Since then, President of the Board of UBS is also as a opařený - and all are asking: when will finally Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already has become known, that he can advise the Bank since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> In May, and the Presidency of the Board of Directors of the Council&apos;s already - tell not only in 2013, as the Bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> It will be hard for Axela Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Is not a banker, a professor of economics and emissions banker and it would certainly time to translate the needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At the same time, will assume responsibility for the bank, which is once again proved that deserves the title &quot;of the bank&apos;s biggest scandals in Europe&quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> As UBS is both great - until recently, was the largest wealth manager in the world - and klouže both for years from one scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, will not proud Swiss bank free. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> In 2007 požívala UBS excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Image of mlčenlivého and solid, but also vychytralého Property Managers is combined with the ambitious goals: I would also mean something in the investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So managed UBS 2007 on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more affluent customers than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And, on the other hand, that as an investment bank in the league, the world&apos;s largest banks </seg>
<seg id="880"> That was the impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Former banker and longtime professor of banking in Zurich later, Hans Geiger tells his students: &quot;I have always a good bank UBS said at the time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &quot;from today&apos;s point of view, I have only one asks: how could so wrong?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> Very wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, it was clear that for the first time, something properly in the UBS gone wrong. </seg>
<seg id="885"> Stepped down in the middle of a board chairman Peter wuffli, which so far was also seen as highly intelligent and bankers genius. </seg>
<seg id="886"> In a few months later, tušilo, why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Investment bank division has wasted subprime-papíry and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> For this to defend, in fact, is recommending UBS capital increase of 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> It recently found really investors, one of which would be even ohrnovala nose: opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one or nedověděl its name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was only the first crash. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it was worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Bank had to admit new billions of dollars of losses, President of the Board of Directors of the Council Marcel ospel, 2006, for a second best all paid the Board of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 a disaster: the UBS was due to its bad investments from collapse in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Nationalbank odkoupila from UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds, for which could be spolumajitelkou banks. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole of Switzerland was otřeseno - as we všimlo, as it is dramatic for a small country, as it has on its territory and the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all, balance the sum was Switzerland&apos;s UBS 2007, more than five times greater than the performance of the economy - see picture. </seg>
<seg id="897"> &quot;Once again, we could save UBS &apos;banking expert Geiger says. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disaster follows another. </seg>
<seg id="899"> For several months now has capitulated to UBS in a tax dispute with America and the data has shown a willingness to the wealthy customers who, if possible, to help the banks krátili taxes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Also agreed to vyplacením 780 million dollars - such as the return of unjustified profits from these stores, including pokutové charges. </seg>
<seg id="901"> This has more or less openly that helped UBS tax cuts. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Lost at the same time, something that has always been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: svatozář secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After this scandal has been the Swiss banking secrecy, as before. </seg>
<seg id="904"> Followed by the head of the Board and President of the Board of Directors of the Council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of customers&apos; money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the Bank has lost its credibility in both the central business areas: in the space of a few months in the investment banking because of the bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to cut taxes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when this, a bit of calm, just when it is believed that UBS will pick up again, here comes this wretched business anabáze: one dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euro before Bank zpozorovala, that something is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking that probably still must be wrong. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &quot;case adoboli far too little has changed around, it was found that the health risks,&quot; says Martin Janssen, economist and finanz professor of finance at the banking Institute of the University Zürich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large German banks is sure: &quot;UBS problem lies in the fact that the risk is not coping with the control.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> Yet this was, after all, is the idea of a Swiss Bankers caution that start a long time ago, to become hlídači large estates in the world: not too much of a risk, but safety for money - as well as from the party of the Alpine republic, the collapse of the world. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Trezory Swiss banks have become a symbol for an unshakable reliability as a Lindt and sprüngli for particularly good chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> Headquarters UBS in Zurich, the more suited to cliché good Swiss private banks - it is just a little more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Location is no longer classical. </seg>
<seg id="915"> Bank has its headquarters in curyšské bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the curyšskému jezeru, which is zarámováno zasněženými heights Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Buildings here are beautiful, Pronájmy stores is one of the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Klenotnictví as Tiffany &apos;with there will be between the Swiss traditional stores such as ice cream parlors sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Already there is the home of Swiss banks for centuries, from the Nationalbank over palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In recepční shed UBS is heavy otáčivými doors. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are obložené mramorem in front of them massive Kožená seats, in addition to the large banks směrovka logo to &quot;sejfu.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS here knows what the customer is looking for: a security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of both the Swiss velkobanky Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse by or zradily, but sometimes - as is one of a small Swiss private bank head. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name would not want to read in the newspapers, concludes at the end of the day, as Swiss Bankers, all with two velkobankami shops. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS, perhaps too grown, finds - particularly in investment banking, where it is passed anglosasové. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss to perhaps do not have something to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &quot;And if after all, adapt to the long Anglo-Saxon ways systems.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> It was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which UBS has precipitated her first high profits and then momentum: none of the European Institute of financial disaster not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as schweizer großbank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> 15 October 2008 disaster was clear. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &quot;IN THE CENTER, agreed the ruling coalition sedmimilionové small countries on the biggest rescue action in the history of our nation,&quot; he writes Lukas hässig in his book &quot;Der ubs-crash.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros approved based velkobanku politicians to save from bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How can this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If we are talking with the Swiss Bankers, so they see the problem in the first place, the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, joined two of the three Swiss velkobank into massive concern. </seg>
<seg id="934"> A bank, which is already In a merger was too large to small Switzerland - and grew still further. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Yet be assisted, that the two different banking predecessor complement: a rich, but ospalá bank UBS in Zurich with the focus on wealth management, and poorer, but internationally more involved. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly came internacionalizovaní investment bankers favourably to many of the money with which they can jump-start a roulette. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names associated with the rise of UBS are: Peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, UBS chief concern and Marcel ospel, Chairman of the Board at the time. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &quot;I have always thought that wuffli and ospel are the team of the future,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and ospel, one following the feelings around žaludku, who drafted completely up the Bank of science.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But ospel is said to have relied on wuffliho to an end. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And at the end of wuffli probably made a mistake: &quot;Perhaps thought that his models are a reality,&quot; said Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &quot;This is a tragic case.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: hubris preceded the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> UBS employees can clearly recall the managers&apos; meetings, in which koncernový Chief wuffli repeated again and again the same slogan: bring the Goldman Sachs of the throne of the mines. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The bank has been the world&apos;s most powerful Investment Bank. </seg>
<seg id="947"> To &quot;league tables, access,&quot; which documents the success of banks that time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> In it, the UBS sought to putting up completely. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Several steps it has already forged. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the trade of currency and stock up part of the game completely. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Podnikoví advisers, who have been charged with the one weakness: in the international úrokovém trade, however, in the language of bankers&apos; fixed income for the biggest banks, perhaps there is a big gap. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has some gaps in the US hypotéčních products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To fill the gap closed, poised to UBS to adventure, which almost cost the existence of it. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, investment bank itself as well as it based on ensuring the risks to US investment fund subprime. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Developed into a machine, which přebaloval on US mortgage loans and securities an on - at the same time, but also himself leaving the risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even when other banks have long sought a way out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &quot;Even in the summer of 2007, when the property market was in flames, UBS kupovala there,&quot; says banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> How much is eufórie, so deep down. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager after another had to leave when he attempts uklidit were more difficult than had been thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Position at UBS, has been katapultovacím seat and until now houpou. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who is velkobanku now has nearly nezvládnutelnou work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Must find a strategy for the bank, all of which disappeared near business models. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Banking expert Geiger has no idea: the end of investment banking, focus on management of the property, a return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Quite so far while the Bank - still - does not want to go. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But investment banking has severely cut, so it is now clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday, the new head of bank Sergio ermotti intends to present to the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> 51-letý Swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, in fact, when the bank surprisingly rozešla predecessor grübelem. </seg>

<seg id="974"> The wants to make money? </seg>

<seg id="1450"> &quot;All of us have been presented as some orphans,&quot; an officer wrote in an email. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organisers thought it so well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But what I saw was not respect; it was a pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So completely the opposite perceptions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The army is bezbřeze are often included praise for for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But this is something praise, soldiers say. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public are increasingly behaving as if the individuals in uniform regretted. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &quot;We are not at all the victims,&quot; said Brigadier General will soon be leaving Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &quot;But it seems that the only way to some of us can support, is to put us in the position of the unfortunate souls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This issue is very sensitive for the army commander, who did not want to be nevděčně or to harm relations with the public, which serves. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Also realize that anger, which had to face once troops returning from Vietnam, was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> The result is that most of the words of regret is pronášena in silence and in private between the war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> When the two sons retired Colonel mark Cancian returning from combat actions, where is their father, served as members of the Marines, warned that look at their service will be people outside the army from two angles. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> From the point of view of Some will feel the respect and amazement because defeat the enemy insurgents, and visited exotická jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Other but will vrtat head, whether the &quot;Beneath the surface, neukrývá bad, violent,&quot; said veteran Cancian, who were involved in the fighting in Iraq and the return of a place in the government in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> Said that, when he sought a job and some of the people who do the interviews with him, they indicated that so soon after the return to the fight can withstand the stress, which is associated with the work in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &quot;When you talk about their service, you must take into account the negative reactions,&quot; poučoval Cancian their sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Concern army partly stems from the American indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Achievements on the field rarely get the recognition in the country, which has its own little awareness and the army in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are just a few of the benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &quot;As a nation, have nevážíme military heroism, as have been common in the Second World War,&quot; said Lt. Gen. David barno, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of the men under arms. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Soldiers are vyznamenáváni number of actions, which přetrpěli, a lot of friends who have lost, or for the extent of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Army faces growing pressure to crack down on rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week to determine whether the court process will begin 28 women and men against the army because of alleged inaction in the case of rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, are ready to bring to the hundreds of other applicants. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Vojínovi first class Elizabeth lymanové was in the night, when it was allegedly raped by my colleague from the army for 25 years and has been in the 11th week of pregnancy. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> Was in October 2008 and it pointed to the kasáren at the air base Miramar north of San diega. After dinner with crony have met with her male colleague of boxes with 12 pivy. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Ask, if we can add to it, that it could with her in the room a little popít. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &quot;in the press, I heed the warning light,&quot; described lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But rodilý texasan completely ignored its objections. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: No, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> &quot;It is from Texas,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &quot;I wish I listened to my gut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Claims that only a couple of minutes after vešli turn into the room, the man, threw it on the bed and znásilnil. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, 18 November, will be lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military to wait for the verdict of the hearings, which could be of historic impact. It will take place in the arlingtonu in virginii and goes in it, whether the accusations against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, donaldu fail, gets to court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> In the indictment states that Gates and he failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is at odds with the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Charges have been made in February the Washington lawyer Susan burkeovou and prosecutor party at the time had 17 members over the next few months, however, the number has risen to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claim that they have been znásilněni or otherwise sexually attacked his colleagues in the army and the army after the announcement of these útků failed in the investigation, punishment, as well as any of the pursuit of justice. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burkeová say that it is for the neck by senior commanders of the army, because the problem is just for them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &quot;The army is direktivním system,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &quot;Who are the people who are in a position that they can avoid trying to implement measures against such action? High Command.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burkeová also says that at least 400 other survivors called since February, from which many of them could become involved in other lawsuits brought in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Its strategy, rather than to seskupila all the accused in this case - naskládala all the eggs in one košíku as it itself - will action in several different cases, if necessary, to pressure nepolevil. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> State representative of the United States team for the Department of defense is Neil macbride which, together with its staff gave impetus to the rejection of the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Court documents, which won the Newsweek detail so far consider defence strategy - the bottom line is that current or former Soldiers can not sue army for the injuries, which have suffered as the members of the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to the Supreme Court of the 1950&apos;s as a feres doctrine federal government is not responsible for injuries, which suffers the soldiers in active service. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &apos;alleged injuries related to military service žalujících, &quot;writes in the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> But things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Even though women are still officially must not be used in the fight, it was just a clever: in modern warfare can be hard to find a clear the battle lines drawn. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women vyskytujícími in the war zone. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: Between the wars there were 150 female soldiers - two thirds of them directly in the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time to modernise and in the army, burkeová explains. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> In their fight is not alone and, in this case with three other legal representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School preparing for the four main visitors veteránského seminar on legal services and Military Academy for promoting hatred of women suspected of developing the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Independent non-profit Organization of American Vietnamese veterans&apos; On this basis for its action of moving against the army and the action focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder,&quot; which were allegedly found on the victims of rape, in order to give the military a pretext for their release, according to activists, such as, for example, Anu bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women&apos;s Action network, it is a fairly common practice. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Her group has already submitted the proposal in December of actions against the state organization for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for help from people who claimed they were sexually abused in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine separate proposals in Congress has been introduced, which presented a group of senators and members of both political parties, and proposed a series of amending the measure in them. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> According to the Defense Department office to prevent and resolve of sexual violence, nahlášeno 3 158 sexual attacks in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> This type of attacks, however, remains in the majority of cases neohlášen and according to its own estimates of the Pentagon, this figure is the equivalent of about 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents have occurred in the year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> In reports issued in March, is dismantled, as well as the criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, to court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half over the civilian judicial system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> Prosecutors in the case of a burkeové describe attacks just as the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Vojín first class lymanová nahlásila alleged rape by military police, for example, less than an hour later, as it should be. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> During the night, he says, has been asked for details about his repeated rape 11 times the various members of the police, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Undergo all the investigations needed to identify the rape and blood was found in her bed could - from the wounds, which made him on the arm. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> About six months later, in April 2009, had lymanová hearing before the court, during which they have been treated questions on whether she loved in the day of the attack, my friend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people have been předvoláno, which as witnesses on the reputation of the vypovídaly in favour of the alleged perpetrators, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &quot;I remember the day when the sentence was handed down,&quot; said the lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &quot;I had the feeling that, right there on the ground porodím - I vyběhla with shouting from the courtroom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &quot;Put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I think I am that my velícímu důstojníkovi: said it was not his court was my.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lymanové přikázali visit military psychiatrist, who with her at the end of the day, diagnostikoval personality disorder, which it described as nezpůsobilou to service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, was released from the army without honor and therefore with no right to výsluhu. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether or not the case lymanové and other žalobců will move to the next stage, it is there for the long haul, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> But, notes, &quot;from my point of view, they should be able to move to other stages of consultation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The doctrine, which stand between them and the verdict, however, has been criticized from the outset, we can see the light of day. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I myself have lifelong critic doctrine feres doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Army is a few decades behind, because of their responsibilities neudávají adhere to the same level motivačních incentives and deterrent funding. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Adds: &quot;Chances are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> Change to occur only when good people will be willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, burkevoá, lawyer žalujících, gathered hundreds of other people ready to take legal action and will start work on other cases on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &quot;We will not stop with the military fight on this issue, where there is no reform,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or as long as neumřeme, depending on what comes before. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: scientists are exploring how you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before Anders Behring breivik has become the new face of right extremism in Europe, was just Another young man, who his anti-immigrant views presented on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, the braivik, who has confessed to červencovému vraždícímu rage, after which left 77 people dead in Norway, in his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Despite breivik could act alone, in cyberspace is solitary: during the preparation of the attack was not spent a lot of time in front of computers, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists, supporting the right of a group on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about those people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But as it is to find? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy - just off of Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &quot;We have realized that get, it is not at all, so it is difficult,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report of the British research team, which was about the European Digital populism. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Of personal information on Facebook, Bartlett says, is so vast that scientists had to simply take advantage of advertising on the site and because of that, with complete accuracy determine hledanou demographic group - something that marketingoví workers do for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlettův team across Europe found half a million fans right groups and focus attention on them and circulated them buses. But instead of them is through them zvali into a newly formed group called them or offer any dietní products, is to fill in the questionnaire, which found the questions about the level of their education, their relation to violence and optimism about their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Through Facebook, bartlettovi and his colleagues have managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans, 14 different right wing groups in 11 European countries - all without having had to leave office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &quot;This is a completely new way of doing research,&quot; notes Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of the rightist groups are mostly young men, who popuzuje rising levels of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But, on the other hand, &quot;Those who their online activism combine with off-line aktivismem are more intelligent, more democratic and less násilničtí than those who remain constantly ukryti for screen of a computer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> Work team demos is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers these sites used to study everything from health issues to social trends of sheltering aktualizacemi, contributions to the walls and stisknutými tlačítky &quot;I like.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Facebook claims more than 800 million active users, each and every one of them a day on average, with three different data, which makes this social network literally &quot;information supernovu &apos;, which is for the development of many of the new research, and the number of academic work, in whose name is the word Facebook, has risen to nearly 800% compared to the situation five years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some of the scientists is the Facebook that gives them the opportunity to study people without it, that had to bother somewhere on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &quot;previously was that if you wanted to carry out a survey of the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &quot;You would have to go to the party, where Bartlett says not, but you never lose.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &quot;All of this Facebook odbourává - just go directly to them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others argue that site can offer a way to identify společensko-zdravotní problem and to avoid them. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> In a recent study doktorky Megan morenové from universities in the wisconsinu, the research team found that university students, who were raising their Serbia following a drunken output on Facebook, much more at risk of alcoholism problem than students who silent on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Morenová suggests that vrstevníci student monitor and come up with the supply of aid studentovi site, which publishes too many opileckých statusů. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &quot;The problem can not be resolved, if you can not diagnose it,&quot; he told the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of doktorky morenové and Director of the Center for children&apos;s health, behavior and development at dětském Research Institute in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &quot;We found a way to identify children at risk, that we would otherwise not have had the chance to discover.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook itself constantly sonduje data of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Information team sites by the statistics on the connection vztahových statusů and St. Valentine&apos;s Day, voter turnout in 2010 and leverage the satisfaction of the nation - mainly through the use of information, which should approach - internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should her information treasure to research, as well as the other available. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But Facebook users know that it is the monitors, whether they like it or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with crony, which is thousands of miles away, there is a need to provide their personal information website. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if Facebook users become part of the research, which do not know about? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to gather the data off-line online data, however, are open to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &quot;I think the majority of users or imagined that scientists could look to their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn sociologist in London knowledge lab, of the 2006 study, carried out by the public facebookových walls of their students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &quot;When it comes to them, take it, that the information is only between them and their friends.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then we also consider the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> And in research off-line, there is no guarantee that the body is completely sincere. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook it is impossible to verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &quot;What you are saying on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, these things are two completely segmented,&quot; explains Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is precisely why we Selwin, who spent long years research new technologies, thinks that tužka and zápisník continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &quot;When vyrazíte into the real world and you talk with real people, this is something that can not be replaced,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &quot;social research should be on society and social activities - and hell a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring breivik is taking part in his first public court trial </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring breivik, the man who has confessed to planning the two attacks, in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway in Oslo, during his first public court hearing described itself as a fighter &quot;resistance.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement, and between norskými templářskými rytíři,&quot; he said before the court, where 500 people have gathered. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &quot;I object to the Court of Justice, because you have given the mandate to support an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &quot;doznávám to their actions, but nepřiznávám no blame for them.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge torkjel nesheim during this monologue breivik off, because &quot;did not want to give breivikovi opportunity for this hearing to use as a platform from which it could proclaim their views.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Breivikovi rejected for the same reason, that has brought with it a speech prepared, allow at the end of a hearing to address the relatives of their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered police to keep breivik in custody the next 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media for a period of 4 týnů and announced that pravomocné authorities for a period of eight weeks will have complete control over all his visits and all the korespondencí. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Hearing involved about 30 relatives of victims and survivors. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope that they will be able to breivikovi look in the eye, the others, in order to make sure that it is held firmly locked. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All were involved in order to move the case to the early closure. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &quot;It seemed to me that seemed unemotionally, and the most inhuman way,&quot; he said komentátorovi NRK one of the survivors of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &quot;Nothing has been a comfortable, but then, as I saw for myself, I can say that, and uslyšel suspect, I am mentally moved a little bit further.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, in tmavém suit and blue kravatě remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. žurnalistům and retreat into the buildings without difficulty hledem present came in, as well as the surviving in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite breivik&apos;s bizarre idea that is part of a larger movement &quot;resistance,&quot; Judge naznal, that it is not crazy, and pointed out that there is no evidence to suggest he had any accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> For some consolation may be that the attacks appear to be the work of a single extremists from 22 June and not of the radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> It automatically does not diminish the sadness and confusion, however, which are still in the minds and hearts of the people. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &quot;I would like to see the vypadla as stvůra, but this is not so,&quot; he said of relatives of one of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &quot;If Yes, everything would be much easier.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1660"> The events took place last Thursday, when all of the nine judges gathered to be discussed by the management proposals on the table. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Was one of the probíraných cases action the 26 states zpochybňující a radical overhaul of the Health Care Law, which Congress approved last year - he, which mobilised conservative activists around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Judges agreed they will listen and, in March, however, is expected 5,5hodinové negotiations, the outcome of which is even more rozvíří presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at the time of the decision will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Lawyer, which stands before the Court of Justice and will strive to achieve the rejection of the law, it will most likely Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clementova legal firm, Bancroft pllc, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped finance the annual dinner of the federalist society, which has already spent years dealing with the defence of the conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company, which represents one of the trade association dinner has sponsored, Jones day, steadily growing groundswell of opinion challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>

<seg id="1674"> However, the relationship scalii and Thomas to two legal firms účinkujícím in case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in the case, more than enough to zalarmoval activists calling for ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &quot;This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is at odds with several judges, claiming that the Supreme Court is under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of common cause. </seg>

<seg id="1679"> Thomasova wife ginni is highly built Conservative campaigner. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Moreover, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly judge Elena kaganová and not scalia with Thomas. </seg>

<seg id="2059"> You never neopakujete repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that this is partly because we have nine ALB and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone loves the other&apos;s, so it is difficult to choose what songs will play every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we have two three songs in the repertoire, which we have not played for a long time, we focus on them, and we are also surprised, because we think on it, why are we so líbily and that we have forgotten to this May. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> So it is the show more interesting for us, and that is why I think that it is more interesting for people as well. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> This tour slavíte 20 years of artistic career. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, it is hard to believe, what you have done? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, certainly. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> Firstly, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a large rock group, and that we will remain in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We know how much we have been given and it moves us, that we can continue to play together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> Do we have to be happy and glad we make music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are fortunate that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> We could be better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What mean for you, that you were an important part of the žánru grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> Always an honour for us was that we can be part of this group, which is represented by the same velikáni. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> People from the Soundgarden mudhoney and Alice in chains are our friends. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising when there is movement from a group of friends, this does not happen very often. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time there will be in the city, but it is much less common for five to 10 groups coming from one city at once. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud of it and we are pleased that we can be part of a group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes with some even play. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in chains, and we were in Canada, with mudhoney. We are fortunate that we have seen Soundgarden on tour are all our friends and we are pleased that we can be part of the movement that began in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> Also it is very unusual for the group as yours to keep together and had even after those years are the same Members. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, we have four together for 21 years and Matt - Cameron - join us 13 years ago, which in itself is already much longer than the usual time of group. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> I think that, first of all, we are all fortunate that we are still in this world, and secondly, their role is played by the fact that we are always concerned about one another. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends and because of this, we have been able to open up the music the way that leave everyone enough freedom to own experimentation. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> Each other, we believe we do appreciate music of the second, and I think that it could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to the word celebration was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> As nacházíte balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> How we rostli was gradually becoming increasingly easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We are trying to nejezdit too on the tour, because it is very easy to fall into the trap of crowds and the people who love our music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> When you consider that people come for the music, confront is that with music and what you give it, you have to respect. You then you can not be carried away by famous rock stars that neither one of us have never really nezajímalo. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How Mother love bone remember another project? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we are writing great songs and at the beginning, it was something spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> As kapela No Pope an album we get there were three years and we have never been your birth certificate, after umřel Andy - Andrew woods. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> It was very frustrating, because it took so long and the most important thing is that, even today, přátelíme with brucem - fairweather - and gregem Gilmore, who started in the kapele with us, I will listen to a song, or if I look at carrying pictures, I remember Andy, it was incredible, as I was with him as nasmál; it was a pleasure to work with him, always laugh, a muzice or talk about football and many others. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an incredible person and we lack power. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> National kapela Las robertas will be tasked with that launched the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that you know their work, especially Eddie vedder, and that is why you have chosen is as předskokany? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, production, send us videos with several proposals and this group, we liked the most, which is why we are interested, as Las robertas offer take one, and they must be very funny. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why always take one you are changing the words of yellow Ledbetter? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> This is the question on the EDA - Eddie vedder, so that I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He words, and I think that makes it the first thing it invades. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> As a basistu affects who you? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> A lot of people. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> As a first I think Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney Chuck dukowski... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There is so much that I could all evening to talk about basistech who I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> As Pearl pits has managed to keep the grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think that we have always felt slightly separation from the words of grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> To say grunge presenting the group to which I have referred to as mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana and all the other, which came at the same time, and if it is even today this music in place, so it is great, because it is something that is worth listening to this music, and groups such as mudhoney play better muziku today than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the outset had your music is a bleak character and it is now more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What is behind this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting, because I feel that in the new albu is a couple of songs, which are lehčího kind, but there are also songs such as the end or juste breathe, which are considered to be very grim, even though they can be as positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> For both, it is Ed When I played, I cried, and it is deeply dark songs. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when vyrůstáš and is in the life of a trauma, ztratíš someone from the family or friend, these things will influence your art and music, and these two songs for me are just that. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that you can be a happy person and still do pochmurnou muziku. </seg>

<seg id="2188"> Architects have come together on the occasion of vypsání management, which carries with it more than a debate about the honorářů </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Urban selection process on 16 gates once again opens the debate about the role of the park collserola in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Flourish in the 1980s, at the time of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona CMB, the Authority vytiskla several pamfletů in support of the park collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Letáček defined the Mountain as a large fleet of metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> What is more, he was accompanied by figures you with newyorským Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> In 1987, disappeared after CMB Park is back in the minds of many as the upper limit led Barcelona. Catalan capital, is one of the few that do not focus on the axis of North, South, but up - Montenegro - down - sea. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Qualifications collseroly as a natural park is moving in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> References already was central park, but Yellowstone with divočáky instead of Bear Yogi. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> This has been the position until September, when city hall announced mega competition consisting of 16 konkurzy on the same number of entry doors to collseroly. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Taken, of course, plays rather the idea of park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone trying to put the gates on the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> So the only question is: collserola park or a mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisation on the basis of reflection on the city, the issue has become a central theme of all Barcelona architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is already the subject of just otřelé, such as when the two members of the old caste few at the meeting in the lift lodge hand. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it is This achievement has caused one of the rare shod between what they think the three barcelonští architects and předstoupivší university professors. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel roldán, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: selection process makes sense. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Načala issue, according to roldána after the Gulf of Mexico, &quot;There is a need to&quot; discuss, as well as a sign of &quot;mountain,&quot; so ildefonse CERDA on green apples dotažen was not in the end. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &quot;We must be based on the principle that nejrozlehlejším barcelonským Park is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, its great availability. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &quot;said the architect, for whom the title&quot; taken into collserola carries with it &quot;lexikologickou trap&quot;: &quot;We do not want to is a&quot; as inputs into the park, but rather as a defining zones, where it is possible to act. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as well as roldán and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanismu those kvalifikuje proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; offering &quot;Some danger.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risk resulting from the &quot;uncertainty, which today is a public place&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, which was in the area Forum its swan &quot;extraordinary.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first concern is the demarcation of the border, where they should be. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &quot;It means something to do for the next step,&quot; is, in principle, to move a step further. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &quot;We need to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current - with the legacy of the PGM general metropolitan plan - can cause a real disaster.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Looking in more detail on the issue, modol believes that údolní svah collserola &quot;can be seen in the park,&quot; but not the part of Barcelona, and for reasons of purely topographical. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol also remind you that there is already work that has patronat de collserola, which &quot;can not stop on smetišti, even though&quot; welcomes the fact that City Hall offers his grémiu, that in the hit from the first moment. &quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2215"> , and understand that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a propustkou, which allows architektům to get involved in the debate, but &quot;Doubt&quot; that it should be just the technical profile, which will lead the multidisciplinary teams - &quot;Is that all the skills, she adds,&quot; which is to be developed: &quot;architects should only be tools.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that has the name of the game, it is difficult, because in the material for the selection process is a global vision collserola: &quot;tender was 16, which apply to all the backbone of mountains - the sea, but there is no podélná study, which would view the area and see it as a whole.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This means that at least he has signed up to all 16 tenders. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the one taken may turn on the concept and the definition of an architect of the neighbouring gates. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> City Hall, in his view, should guarantee that the zone, just over the Ronda de Dalt should ensure in the entire length of the zone equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens. </seg>

<seg id="2292"> In his přednášce technological cause výmolů, which made in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that laboratory under his leadership is modified asfalty with polymery, which should rise to mix with similar characteristics, such as asfalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resistance, both in the low, at high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrero nájera believes that this kind of modified asfaltů could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some of the cities in the north of the country and improve the functionality and would reduce the creation of výmolů. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Explained that asfalt, the most difficult part of the oil is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, with a great molecular, referred to as asfalteny molecules, and the other with a low molecular, who call themselves the malteny together add asphalt with viskoelastický character. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viskoelastický nature of asphalt lies in the fact that the high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts as tekutina in 120 degrees viskozitu is high, and in almost 50 degrees is in solid shape, while at low temperatures asfalt tends to lámat, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but during the day it is according to the weather conditions and temperature, a chemical engineering expert pointed out. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> Scientist from the chemical school observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico City is covered by a flexible dlažbou, which is made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asfaltem. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the nejsvrchnějšími classes are asfaltová vložka, consisting of a small kamínky zalitými in the asphalt, and then stlačenými. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Stress that each block, which is made up of vložku, it is zalit asfaltem. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> In the passage of cars or in terms of the pressure, it is possible that the forces in the ditch well unravel. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it was a modified asfalt unravel would be even better, believes the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Add that on the asphalt vložku place last class called cry, consisting of a fine stones, pískem also zalitým in the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> In view of the fact that this class will come into contact with ráfky vehicles must be more mechanical power than asfaltová vložka and must ensure the friction roadway. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> In view of the fact that, as part of the dláždění will be subject to great burden, must have the mantle of sufficient tloušťku and must be careful in the material from which it is zhotoven. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> Climate, especially vlhkost and temperature changes, they are also very important factor, which is something to bear in mind, especially water has had a huge impact on the functionality of asfaltové vložky. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Once the terrain is vlhký water spread inside and it is difficult to get out, and that causes softening all levels of dlažby and the emergence of výmolů. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Explained that during a výmolů as the first poničí film pláště and only when there is damage to the asfaltové vložky. But does not damage in one moment, but it is a gradual process, which should stop at the first signs of the appropriate maintenance programmes. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> As a member of the national system, scientists also explained that the burden is another important factor in creating the výmolů vehicles, and that is why tloušťka each layer dlažby must respond to the burden of vehicles and must ensure that the burden below that is the only way we can prevent many of výmolů. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrero, pointed out that when it comes to asfalt, once we have a lot of work and research is at the beginning, it is worth noting, for example, asfaltové emulze in other countries, which are already available on the market and allow easily repaired výmoly without having to use a high temperature. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What did the ticket of Valle to become the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez serna win korunku Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle receives 14 title of the first vícemiss. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Valle del Cauca again reached on korunku Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Melina Ramírez serna had to be content with the fact that is at a podiu vítězek, won a silver korunku and šerpu, on the basis that has become the new first vícemiss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Based on the results of yesterday&apos;s final and won in the cartageně, in which žezla took Miss Atlántico, the département won 14 and the title of the first vícemiss. Melina join the zástupům women of the Valle del Cauca, who came close to winning korunce but, at the end of the day, the first was called vícemiss; these include Miriam ospina Benoit 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala - 1979 - Lorena Álvarez 1981, Rosa Mary alzate 1983, Olga María arenas 1987, Leila blanque 1988, Mónica Evers 1989, María Consuela Pinedo 1990, Diana Isabel Romero 1993, Mrs Garcés aljure 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure - 2008. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The question, that many are asking: What did? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> As a result, the defeat of the great favoritky, which in all the previous rounds has shown that it has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and nejhezčí face. joile de volgue these titles, such as taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, which have subsequently odnesly the title of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury decided to name only the first vícemiss, is the fact that it is not convinced by his answer to the question: &quot;which paper you liked the most, and why?,&quot; asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of literary editors leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> On the issue of she replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &quot;I read a lot and I very much hope in the role of literature, I believe that this is one of zkulturňování. knížka, which has the most influence in childhood,&quot; the little prince, &quot;was very deep paper. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the present time, I read &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot; It is a book that is part of the global literature, that we should all know., and today I have with me a book from Irene nemirovski Russian the authors. This is a wonderful book called &quot;El ardor de la sangre.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2322"> Admittedly, the answer is liked, both because of the deadline, one &quot;culturize&quot; and secondly, because it has not been list clarified, the individual the paper marked her. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> After the formal ceremony Melina has said that it is on hold and is pleased with the outcome: &quot;The world is wise, what is going to happen, it will happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And you people, čtěte little prince is a wonderful book, if you will. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorita. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Bogotský journalist suggested that the fact that she was from the beginning of the most popular nejoslavovanější and gastronomická challenge that drew all previous prices OSTER, the title of the public as the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother, gave rise to envy other uchazeček vystresovalo Queen, which then has failed on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> This was evident in the first presentation of the plavek on the beach hiltonu a coronation and during the final two přehlídek. A </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Even when both zářila, it was noticeable that lacked the strength and enthusiasm, which demonstrated reprezentantky from Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio journalist programme &quot;as&quot; at home to Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first vícemiss confirms the fact that list, which during the competition will receive the most titles at the end of the day, neodchází with korunkou Queen. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Moreover, Valle held more nevlídný attitude to the media in recent days and not pay for it. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince porotu about his interest in social work, which are at the heart of the national competition beauty. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Only on the margins of international member of men, two days before the election, Luca Doughty said that searching for the woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &quot;in the competition Miss Colombia beauty by itself is not enough, we need to see something more than just a physical beauty. There is a need to focus on the social conscience and it is important that the candidate before entering the competition, have been involved in such projects,&quot; explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> Also speculates that the list of the Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibróze, which has been the zadečku visible. But this is entirely at odds with the verdict of men, which they chose miss &quot;natural beauty&quot; and responsible for the healthiest body, a healthy diet physical activity. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Jorge Hernán Orozco which Queen preparing, acknowledges that the Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, &quot;but the problems with fibrózou to step up zadečku, which in my view did not see too much on the part, she stepped down points until the last day.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from magazine cromos believes that rodačka from Valle made a mistake when they undergo a surgical procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &quot;surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle wrong with them. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Body was never her strong side and we chose its tax. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this award, which the National Assembly for the first time udělovalo beauty, to have taken place in plavkách cruel predictions that the honor, said that this was a satisfying, which raymundo melině given that it will have at the end of the day, to the highest korunku. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina today, started the year of panování, not as the queen, but as a princess, from a position that allows it to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where the national competition will be appointed. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Go down in history as one of the queens, however, that despite the strhujícímu success in cartageně TO THE HIGHEST korunce falling. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> That was the work of the people Cali, which identified the corpse Alfonse Cana </seg>
<seg id="2343"> An expert on fingerprints in history as the man who came from Cali confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana. &quot;&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2344"> Work of these officers is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On November 4 last year, an expert on fingerprints of honor in Cali came in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the FARC, &quot;Alfonse Cana, and by comparing fingerprints.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who work on the separation of the honor this week, it was the turn of the eliazar González, men in the Puerta tejada, 21 years working in the area of research. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of their careers González worked in the municipalities in the Chocó, where he had often struggle pralesem more than five days to get to a place where they were walking, which needed to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000, the přemístil in capital of Valle and then, what was the rates to specialize in fingerprints. This science is the subject of a skin friction, dlaní hands and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week, when it was being carried out operations against the alfonsi canovi eliazarovi said, to take the clothes with them at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Expect something great. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> On Friday night pause in Cauca in a helicopter from palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> Know that it will have to identify two bodies and that the podezřívá, that one of them is the man who led the world&apos;s oldest guerillu, asked him to take card with the fingerprints of Guillermo leóna sáenze - his real name. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> However, when he came with the investigating team to a place where it was mrtvola, nepoznal because of the Physical Appearance and seemed quite differently than in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> As vesničan, did not vousy oblečený was in the area, without glasses, a much leaner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> It&apos;s not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Along with the galtonovou lupou, inkoustem and transplantátorem and light eliazar to compare the daktylové walking papers from card records. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> An eye it does not fall short: it was &quot;Alfonso cano.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2358"> The same night the man originally from Puerto tejada was charged, the Minister of Defense to juanu Carlos pinzónovi, confirmed that it was indeed a top FARC commander. </seg>

<seg id="2362"> Daktyloskopie is an exact science, without the possibility of mistakes, which can play a key role in deciding the offences. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In addition to the identification of corpses to these people in the research of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of people caught. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> If they are caught, Many offenders presented false documents or have no paper at all. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We retire fingerprints and looking for them is in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Investigator told that, in case of injury, he had in the House to remove a piece of the wall of the house, because at this point, a thief is based, to vytáhl trezor full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Walls are difficult, because they are not designed to collecting of, but in this case, we could have a mark on the hand and identify the perpetrators, who was involved in a number of krádežích, &quot;recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspect in the case of murder. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently found the dead man with the lahvemi alcohol around them. </seg>

<seg id="2373"> When there are, as well as for their collection is transplantátor or the tape. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Then they would be sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or registraturu. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &quot;The problem is that at the present time, there are still many kolumbijců, whose data are not listed anywhere,&quot; said an expert from the honor. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> Explained that not everything is the same as in the television programme CSI shows. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As well as all that třpytí, not gold, not at all what the dotknete, traces remain. </seg>

<seg id="2462"> Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> Angela Merkel&apos;s několikaminutové standing ovation at the end of the speech, and then a few hours later, very pro-European finance minister, Wolfgang schäubla have left room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The idea of The Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: Europe&apos;s response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only is that Europe is peace, but because of the &quot;Nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> According to the Chancellor in Europe, &quot;it is time for change.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> That could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty allowing fiscal policies to strengthen control over European Union member countries of the euro zone, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, &quot;in order to give Europe a face.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any case, that is one of the ideas the proposal adopted by Congress, which is inspirátorem clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries to agree on this revolutionary move quickly: is opposed by Britain and the leaders of the CDU, think that the same approach will also Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>

<seg id="2471"> As well as the delegates rejected the proposal by a large majority to appreciate the weight of each country in the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany. </seg>

<seg id="2473"> While the proposal for Europe to one paragraph of the importance of Angela Merkel, France failed to quote &quot;Franco-German friendship.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Only indirectly. </seg>

<seg id="2476"> In fact it was one of the most pokořujících slaughter Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What is a fraud in sick? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After subsidies spouštějí UMP party and the government offensive against the labour neschopnostem. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux, and visits the office for the provision of social support, from where prosloví speech on the subject of the year 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> As an escort of the offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but it is no less clear from the point of view of the presidential campaign, the majority of the right wants to concentrate on the sick. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First of all because of budgetary savings the Government intends to impose on fourth day of a private sector employees before the start taking support in the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without the consent of the company would be an employee, who is ill, lost four days wages, so at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Measures to create a lot of bad blood, but that risks, according to the forest Echos may bring about 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures symbolic impact: to give government employees a day nehrazené sick - until now have no failure over three days in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are also under discussion, the majority of the right it triggers theme of fraud aimed to abuses linked with the labor neschopnostmi this time. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> Controls will be much larger, and: &quot;If you get caught, you will be back,&quot; Xavier Bertrand pointed out in an interview RTL individual granting station on Sunday, 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seems somewhat disproportionate to the truth of the nepravostech in job neschopnostech. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught of that bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Stopping first on the official figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the Caisse nationale d&apos;assurance maladie - CNAM - State health insurance companies - compensation has been paid out in 2006, more than 237 million euro daily. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the health sector represented the compensation in 2008, with its 11,3 billion euro 5% of expenditure on health care. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of that amount to 46% of the concerned parent contributions and accidents and 54% of related to the failure, i.e. 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> So only 2.5% of the costs of health care. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> According to the study of the old consulting should the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days of disability from 17,8 days in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> Average, which holds some variation: a different Anketa published in the 2007 on the website of dealing with job opportunities monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said that they nevybralo no sick day. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time by nemocenského insurance institutions, specifies that in the 2010 37,8% of the failure was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15% from 1 to 15 days within 1 month, three months and 11% took longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When it is compared to their European neighbours, French workers are more prone to work neschopnostem than elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One long study by two researchers in 2010 CNRS &apos;National Research Centre showed that between 1994 and 2001 overall absence - for health reasons or not - has alternated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% in France and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Cheating in job neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> When it comes to fraud, these are just small scale. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> Strengthen legislation since the 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks aimed at working the failure of more than 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, CNAM stated that 1.5 million in checks was 13.8% for the 285,000 carried out because of the short neschopnostem &quot;wrong or too long,&quot; i.e., 37 050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of systematically controlled the failure of longer than 45 days, napočítalo 11% of the cases, &quot;nepřizpůsobených or ineligible to 1.2 million, i.e. the 132 000 controls.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2505"> A total of 169, 000 &apos;unjustified&apos; cases for several million employees, who were working a failure. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Figure, which is much less than the number of work on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to a member of the UMP Dominique tiana, author of The June report on this issue, this figure would represent a 9 to 15 billion euros of missing in collecting taxes for the year, which is more than the total amount of daily allowances and so infinitely more than fraud related to the above. </seg>

<seg id="2677"> Facts must win over dogma </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is an issue that can not be approached on the basis of the balance sheets or under the emotions, then it is energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Disponibilita and the price of electricity, have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is natural for meetings in the election was an opportunity to think about such savings and on the ground, which takes power from nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Debate will be successful only when we examine all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French have set up their position on the objective facts and rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> So far, 7 billion human beings on the planet, But the demographic trends will odteďka doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, if we do not want a large proportion of the world&apos;s population of important part of life. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, face a shortage of fossil resources will be required in order to continue to produce electricity, and can not forget about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against climate change, which is something which at the moment are disappearing from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> Accident in Fukushima will have no effect on any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> But this is not the case with Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source of very capable of replacing them, or Switzerland, which sees fit to build only the last generation plants. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote the at least some of the countries are continuing with the determination of their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States has decided to expand its fleet after Fukushima on one unit of the construction of a power plant suspended power plants three pleasantly Iceland after the accident. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the German model based on renewable energy, sometimes presented as an example of the reality contradicts this. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The Berlin is seen rising electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas prices importovaném especially from Russia, the rapid rise in CO2 emissions caused by construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Within a few months, all of these bad effects to be felt. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Case of Denmark deserves to look at him. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> The European champion in wind power plants, of which accounts for 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of irregularities wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are increased by 65% and 50%, rather than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> On the other hand, thanks to our energy policy will pay for our neighbours more stable electricity bill by 40% higher than at the French households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalized economy in energy costs are a key element of competitiveness and the guarantee of keeping the industry on the national territory, the French companies enjoy the benefits of nejlacinější electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would give rise to a strong increase in electricity prices, which would make iluzorními beautiful statement on the industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Price that the vast majority of the French refuses to pay, as well as the are not against the energy, as polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us remember that our country&apos;s energy policy to stand up to the 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 related jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Exportující industry for us is heavily on international markets, a large number of small and medium sized specialist businesses create jobs that can not be transferred abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France has decided to abandon the sacrifice would be quite a number of small and medium sized enterprises and came about 6 billion euros per year, that the country is for the export of nuclear facilities and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> That ordered the owner of the plant, the nuclear reactor designed to operate 60 years, while it was planned decline of its producers? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In addressing the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic bullet for the production of energy source, and that there is no a deadly. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Development of facilities producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment, using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group Areva testifies to the complementarity of energy resources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the event of a nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts rigorous and transparent monitoring of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new power plants in flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, they have the idea of security in the blood. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Met the nuclear industry three serious accidents in fifty years. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> One remained in three pleasantly Iceland occurred in normal traffic conditions and without human victims, and the consequences for the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl drama created the concept of the reactor and no human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters the unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will take the lessons learned from this accident, just as it did in the two previous. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> Fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities on nuclear safety, and designers is that type of reactor operators EPR is a concept of the capable of resisting such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While all candidates who want to build a nuclear power plant, to see it, to stop its construction in the flamanville would be a great gift nabídnutým competitors of the Areva EDF and relaxation of the travel and companies the opportunity to seize the lead in the nuclear development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate energy to find the best solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and schemes have come to dominate the debate as key to the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> It is a burden for the economy of immigration or chance? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> In the area of immigration policy pursued for Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - overloading the police, the courts and the administration subjected policy numbers make this policy to the status &quot;of the country of human rights,&quot; which France boast. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently, it was the administrative harassment, whose object were foreign students, which has become the current when Interior Minister - see the newspaper Libération on 23 May - said that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, zedníky and servírky.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But so far has been rarely rozebírána under úhlem economies. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> It must be said that in this area are quite broad agreement between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> On the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that &quot;900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million immigrant workers,&quot; and on the left, Michel Rocard, when in 1990, said that France &quot;can not take all the misery of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the level of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, was the fear of invasion hord Polish plumbers on French territory obvious in on both the right and the left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden on the economy and the French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference lies in the level of generosity that uráčíme immigrants provide. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> François Hollande in its programme is limited to banalities, when sales, a development that will solve our &apos;migration problem. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in the elections, economically, but it is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As economists that resemble Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published work syntetizujícím the latest knowledge about immigration - Exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 Str.: there is broad consensus among specialists migratory movements on the positive impact on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that immigrants are taking. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Reducing immigration is crippling and harmful to the employment growth. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace the French workers, especially those less qualified, and create downward pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants by much more than náhradníky for French workers by doing work in sectors with a lack of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Few skilled immigrants in sectors that nepřitahují French workers, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive impact on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as the surgeon will have difficulties with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesteziologů, this addition between French and migrants are that příchody immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni peri have calculated that growth of migratory movements by 1% will trigger a rise in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And at the same time, does not take into account the fact that the diversity of přinášená Immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth - a high proportion naturalizovaných immigrants between us, the Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, the paypal eBay immigrants and Yahoo are based. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also net contributors to the social systems in European countries for an average of 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The World Organization work in Germany, for example, estimates that one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring for their whole life to public finances net contribution - revenue minus spending - with the explosive power of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s desire to be at the start of his mandate for the missing percent growth &quot;with vyceněnými teeth.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Said it intended to deter immigrants have just the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe - vynalezla democracy, there is a European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a rare and also very fragile goods. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent on this should recall two thousand years ago in Athens, after all, despite the fact that it invented, experienced in the XX. century tragedy of World Wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also of Franco in Spain, salazara in Portugal and the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some people might believe, that in order for a democracy to definitively were triumphs over their foes, will be enough to make a choice and implement it in the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> But is already knows from Napoleon, that it was about the ease of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, even if it is a sine qua non for Democracy, is not a sufficient and can become &quot;an instrument of repression&quot; as Republican philosopher once said Etienne vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No democracy requires much more: the public space, the spirit, the values, the separation of power and control enlightenment, education, social and economic solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Europe&apos;s crisis, we are going through is a crisis of economic policy, but it is just so, and since the beginning of the crisis and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Acknowledging the mistakes of the Greek referendum of ano-ne will have double the value in this respect: the need for a return to political power, but also the worrying feeling his inability, nevhodnosti. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be promýšlena, so that it can be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the line of the democratic struggle, přemístily today, and that many of the Republican fighters have already nestřílejí in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> Nothing we can win if we require a number of national referendums organised by according to need and in a disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Blank exposed European absolutist monarchovi or leap with tied down into a void of the nationalist deep: what choice for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want it gilotiny, but a common, a fully fledged, peaceful and the steady performance of choice and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Are the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, after all, and we did n&apos;t know where the STOP now - is because of the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> This is, of course, the whole of Europe sklánějící before the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its failure and its lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> This is, of course, the whole of Europe, which is ponižována on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Zneklidňujeme in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and each of its nations with it. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> As a matter of urgency democratic sovereignty must be returned to the management of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Europeans because only together will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of government markets and investment for the future. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> East of the crisis will assume the decision at the European level, which can not be made without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we would be brought into the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Then, what we have long fought against the proposal of Socialists and Jacques Delors, all strongly today demanding the European economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> So be it. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and a passionate citizens as a whole, it would be new madness and a dead end. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We have to take on a new phase of the European construction. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To create a republic in France, it was essential to &quot;Be Republicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Revolution in the interests could be enough to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> That lesson is to continue. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This will only be able to carry out building Europe&apos;s more politically democratic, and the genuine European democratic sovereignty. </seg>
