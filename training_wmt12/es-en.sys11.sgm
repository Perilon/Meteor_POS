<seg id="111"> The hairdressers also be a good psicólogo, argue the professionals </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the article, how can learn the introductory estilistas, because I complained un poco that initial ya lessons were quite charged. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I had no idea how to run things. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Conferences three officers working in the industry, to people how vestir problemáticos y, moreover, a seminar sobre how it works in the entertainment industry. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It will be peor. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer they are final examinations, more information and tareas prácticas ahead </seg>
<seg id="117"> Although the current y develops each sábado y Sunday, no longer has a pin. </seg>
<seg id="118"> We are vez have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course, there is no man) on how vestir to the woman who has no simetría perfecta. </seg>
<seg id="119"> Y that is the great majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone is cuellicorto, anyone has a feature stylized sin curves right and someone sufre sobrepeso. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The hairdressers know suavizar ópticamente unos to prolong a broad shoulders, neck o recrear curves necessary </seg>
<seg id="122"> We have been given certain trucos sobre how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, of pechos y caderas huge pero waist close and at the same time not vestirla in a way too challenging </seg>
<seg id="123"> Si, for example, the difference between the waist and the caderas is all que skirts o trousers are not appropriate, it is worth asking sewing at least an extra trozo patches to measure. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Sin certainly will not regret, because the clothing that sienta perfectamente is invaluable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> With a skirt to measure sentirá much better than with a question which not to move, stand up, danced in the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The body stylised se puede permitir vestir ropa with pliegues, ornaments, embroidery o drapeados. </seg>
<seg id="127"> There are certainly many types of information and of bodies, so I am pleased that we have all week to poner orden in my all this information. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And even then, I fear that the task assigned tengo, because more than adequately. </seg>
<seg id="129"> To each participant in the current has been assigned two famous, that he will have to devise two vestuarios: one for the day and the evening otro para. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We need to take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion than se tailored to the person in question. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I was vestir » to Miranda Kerr, perhaps you speak of the campaign of Victoria &apos;s secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Cry for inside, that to me is a lot better than, for example, Britney Spears o Christina Aguilera, which recently have fattened unos 100 kilograms (in favour, will take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> Dresses tenemos que recortarlos of magazines o later on the Internet and imprimirlos after drawing them graphically. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The moodboard, which is as it is called the outcome is complete, expresses up our personal style y nuestra relación with the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is also important to pensar in the chart in the styling. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The hairdressers, therefore, not viste solo physically, but is also involved, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (specific topics, as trends, handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> All of this told us the hairdressers y designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Pero todo this is already para Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> The hairdressers has have global. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on todo tipo of bodies. </seg>
<seg id="141"> The hairdressers Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka y photographer of fashion Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the hairdressers should saberle sacar partido to this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> Un y good hairdressers sabe trabajar with the same prenda dress in various ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability is, in this case, central. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So, the gabardina (or as they say in English, trench coat -) can be vestir to classic with vaqueros y T - shirt, but also serves to vestir the naked body with of zapatos tacón y fotografiarlo as if it were in fact a vestido. </seg>
<seg id="146"> O well enough arremangarla y subir the neck for obtener una totally different picture. </seg>
<seg id="147"> « Jugad this ”, he insisted. </seg>
<seg id="148"> What more valoro Council is the following: “ to begin to work, it is essential that you speak primero todas the rules ”. </seg>
<seg id="149"> « Then podéis romperlas » Jakub, said. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Por so it is clear why memorizamos todas these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it in magazines resultados we are different. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention the parades. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that hairdressers tiene que tener more types of clothes in the reserve aimed at taking photographs. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So, for a history of fashion than tenga ten pages (so, ten outfits), we have to take preparadas, ready to usar, at least 15. </seg>
<seg id="154"> In addition to the photos y clothes works in combination with other prendas, all of which are different from those which are in use in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Todo that needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and the style suponen themselves, in many cases, half of success. </seg>
<seg id="157"> You only have to look at to Madonna, which is not exactly one singer extraordinary, but the image and márquetin have made it a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear tendencia to use the services of the estilistas. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Until the characters famous también find them useless (enough my abilities, my physical aspect does not have so much importance). </seg>
<seg id="160"> Y when someone asks us nuestros servicios, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a talla very different to his real (lower). </seg>
<seg id="161"> Only queda guglear y find out if the magazines of the heart ya have written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight / thinned, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> On Sunday, Honza y Mario we insisted that the hairdressers is not enough orientarse in fashion, but must understand outfit. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In her work, was primarily must communicate with people to the one dressed, so it is essential to be good un psicólogo. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Sabe valorar people, not less, defends its opiniones. </seg>
<seg id="165"> « When a headmistress os para recruited him clasifiquéis the vestuario y que se the completéis in fine, you can &apos;t throw - away todo what was, and say: “ Huy qué horror » ». </seg>
<seg id="166"> « Encontrad at least a couple of things that podáis ponderar y que recomendar para someone may poner », says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> Él also showed us that todo should be in the so - called “ placovka », that is to say, the stock exchange. </seg>
<seg id="168"> This is set around the waist and se tienen a necessary tools. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Son objetos as tijeras, as tijeras, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. there is also a thread of nylon (which use the hairdressers during the session on photos of products such as handbags o que caps), pinzas special can clothing por ahead, if this were higher (the pins, y otro tipo of enganches are not allowed, which could damage the fabric), or a game of tailoring. </seg>
<seg id="170"> Para not to stay in the listening pasiva y poner something into practice, we have learned to become the suela of shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even during the sessions of photos in the study, in an area plana, it could damage the suela y much more abroad. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Y we did more than revestir y revestir. </seg>
<seg id="173"> We could not tocar shoes with scissors para not harm por accident. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So we have to be very adept. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario has given me a joy to pay tribute to my work reservas sin. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The truth is that it does not give me very well these skills. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Ya I have realised that devote myself to the styling at a professional level is not a way of talking, but I see exactly like what people say. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for Speed The Run: se toda compete for America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Reseña </seg>
<seg id="181"> Un viaje carefree, in principle, it is complicated because of a series of lapses improper of a journey rutinario during the next morning. </seg>
<seg id="182"> To some extent it failed to meet expectations, but that is not helpful, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="183"> The new delivery, which adds to the title se the Run, attracted a great expectations ya before its premiere. </seg>
<seg id="184"> Prometía que give new pieces to the former saga of racing Need for Speed y, following what is shown, appears as a game that should not end up being otra vez un gender of action with no more. </seg>
<seg id="185"> También we are curious por saber how quedarían inserted the scenes, where the character principal drops from car and walk around su propio pie. </seg>
<seg id="186"> As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results have not changed very little about what we could have hoped for. </seg>
<seg id="187"> There are racing que se pueden to acceptable, but in the total se pierden puntos because of failures absurd, which have been appearing in the series for years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> In reality, you cannot call errors, but rather the unwillingness of incomprehensible programmers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Se os introduces in a story, the protagonist, Jack, has some problems personales; for resolverlos, he is offered in a race participar illegal toda America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> You sentáis behind the wheel in the west coast, in San Francisco, and vuestra mission is to get the first to New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea is to offer something interesting. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route was divided into 10 stages and, then, in more than 50 careers. </seg>
<seg id="194"> It follows that every race tiene ruta for a different and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting. </seg>
<seg id="195"> That way, you must not remotely the feeling that the game ofrezca siempre. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the areas resultan even pleasant in sight, although the technical level graph is equivalent to that of previous rendition of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Por tanto, is nothing out of the ordinary. </seg>
<seg id="198"> Pero the ride por the desert, the landscape otoñal o the high mountains of snow covered producen un visual effect is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> In addition, the careers diversifying from time to time when for a typical element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> So, for example, in the desert os encontráis una tormenta of sand that reduced visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> Instead, in the mountains of the need to be careful that you sepulte una avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Según that, each of the racing is very well developed. </seg>
<seg id="203"> There are a couple of solo models, but this is enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a moment, trying to bring to a number of rivals required (normal in a race classic), after tratáis to gain time (classic duel timed) and then os expects a duel against a solo adversary. </seg>
<seg id="205"> In the middle of all this is sometimes the police, which only complicate matters further. </seg>
<seg id="206"> The novelty son the landscape outside of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Se presentan interactive animations when Jack, in the majority of cases, it has to escape from someone and vosotros tenéis que help, always pulsando button just at the right time. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Resulta sorprendente, however, that it has fewer paisajes in the game of what we would expect (in particular there is only tres). </seg>
<seg id="210"> Pero the end result is a good thing, because this is not to be rude, y in the already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game resulte more interesting. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model of driving sigue the fingerprints of previous episodes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that already today is not much, but you cannot claim to be a bad thing. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Si buscáis una simulación realista, already podéis look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> Pero to a career designed quite action suits him quite this driving style, but we can find something better between games of the competition. </seg>
<seg id="215"> So far, so good. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Pero problems arise after a certain amount of time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the right of the models of driving, because the same is not true of the collisions. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Games of this sort cannot expect recree deformations y collisions complicated, but in fact, before a coup against any objeto, you can &apos;t predecir how reaccionará vuestro Auto, which means that not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> It is typical that, as a forward very tight or move the car with traffic normal, only has roces light, but in other situations, almost identical, your car has just doing piruetas got out of control. </seg>
<seg id="220"> O even just totalmente destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system of reseteo, are not big problems, but it can poneros in a bad mood. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The reseteos are programmed so that, when sufres un accident or te sales of the runway, the game te restituye the last point rescue on the runway. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Sin embargo, in every race solo se has five reseteos available. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The si consumís todas, you must reiniciar the race from the start. </seg>
<seg id="225"> So it is no more than a help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very unreliable. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only learned the aid given the stage of memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Una great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts repiten in different places. </seg>

<seg id="313"> The innovative IBM enters its segundo siglo of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> Someone término que si seek a defines with great precision the strategy of IBM, the clearest sería « long term ”. </seg>
<seg id="315"> Para the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is percibe as current and, however, it has now been 100 years since its founding. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this nature largoplacista put it the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Ya él coined the slogan that many problems in the world have solución si people is ready to think. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Su slogan “ think! ” is made in its sello, around which will be building the life of the future (giant was also the title of a magazine internal IBM began to publish in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted. </seg>
<seg id="320"> « Para us, IBM pensamiento involves a long - term, a perpetual motion in the direction of the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived y prosperado for over 100 years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without temer changes around. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This has allowed us to, during our primer siglo, transform technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We expect prosperar even more in our second siglo », said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Un sistema sofisticado </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson, as in the 1930s - the care of their employees as the employer of Baťa in the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were among the first operarios Americans who enjoyed paid leave, safe, uniform elegant and un sofisticado sistema remuneration premiaba the best inventors and vendedores. </seg>
<seg id="326"> The same sofisticación long - term keeps the IBM in the relationship with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> Ya from the beginning the company supo discover talentos (as one of the first global firms in putting an end to any kind of discrimination, could choose without problemas). </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with the strategy of anti - discrimination is the current plan of IBM, Palmisano to replace it the forward woman: Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> She has been working treinta years at IBM, where it has been head of sales, márquetin y strategies. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Over the last few years, IBM has played the so - called meetings virtuales, rain of ideas in line, from countless future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is no surprise that sobren ideas, because in the signature trabajan almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Una institution with a good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> The position in the business proporciona fixed to the company a strong image internal and external. </seg>
<seg id="334"> « From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution more than company tecnológica » profesora economist, says the Harvard Business School y author of the book on IBM Rosabeth in Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> « IBM is not a company tecnológica, but a company that seeks to resolve problemas of business for usuarios of technology ” puntualiza George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or the “ Great verde » - as it is known in the US families because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the biggest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The company is possibly tecnológica more versatile (develops tanto equipment such as infrastructure and services accommodation web within a wide range of services, ranging from servidores until nanotechnology). </seg>
<seg id="339"> Ostenta the largest number of patents all the technology companies in the United States and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among its inventions se found the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, the bar codes; the diskettes. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM facturará this year 220 billion dollars. this year has become the second signing tecnológica por market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when superó por primera vez in 1996 to Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking to the future </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the taste of the clients and the time (IBM not opted for su propio sistema operativo, OS / 2, services online Prodigy u ordenadores IBM PCjr). </seg>
<seg id="344"> « Si su business based in advance, can &apos;t emotionally anchor in the past ”, acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Por that IBM has no problems on building up its bases in other plataformas (and equally, if not working, left). </seg>
<seg id="346"> Y there is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which are basically maintains and falls siempre exclusively with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Tecnología future </seg>
<seg id="348"> In a matter of sales, IBM se devotes sobre todo services, of which approximately one fifth son of programmes and otra quinta equipment. </seg>
<seg id="349"> However, even in 1990 teams representaban more than half of the share of suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="350"> In the year 2000, IBM has sold assets of underperformance por un valor total of $15 billion over the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology of the future. </seg>
<seg id="351"> The investments have followed since 2008, when we first said the modern global financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis of the 29 increased investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Parece que until now the company IBM has been able to weather the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 estratosféricamente has grown to a 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The currency of IBM is changing all, save its valor. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Se puede, therefore, expect that when I come to the next crisis, this giant flexible aguantará. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM &apos;s history: from the cortadora cheese until space flight </seg>
<seg id="358"> The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>

<seg id="363"> Flint fichó at the head of a company in the competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company. </seg>

<seg id="368"> Watson was so crucial to the company, tras almost 40 years of elected chair of the Head, was replaced by su son, Thomas Watson Junior. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership, IBM started work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming. </seg>

<seg id="480"> The goals of Jets were marked by five players who pusieron end to a series of defeats que ya lasted five parties. </seg>
<seg id="481"> How have evolved the price of travel since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> Until 1989 had in Czechoslovakia, only five state licensed travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea y Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Travel agencies of the time vendían in the majority of cases viajes solo at the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (Democratic Republic German), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> Una positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when we could viajar to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime se tipped to the west and the journeys of czech tourists were then quite restringidos. </seg>
<seg id="486"> Una great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i also Checoeslovacos) is not enable them to viajar free and individually, even by the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> Si un citizen quería viajar individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, it needed a letter of invitation, if not, the journey individual was not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The travel agencies ofrecían in those days también viajes to the west, but one should the tail with a sack of sleep and pasar all night - or we hold « good » known in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Still, not everything was won. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so - called “ promesa of change ” que was the prerequisite for travel to the West, not been attached to the “ people políticamente poco reliable ”, which will not be able to travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The currency checoslovaca was not a currency freely convertible y, without a guarantee of change, was possible at the resources (the currency occidental viajar) for the West. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The vast majority of the Czechs pasaban sus vacaciones in their own country, which is why there was a large number of huts and summer houses, which the Czechs. on this habit todavía persiste. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The way to travel in the Czechs has suffered from the real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Until 1989 to us was not going more pasar holidays in the GDR o Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips on holiday to countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> Resulta nna great paradox, which now are not aware of the fact that the current favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not be viajar freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> At the beginning of the 1990s imposed visa - free travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which brought a huge oleada visits short - term, particularly at Vienna or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The checoeslovacos, for a long time, has not seen enough of the trips to the west, the whole world wanted to verlo what at least for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Por example, sleeping in Paris the Czechs in parks in tents, as our income then not afforded us pagar un hotel or pensión. </seg>
<seg id="499"> Una characteristic of the Czechs of that time was the take with them (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Otro important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the czech koruna, part of our turistas podían finally, after decades, freely buy currency occidental. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living rising y through average wages, which around 1997 provocó un increase in demand for travel. </seg>
<seg id="502"> With the increasing demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 regularly, to prepare the travel usando connections charter, which made incredibly lower prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts por the volume of passengers. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs viajaban sin visado in almost every developed country, except in the US, which simplificó even more nuestros viajes. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Otro interesting moment in the history of tourism pos - revolutionary sucedió ya in 2000, when it was organised, thanks to a huge demand, the first plane direct from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and it was to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since that year, todos years vuelos direct charter with turistas Czechs made países distant and hot. this winter ya se volará directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> The countries exotic visit currently some 100,000 czech per year. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Otro interesting moment of this era, which symbolises nuestro development pos - revolutionary, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On November 17, 2008, US removed visas for tourists Czechs, with what our país pasó to be among the world &apos;s most developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in its history, it has been more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and by primera vez in its history, have been spent on foreign travel more than $15 CZK por heads, including the costs in the place of residence. </seg>
<seg id="510"> General Assembly convened ordinaria para elect the President, which could end up again at a standstill. </seg>
<seg id="511"> For almost five months football czech is without presidente y is likely to be the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR), is not known, nor tras the convening of the next General Assembly extraordinary tendrá this Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow. </seg>
<seg id="513"> The same sin, there can be no votar siquiera para choose between the three candidates. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Interested parties to chair the football czech son Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta y Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek renunció to his office in June but not before calling his colleagues with the aim of finding a persona strong supiese ocuparse of football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Sin embargo, after the end of era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was made clear the September 16, when it had to ser elected the new President. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates of the House General reunieron in vain to the house National Národní dům (), located in the district of praguense Smíchov, because the talks had blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice. </seg>
<seg id="519"> No consensus was reached or who is in the General Assembly, tenía right to vote — only representatives or legal también delegates with full powers. </seg>
<seg id="520"> From that moment, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, backed también por the recommendation of the Institute of State and right, according to which the representation por plenos poderes is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Sin embargo, disputes over the electoral code siguen open. </seg>
<seg id="522"> More light on the situation could not shed nor the Executive Committee, in its meetings, ordinary o extraordinary, basically did not solve anything. </seg>
<seg id="523"> The view on the possibility of voting has changed a par times ya, but the worst point sigue siendo. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: what is the easy in the third round para avoid deadlock? </seg>
<seg id="525"> The dispute revolves « about whether to proceed in line with the statutes or find another model, ” says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice - presidents of the FAČR, which, in the direction of the partnership, represents the football profesional. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Según the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate who tenga higher percentage of support in the federation, to which it will present su candidacy. </seg>
<seg id="527"> The region of Moravia is ready to go to a commitment to pueda win the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both total federations. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Bohemia, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations porcentuales, should have the majority of at least two - thirds. </seg>
<seg id="529"> « This quitaría, however, the sense of the two rounds before and deny por complete the concept of system bicameral », as well as Svoboda understands the objections of the morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and votar según applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With that, surprisingly, is also agree Tomaš Paclík, though supposedly the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates should be more Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> I would like to see « votara to agree with the statutes ”. </seg>
<seg id="532"> « Para que did not invent any tontería about representatives as in the last General Assembly », says the owner of Victoria Plzen, postula por primera vez as candidate for accession conducts its observaciones principalmente against Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta sigue siendo optimista. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Según él, in Nymburk se will decide on the new president and él believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate in a constructive manner. </seg>
<seg id="535"> « Todas passions are apaciguarán with the Party of today of our national team in the European Championship. </seg>
<seg id="536"> « Football volverá to be protagonista, and cooperate more comfortable » says the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates tiene more experience in management of football, both at a professional level and regional. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is the more restrained. </seg>
<seg id="538"> I hope that « se to come to an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated. ” </seg>
<seg id="539"> « We are talking about the conflict between bohemios y Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to its own convenience. ” </seg>
<seg id="540"> « This may have resulted in a nuevo blockade of the General Assembly. ” </seg>
<seg id="541"> « Anyway, I hope that it will impose the common ”, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Ya is not a very long time for todas the parties reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations were que realizarse in Montenegro, but who puede saber until it begins the party si the football team will be entirely? </seg>
<seg id="544"> The special plane, in which tuvieron que viajar to Podgorica, among other vice presidents Dalibor Kucera y Rajchl, has not come up this morning by problemas técnicos in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transportar to part of the executive committee at the place where tendrá place the party of classification. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Quizas the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one to be held at the ministerial level, which, according to count, will be held this Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties divided the organisation sporting more powerful of the country to se to reach agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of the football and también the next general assembly of the Central Committee of the Federation of the sport (checoslovaca ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to sport czech tras the financial problems of the home of Sazka lotteries. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík fight for achieving the presidency because it does not find a most suitable candidate. </seg>
<seg id="549"> Si the head of footballers in Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a candidate right that satisficiese todas sus ideas on the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or presentaría as a candidate to a tan relevante. </seg>
<seg id="550"> « Si a persona, would be fighting for it and not introduce me as a candidate for the elections. ” </seg>
<seg id="551"> Pero « until now we have not been able to find a persona, ” said Paclík para the Czech News Agency (ČTK) </seg>
<seg id="552"> What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta y Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR). </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík puntualiza que también, in case vencer evidently remain in the office of President solo until 2013, when they reach the turn of the Ordinary Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In that post, I would like to see an expert and a good manager que is not too closely related to the football events. </seg>
<seg id="555"> « Have already spoken to some people that I could tener into consideration. ” </seg>
<seg id="556"> « Para me was foolish oír some say that at this time, not even want to identify with the czech football. ” </seg>
<seg id="557"> « I would like to change that view », it adds. </seg>
<seg id="558"> What was supposed to be more embarrassing Paclík at this moment is the relationship of Pelta with the chairman of the Football Association Regional Pilsen Berbr Roman, a man with a past controversial, known outside the mundillo as a powerful lobista with ability to influence the vote of the delegates at the General Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="559"> Para Paclík is just not acceptable to Pelta sentado in the chair. </seg>
<seg id="560"> « If it wins, it would maintain the status vigente y nothing in football unchanged ”. </seg>
<seg id="561"> « With the support of Berbra, a business person ambitious, the football sacará even less » Paclík, said. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Also mentioned the fact that a few years ago, the name of Pelta was associated with a telefónica listens during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta salió go unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> I do not know what « prestigio football podría traer victory of Pelta. ” </seg>
<seg id="564"> « Y ojos with what we will look at UEFA and FIFA », said Paclík, which also toma with some caution su statement previous « vendería Club Pilsen si se » Pelta becomes president. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the case of winning elections Thursday, Paclík podría plantearse cooperation with Pelta in the future. </seg>
<seg id="566"> In this opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that terminó in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> « Él (Pelta) would be the first that seguiría ». </seg>
<seg id="568"> « Is quite capable. ” </seg>
<seg id="569"> « I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation ». </seg>
<seg id="570"> Pero « not as manager of a partnership ”. </seg>
<seg id="571"> « Nor do I go the nose where I do not feel able » Paclík added, which in September, suscitó much attention to support the suspension of the Commission referees presidida por Ludek Macel, taken over by Dagmar Damkova. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík admits that it was willing to manage the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Recurre to their management capabilities of private companies, since last summer, is also the director of the Pilsen, which with its support in May the triumph in the first division. </seg>
<seg id="574"> « My strength to change a few things in the area of football and contribute to its practice segura. ” </seg>
<seg id="575"> « Para reducir the influence of some pressure groups, which will probably tienden to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal, producing situaciones unpleasant, said Paclík sin hide their dislike of the President of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> The priorities also sería una of the consolidation of the relationship between the FAČR y the Olympic Committee of the Czech, with the help of which pressure on political leaders to set aside more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="577"> « Is one of the key problems that should dedicate the new President. ” </seg>
<seg id="578"> « Si increase taxes on gambling, as advertised, political parties, to support their arguments, but, frankly, they need to tell us where it ends up todo this money ”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="579"> In addition, Paclík now does not even take account of su partnership with the Club Pilsner, even though he also says that the President of the FAČR must be “ non - partisan ”. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is associated with Jablonec y Rajchl with Dukla of Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> « Is not ideal. ” </seg>
<seg id="582"> I do not see « pero sentido to give hypocritically my actions of the club of Pilsen to another person para then go there after un year and East ”, said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta prometió FAČR nuevos statutes to end the stalemate in the elections. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association uno of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, he promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR tuviera unos nuevos statutes that sirvieran definitely a reason for solucionar, in the future, the controversies on the regulation of elections. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the conflict preelectoral podría move towards a solution today with the possible victoria &apos;s football team. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Ya before the elections not made in September, Pelta prometió focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and to raise funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Decided to take part in the last minute at the last general assembly, which is why this delay of two months I could go either to defend and presentar, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football. </seg>
<seg id="588"> « People from all levels of football ocupa ya long ago and expected to know this Thursday, the new President. ” </seg>
<seg id="589"> « Sienten que the time has come for someone to manage the partnership ”, thinks the man who principalmente associated with the club, but which Jablonice trabajó in Sparta y in the executive committee of the partnership. </seg>
<seg id="590"> This is why, having por suficiente experience to manage the football Czech. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reinaba in the days of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> « Sadly, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes were not as perfectos as all pensaban. ” </seg>
<seg id="593"> Si « we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president ya since September » Pelta, warned. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association se usó to believe will be created para - won the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> « Si presidente elect me, I take this as a challenge, personal y I am ready to respond in the event of this fail. ” </seg>
<seg id="596"> « Is a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist ” Pelta, says. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition, in theory, it tries to engage with his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Ya in the past had warned that it will be working with Henry veía Rajchl, respect por su training in law, being aware that their oponente sería their vicepresidente primer. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Ya had long without attacking Thomas Paclík quien, contrary to Pelta, left no títere with head. </seg>
<seg id="600"> « Takes more than a year in the world of football, and has already had some successes. ” </seg>
<seg id="601"> « Pero vergonzosos y sus attacks were many people quedó sorprendida por the electoral campaign. ” </seg>
<seg id="602"> « Por that many of them have doubts about su verdadero character », told his opositor Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements ya announced in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Su most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from competitions more low so superior. </seg>
<seg id="604"> This should be a showcase of promotion of football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Also, try to « solucionar todos scandals that surgieron because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year. ” </seg>
<seg id="606"> « Immediately after I involve in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money to todo the football ”, said two months ago to the ČTK candidate 46 years. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Then prometió que su appointment as President of the football does not lead to any change personal staff. </seg>
<seg id="608"> « Will que first ascertain the tasks of each employee, he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, it is ruled by a nervousness understandable. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the catastrophic scenarios present vaticinan before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk this Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="610"> « Si the single point of disagreement será how to vote in the third round, as you no doubt we will meet. </seg>
<seg id="611"> « Football needs credibility, which recuperará solo si por un last has leader ”, still two days before the day more decisive in his career representative, Pelta sigue siendo optimista. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promete, that under his leadership, the FAČR start to work with renewed vigour. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Si fourth in the General Assembly sale elected the current vicepresidente Jindrich Rajchl as the new President of the Football Association Czech, a lot of people will be seguramente resentida. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promete que, if elected, trabajaría hard. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Quiere implement a change sistemático y hold members of the executive committee sean responsables in each area of football individually. </seg>
<seg id="616"> También se committed to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for the football and continue with the work started by the former President Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> « As President, I would like to address the full por football ”. </seg>
<seg id="618"> « From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA until the selection, the professional football o the training of young footballers of high performance. ” </seg>
<seg id="619"> « This is not to say that I would do everything solo » Rajchl, said in an interview to the ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> I am a « player team and quiero divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can go to an area specifies. ” </seg>
<seg id="621"> « Asignaré tareas y hard for football can, in each of these, to go forward with a lot of momentum ”. </seg>
<seg id="622"> « For many people this will probably do not seem to like, because it will mean to begin to work very hard and not only criticise the work of others ”, he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement football, it is said to have considered the possibility of not to stand again as a candidate. </seg>
<seg id="624"> « Todos saben, that I am working 20 hours a day. ” </seg>

<seg id="627"> « Se trata have faith to not leave without more, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Según say, it motivates también continue the work already began with Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> « During those two years completed una much of the work that I do not want is now pierda ». </seg>
<seg id="630"> There are « procesos que se had begun and tendrán que su effect within a couple of years, and I would not like someone the pare » preocupado por, announced the fact that if we got to the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could volver such as it was before the era of Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> « I believe in order, and this is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain. </seg>
<seg id="632"> « Detrás it is mainly toda that people who are ocuparía of football grounds for que privilegio para unos only to have a select few. ” </seg>
<seg id="633"> « Se can reprochar un lots of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone. ” </seg>
<seg id="634"> « Trying to be objetivo. ” </seg>
<seg id="635"> « Quiero make a football grounds for todos, because only this sentirán all y not only chosen ”, said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Rechaza también the idea that only seria bohemian President. </seg>
<seg id="637"> « Even though some people are trying to say otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost to Moravia. ” </seg>
<seg id="638"> « Por example, it is time to think to divide the second division in one part czech and in another morava, whose winners will go to the first division ”. </seg>
<seg id="639"> « Does not give the current situation where we have solo tres teams of Moravia, that is a problem for the players Moravians Rajchl young people ”, he said. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Although the battle of the presidential elections to be sumó Tomaš Paclík, president of the Club Rajchl Pilsner, does not believe in their opportunities to be elected. </seg>
<seg id="641"> Yet « siento tener un strong support of the Czech Federation, which I chose as his Vice - President y que sabe que behind me have been some success stories clear ”, said Rajchl, whose éxitos understand savings of a few dozen million kroner contracts desventajosos, contract negotiations televisivos y negotiations on the law of the lottery. </seg>
<seg id="642"> Por otro hand acknowledges its parte of the blame for the Federation not united. </seg>

<seg id="727"> The flag of Schwanzer obtuvo then the Grand Prix of architecture largely on su lightly and floating construction steel - and - glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is considered to have a milestone of contemporary architecture. </seg>

<seg id="730"> With its legendary torre four cylinders para MBW more building adjacent aplanado in Munich, became internationally known. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Su pabellón, designed as a construction temporal para exhibitions se lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten along to the station in the south of Vienna, reformó in 1962 and within se opened un Museum of the 20th century, is called the “ home 20 ”. </seg>
<seg id="732"> The building was adequate pero lacked the space and tecnología correspond to an museum; without any pared para hang art, not a good atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Despite this utilizó until the contemporary art in Vienna un nuevo home. </seg>
<seg id="734"> The building is empty since 2001 and lapses increasingly. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformó the flag, now called it “ home 21 ” y se usará in the future as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>

<seg id="744"> In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was “ a devorador of energy ”, said Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Se changed the profile of the windows of the façade of glass, installed a glass with reforzado insulating glass fibre y se remplazó the glass ceiling por un safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Bridges térmicos y the beams of steel reforzaron o remplazaron y the roofs of asbestos are rehabilitaron. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two sótanos se used to the new uso, a panel of light declined between the house and the street proporciona lighting, a bridge sirve para enter the building almost nuevo, but still the flag of Schwanzer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The doors permanecen external originales, the house is in pintada tonos old species of true mahogany y protegida against oxidación. </seg>
<seg id="749"> Y the cinema is exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> Y todo this with a strict control of the office of monuments and un low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> « Often tenía que find material that is good, cheap and también preferred to the office of protection of monuments », says Krischanitz y warns of a suelo áspero in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, problems and reformas, the building was still more flexible and lighter. </seg>
<seg id="753"> The flag « que vino of Brussels ” has been difficult, said recently, a Krischanitz típica « appearance by chance in the history of the town. ” </seg>
<seg id="754"> Una architecture as well as being “ siempre in all the wrong ” y por « why I want to raise awareness appropriate ”. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, the house is not 21 in the wrong place, has happened un stroke of luck urbanístico. the utterly nuevo y planeado « district of the station central ”, with viviendas y oficinas, sits alongside the Garten Schweizer. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Y tal vez suceda otro stroke of luck: the house 21 podría recibir un refuerzo of another building Krischanitz, because the collecting Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of art temporal berlin y, as oye, negotiate with the city sobre un place vecino in Garten Schweizer. </seg>

<seg id="859"> Seguro que Axel Weber not had thought. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular partida of the summit of the federal bank, in July was known que in 2013 would start in a new, almost equally spectacular trabajo: chairman of the Council &apos;s administrative big swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative paso in his career. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber happy públicamente, praises Switzerland for su beauty and to the UBS por su recién acquired solidez y slipped observaciones friendly noises about sus future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The USB « has achieved a revitalización ». </seg>
<seg id="863"> « I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Grübel ». </seg>
<seg id="864"> In September quedó clear that all sería totalmente different. </seg>
<seg id="865"> Un operador financial USB in London avoided todos security systems of the bank and he let down 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Oswald Grübel, director - general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The President of the Council &apos;s administrative USB se considered since then also tocado, and all preguntaron: when is Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Que se known Weber will advise the bank since February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Y se take over the presidency of the Council administration in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> This is hard to Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsel and has had a periodo adaptation seguramente necessary. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Of blow was in charge of the strategy of a bank, who has just returned to test que deserves the title “ the largest bank in the scandal of Europe ” for some time. </seg>
<seg id="873"> Por una parte, USB is enormous, until recently, was the largest manager of global goods, and, on the other hand, for years, slides a scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, so we think, it saves the past tan orgulloso swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> The beginning of the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The USB tuvo una fame excellent until 2007. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the administrator of goods suizo discreet and sólido, but also cunning, combined with ambitious targets, I also wanted to ser un large numbers in investment banks. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Por una parte, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from clients wealthy que any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> Y por otra parte moved as investment bank in the league of big banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> This impressive. </seg>
<seg id="881"> Hans Geiger, the former banker y posterior profesor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: “ First my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank. ” </seg>
<seg id="882"> « From today &apos;s point of view, one wonders: how could be wrong? ” </seg>
<seg id="883"> It was a big mistake. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In the year 2007 salió to light that something went very wrong in the USB. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director - General, which until then it was regarded as a banker - very intelligent, resigned sorprendentemente. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, it sospechó right. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Fund &apos;s investment bank embarked in losses with titles of high - risk and tuvo que repay billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> Para saddled with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> This para found investors, of course, that some look with contempt until shortly before: a state - owned fund Asia and opaco of Singapore, and a state - owned fund árabe, so discreet, who never had heard su name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> This was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, worsened. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank tuvo que declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, President of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second highest - paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, he continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS se found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and tuvo rescatada por que ser the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The national bank bought valores problemáticos to UBS por many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave seis billions of francs per un obligatoriamente convertible bond, it is becoming copropietaria of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Toda Switzerland was affected, it said, it was this for un país pequeño, if taking in large banks tan. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007, it was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> « We cannot go back to rescue the UBS », said Geiger, an expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The first unió disaster is the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Pocos months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and se showed willing to hand over data of well - heeled customers, which may have disappointed taxes, with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, adopted a number of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from this business with a compensation for pago. </seg>
<seg id="901"> With that, the UBS confessed to more or less have helped in the tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Something that had been simultáneamente perdió su always capital in the competition for customers ricos: the glow of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Tras the scandal, the secret of the swiss bank ya is not the same. </seg>
<seg id="904"> This was followed by the resignation of President of the Management Board and the President of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id="905"> Y the exodus of the funds of clients. </seg>
<seg id="906"> In this way, in a few months, the bank perdió su credibility in their two sectors: plants in investment banking by the erroneous and speculation in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud. </seg>
<seg id="907"> Y fair when they come back to be a little calmer, just when people thought the UBS que volvía to achieve this, it is happening this unhappy history of the operator, a trader individual defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank will realise that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> Y se unveiled, apparently, this is still not working well with the management of risk in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="909"> With the case « Adoboli se says that controls risk have changed too little ”, says Martin thank, a professor of economics and finance at the Corporation Institute at the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The financial director of a large bank german also is sure: “ the problem of the UBS is that it dominates the controls. ” </seg>
<seg id="911"> Por what emerged the idea of caution, with which the bankers suizos se presentaban for some time, be the guardians of the world &apos;s greatest assets: no risk too great, security, on the other hand, the money quiere quebrar on the other side of the Republic Alpine. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Deposits for the safety of swiss banks were the symbol of the reliability and unflinching, y Sprüngli Lindt chocolate genuine. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The heart of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of strong private bank suizo, only is a bit higher. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has su sede principal in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs from the main season directly to the Lake Zurich, embodied by the summits of snow covered in the swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> Here the buildings are ostentosos, rents son unos the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> These include jewellery as Tiffany &apos;s in business tradicionales suizos as the confectionery Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Residen here for years, the swiss banks: from the national bank, via the palace of Credit Suisse, until the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Se comes into the room of receipt of the UBS through a revolving pesada puerta. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are revestidas of marble, in large sillones leather, along with the logo of the bank is a great sign para indicate “ security. ” </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS sabe what the customer is looking for here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> The two big swiss banks, Credit Suisse, UBS y at some point have shifted the idea of big swiss bank, or have betrayed, like the president of a small private bank suizo. </seg>
<seg id="923"> Prefiere not read his name in the paper, after all, like all bankers suizos too, with the business of both big banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS se has become too big, believes, mostly in investment banking, where the Anglo - saxons have gained ground. </seg>
<seg id="925"> There the Swiss had nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> « Y se used for a long time in the customs of the Anglo - saxons. ” </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact, the UBS investment banking changed the Anglo - Saxon, tabled his primera large gain and then came the disaster, no entity european financial tanto had lost money in the jungle of the high risk as the big swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> The 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious. </seg>
<seg id="929"> « Wednesday that the coalition government of the tiny country of seven million decided to rescue the largest exercise in the history of their nation, ” writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book “ Der Crash - UBS » (“ the crash of the UBS » in Spanish). </seg>
<seg id="930"> Politicians granted to 68 billion francs and thousands of approximately 45 billion to save the large bank of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id="931"> ¿You do? </seg>
<seg id="932"> Se talks with bankers suizos, that &apos;s how the problem in the dimension of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three big swiss banks are blending a powerful consortium. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Surge un bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> What sirvió para por que the two different banks precursores of UBS se but: a bank rico pero sleeping with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and una internationalisation poorest pero stronger. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the investment banks internacionalizados arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make rodar una great bicycle financial. </seg>
<seg id="937"> There are two names relacionados with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Association of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then the president of the administrative board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> « Siempre pensé Wuffli y que Ospel were a team » perfecto, says the banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> « Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive que got up from the learning in the bank until the summit. ” </seg>
<seg id="940"> Finally, Ospel se Wuffli trusted what they told them. </seg>
<seg id="941"> In the end, y Wuffli committed probablemente un fatal error: “ Pensó que sus models were a realidad » Geiger, says. </seg>
<seg id="942"> « Is a tragic one. ” </seg>
<seg id="943"> Trágico, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: the attempt came before the case. </seg>
<seg id="945"> The employees of the UBS se remember clearly meetings managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repetía the same slogan: lower the throne to Goldman Sachs. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The bank was the american investment bank, the world &apos;s most powerful. </seg>
<seg id="947"> Leading the “ League Tables », the rankings which then documentaban the success of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> The UBS quería be at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some of the steps he salieron well. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the operations of currency and in the negotiation of action was at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Sin embargo, advisers companies responsible pusieron highlighted a punto weak: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking « fixed income ” compensation, there is a huge amount to the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS tiene vacíos mortgage products in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Para fill the gaps, the UBS started a venture that he was almost cost existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Ávidos growth, invested tanto the same bank as one of its high - risk funds created american investment in high - risk. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Se transformó into a machine poderosa para titularizar mortgage loans and american venderlos then, keeping certain risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Y también, as other banks sought the fall for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="957"> « In the summer of 2007, as the american housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there ”, said Geiger, an expert in banking. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Large tan the euphoria, so profunda the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> Un manager tuvo que go, since the attempt to regulate resultó more complicated than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The UBS se became seats proyectables y insecure son until today. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Currently, who runs a large bank, has a trabajo almost impossible. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Must find a strategy for a bank, in which all the business models are logical perdidos. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Geiger, an expert on banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, to focus on the administration of goods, return to the roots suizas. </seg>
<seg id="964"> The bank does not want to go so far (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> Pero investment banking must reduce much, it is clear now. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world. </seg>
<seg id="967"> In reality, they only pensó in the italian - swiss of 51 years as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank separó sorprendentemente of his predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime, he imposed: it should pass permanently business from UBS, told the bank in Zurich on Tuesday. </seg>

<seg id="970"> Suprime 500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Pero this is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> ¿Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> ¿With what quiere make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that seguro se does Axel Weber today. </seg>

<seg id="1261"> It will be very familiar with these people in the narrative novelística of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae work as their GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of its men and women, is confusing and vulnerable in the fog of war. </seg>

<seg id="1265"> It contains a few notable names are important or famous battles; practically no ambassadors, elegant periodistas o discussions on tácticas o material. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This is not so much a book about what ocurrió explains, as “ a book about how it happened » concerning about “ sentimientos, impressions and experiences, and states of humor. ” </seg>
<seg id="1267"> « The beauty and the pain of the battle « combines experience in times of war more or less 20 men and women ordinarias, on both sides of the war, from colegialas y botánicos to escaladores, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people will become heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some were turned into prisoners of war, otherwise they will lose sus members will be crazy o die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Sus vidas parpadean here as velas votivas lit in a church; nuevos se added to the mix and others apagan. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The book by Mr Englund is a deviation from the history books standard. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It is also a corrective to the notion that the first war world has scarcely was the disastrous trench warfare on the western front. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> « The beauty and the pain of the battle ” se moves of expertly through other teatros of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern, Mesopotamia, Africa &apos;s east. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; one pasa Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tse - tse son un problema intractable. </seg>

<seg id="1282"> Sus se stories have been largely of memoirs, letters and otro material already publicado earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The explanations of their lives pueden ser terrifying o moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, details perdidos, Mr Englund. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them are about hardship and make do with what we have. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> About telling the story of a schoolgirl german says: “ Sucedáneos everywhere sucedáneos ». </seg>

<seg id="1295"> Otras observaciones son about an old Europe disappearing, and on new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> « The conflict has increasingly become a competition economics, ” writes Mr Englund, “ a war between factories ». </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Refleja the arrival of what he called a “ nueva species in the bestiario &apos;s new: the mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with ropas good clothing que implements its carnage while sitting behind a desk ». </seg>

<seg id="1303"> In dozens of small scenes refleja the way in which the war unleashed forces to “ exceptionally uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, revolution social, hatred religioso ». </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People start ask why sus leaders are doing to combat. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as the Great War and the memory of a modern Paul Fussell, or novelas as novedad in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of comprehensive histories. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The volume of Mr Englund se une panteón poco a conventional. </seg>

<seg id="1532"> The walls tienen ojos: how researchers are studying te on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another tipo aireaba que sus puntos sight of anti - immigration in line. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who admitted having conducted a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, we faced its first public judicial hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> While Breivik puede have acted alone, was far from being solo in cyberspace: he spent most of the time that precedió his attack in front of their computers, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support groups right on social networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers querían saber more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> Pero, how do you find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easy - only tienes que go on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> « We realised that it was not too hard to get them ”, says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report sobre populism digital european studies centre british DEMOS. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> The alijo of personal information, Facebook is so enciclopédico, says Bartlett, which the researchers simplemente utilizar the tool publicity for determining their desired demographic characteristics with precision scientific - the way that sellers have been using for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> The team of Bartlett found half a million fan of right - wing groups across Europe, and then I flew announcements, but instead of vincularles to a new band o producto diet, the announcements urging users to complete a survey that preguntaba sobre su educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about su propio future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> To get through Facebook, Bartlett y sus colleagues were able to study to more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 countries in Europe — all without salir of the office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> « Is a whole new way of making a research ”, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not entirely sorprendentes: the supporters in line, right - wing groups tienden to be young men and angry about immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> Sin embargo, in a sort of turn, “ those who combine their activism in line with the activism outside line are more reasonable, more democratic, and less fierce que those quedan behind the computer screen ». </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook se is turning into a new and important tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the place to study everything, from health problems of trends sociales tal expressed in the “ I like to ”, messages on the walls and updates of state. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users, adding un promedio three piezas content per day, the “ supernova of data ” Facebook is creating a boom in the research, boosting the number of jobs that academics with the name of the site in the title until almost 800% in the last five years. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Para some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that te permite study to people who could not acercarte with a file on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> « Before, when intentabas encuestar people with the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify. ” </seg>
<seg id="1551"> « Tendrías que go through of the party, and they would never te permitirían the access ”, says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> « Facebook removes todo - vas to them directly. ” </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Otros say that the site podría proporcionar una way to identify and address the health problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Un recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and sus colleagues, found that the university students who spoke of their exploits of binge on Facebook tenían un riesgo significativamente more have with the drink that students who permanecieron silent on the issue. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno sugiere que colleagues of the students, such as advisers residenciales, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who publique too many updates of State with his drinking. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> « Can &apos;t tratar un problema si no puedes diagnose », said Dimitri Christakis, the co - author of Moreno y director of the health center, behavior and development of the child in the Seattle Children&apos; s Research Institute, told the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> « We have found a way to identify children at risk que would otherwise not be diagnosed. ” </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook también is constantly « pinchando » its own population para obtener data. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The team of data of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine &apos;s Day, the expectation of turnout to half of the legislative period of 2010, and a índice of National Happiness (mainly utilizando information accessible - supporters of the digital freedom for a long time sostienen que the site should make available to other su large amount of data for research). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Sin embargo, users of Facebook saben que the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - slaughtering for poder playing Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the site tu mine personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Pero ¿qué pasa when users of Facebook pasan to form part of a survey that do not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While the researchers have well defined guidelines on how recoger sus data out of line, online is a sweeping free - for - all. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> « Do not believe that many of the users have thought siquiera in the fact that an investigator podría be examining its perfiles », says Neil Selwyn, a sociólogo lab &apos;s knowledge of London, on a study of 2006, which carried out with the walls of Facebook públicos students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> « As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends. ” </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research this siendo completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know que parte information of the profile of a usuario y of the messages of the wall are verdad. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> « What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook son two completely different things, Selwyn » says. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles un y pen siguen siendo the best tools for research that no one can utilizar. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> « No substitute for entering into the real world and speak with the real people ”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> « Social research supone que se is on the social - and a lot of social todavía sucede out of line. ” </seg>
<seg id="1572"> « Frío and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes its primera public appearance in court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to ser the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 personas in Norway this summer, has described himself as a champion of the “ resistance ” during his first public appearance in court in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> « I am a military commander in the resistance movement in norwegian and the Knights of Norway » Templarios, told an sala fills with 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> « I object to the court, as recibió the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology of hatred and porque supports multiculturalism. ” </seg>
<seg id="1576"> « Reconozco facts pero no I plead guilty. ” </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue, because it “ did not want to give Breivik, the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for que stating its views ». </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Por the same token it refused to allow Breivik, which trajo un speech writing in advance, head to the relatives of their victims at the end of the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim también ordenó to the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks more, allowing him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should tener un strict control on all visitors and correspondence for eight semanas. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> Around 30 supervivientes y relatives of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some vinieron with the hope of looking to Breivik in the eyes, others para confirm that we found recluido low key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Todos attended with the aim of making progress towards the conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> I thought « parecía cold and inhumanity ”, said one superviviente of Utoya to ​​noruega broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> « It uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seen and heard the suspect. ” </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Vestido trunks oscuro y se blue tie, Breivik had calmed down and profesional throughout the hearing and looked to journalists and to the survivors in the eye when salió wandered in, the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik to be part of a movement of “ resistencia » higher, the judge ruled that it is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that it acted with accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is possible that some are from que attacks on 22 July parezcan ser obra of an extremist instead of a group of radicals. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Pero that automatically relaxes the pain and confusion that toda una nation still siente. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> I would like to see « pareciera un monster, but it does not appear that », said the family of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> « Sería much easier if the pareciera. ” </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of the interview perdida of Steve Jobs, they are in a theatre this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Tras the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with the Henry Ford - distinguishing the genie of technology as the Great Inventor Moderno. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Pero what the fan of Apple podrían find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recientemente redescubierta that has been dusted in advance of a series of projections special in the biggest markets this week, it is understood how much this creative mind about the processes and trade flows of work of the products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Was certainly a designer, soñador y hippie autorreconocido, but also was a thorough and organizador un yonki diagrams of the flow - a man who believed that many executives sufrían « una disease that is that una big idea is 90% of work … [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product. ” </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series “ the Triumph of the Nerds (the triumph of idiots) on the eve of the computer, and personal sentó for more than an hour with Jobs and una extensive and rara conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been obligado out of Apple, and already trabajaba intensively in its new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a pequeña parte of the interview Cringely se utilizó in Nerds, said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was only after the death of Jobs who se discovered an complete copy on VHS in the garage of a director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This material archive, slightly reeditado, is the basis of Steve Jobs: the interview perdida, 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Para someone known for odiar the in - depth interviews, Jobs sorprendentemente here, it seems willing to give their philosophies tecnológicas y business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Y very pensativo. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Four different throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of observations, where Jobs is considering clearly pensamientos, seeking precisión. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> También there are moments in which too perfectionist of Jobs sale to the surface, where it appears anxious because of the questions of Cringely, empujándole to go faster toward issues o arguments of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Filmed before the age of Pixar, the ipod or the iphone, there is something oddly profético perdida in the interview, when Jobs assesses what it sees que otras companies make good and evil, and offers su propia visión the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> Una thing is to read póstumas assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs who vemos here, the soñador eager to the brink of greatness. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Él tiene una visión of as you can y must be things. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Not long after, to explain everything in detail here, was, and it did. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> Un rápido resumen seven secuencias notable: the interview perdida </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Sobre learned how to wear a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> « Over the years in the business, I always preguntaba: “ ¿por qué things you do? ” and the answers that te give way unchanged son: “ oh, that this is just the way it made ”. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows por qué does what it does, in the business, no one thinks of things very deeply. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> That is what I found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs leads to detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Bemused by the way is registraban costs - often starting with a “ standard ” cost que se did on rough estimates, and which was then covered with a “ variable » - developed a factory automated than claimed that podrían determine the costs of trade to detail. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Sobre the joke of the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs tells the “ blue box ” que él same built with Steve Wozniak, a device that permitía people hackear effectively and telephone company making calls to long - distance away. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Se has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Describes how él y Wozniak probaron box through the use of a phone público, making a so - called, and then conectándose from a red of AT &amp;amp;amp; T to another, while establishing a loop with the largest number of satellites posible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> « We wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and gritabas through the phone público y volvía un - minute later on the telephone público - door side ”, says Jobs with a risita. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> « Éramos young people and what we learnt was that podíamos build something ourselves that podría control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world. ” </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Two, we did not know much, but podíamos build a small thing that podía control a giant thing - it was a lesson incredible, and I do not think that had ever been Apple sin. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs still describing glorious él y que una joke Wozniak almost abandoned, knocking the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and solicitando talk with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As varios members of the catholic hierarchy were named in the middle of the night to speak with the american diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened para go to answer the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Sobre fall in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build a meter of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett on the telephone directory y I made a call. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Poco after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs had a summer job in part - time work in Hewlett - Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> « That was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that he had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well trataban their employees. ” </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Se after Jobs turned in one of the employees of HP que visitaron research laboratories of the company in palo High, where it saw the first « ordenador table never done. ” </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was so big as a suitcase, had a pequeña pantalla catódico of pipe, and I enamoré of him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Get a viaje until HP as an adolescent and perdería time with that machine and I would write programas para. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Sobre improvise innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new productos sobre the march. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Pronto in his career, which is set to be a salesman selling a puñado basis points, asked him un customer si podía todo mount the team. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Trabajando with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and the delivery of the devices finished. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, while I was in Apple, recalls the struggles faced by in the development of a mouse computer: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> « I agree to take dramatic arguments … I shouted que se need five years [for creating a ratón que would cost $300], and I harté y I went outside and found a designer. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Noventa days later, we had a ratón que podíamos built for 15 and that was completely reliable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Sobre large companies perdiendo force: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before that lead the renaissance of Apple, Jobs proféticamente previó the way in which many industry leaders tropezarían in his vision, and perderían control of their market share. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> « Di que trabajas in IBM o Xerox, for what you do best fax machines and printers, and what? ” </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the monopoly of the market share, which is why the company has no more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The increase in sales and marketing success, so they are the kind of people that those returning from por running the business and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the forum for decision - making. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The genius of the products that led to this position of monopoly pudre por fault of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the job is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That is what has happened in Xerox … </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox podría have hijacked the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> Podría have been ten times its tamaño, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s … </seg>
<seg id="1647"> Tomaron defeat of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Sobre innovation as artistic expression: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> « There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product … as it develops the great idea, changing and growing. ” </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Se learns a lot about the subtleties of the same. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> There are sacrificios que tienes que - do some things that you cannot make it to make the electrons, glass makes them, robots do, the factories make them. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> Tienes que 5,000 keep things in your brain - these concepts - adjusted todos at once — </seg>
<seg id="1653"> It all comes back to taste - rebaja exponerte to try to better than a team of human has done, but coming to adapt these things to which tu are doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that the good artists copy, great artists roban. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We have had nunca vergüenza about stealing ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> That in part made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which incidentally were the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Si, were it not for the computer, I could be doing wonderful things in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia y Thomas cenan with rivals in the law of health care while the court accepts the case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day that the Supreme Court se reunió door closed to examine the issue politically controversial whether to accept the challenge to the health care law President Obama &apos;s, two of the justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas y agasajados were at a dinner patrocinada por the signing of lawyers will present the case before the high court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges reunieron in a preliminary hearing para study carefully the requests of review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Uno cases in question was a complaint lodged by 26 states challenging the entire reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for the conservative activists across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed to take the demand and, in fact, we can expect a plea of historic 5 and a half hours to March, and the result will probably will further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the court &apos;s decision was known. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discontinued será probablemente Paul Clement &apos;as Attorney General of US during the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped patrocinar annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been going on for many years devoted to the defence of the legal principles conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Otra signature patrocinó dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Otro patrocinador was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner se held in a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the Court on the case. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican most important in the Senate and un opositor declared the law of health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> ¿The special guests at the dinner? Scalia y Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Is nothing new: the two judges have been watching events in Federalist Society for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Y is not something that is in conflict with the ethical standards. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Si are, it could be said that fall under the code Canon 4C, which it says: “ a judge can attend events to recaudar funds of organisations relacionadas with the law and otras, although the judge cannot be a orador, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event. ” </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Sin embargo, the proximity of absolute Scalia y Thomas to two of the lawyers in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> « This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code is contrary to the demands of several judges who closely follows the court by the same rules that apply to all the judges se federal ”, said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (common cause). </seg>
<seg id="1676"> The judges were « agasajados in a recaudación funds shown with lawyers tienen cases pending before the court. ” </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Su appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event socava any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia y Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that mix too easily the tribunal &apos;s work with the agenda driven by groups such as Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Y &apos;s wife, Ginni Thomas, is a prominent conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Por otra parte, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, that has a ético problema, not Scalia y Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan trabajó as procuradora general of the Obama administration when they were first presented the first legal challenges to the law in the Court of First Instance. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Sus critics have been pushing to que se abstain Kagan of the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law and to now be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan has not given any indication that he is going to do. </seg>

<seg id="1779"> As a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> Un vistazo to the most recent headlines shows us how serios y omnipresentes son deception and lie in everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is occupied by exchanging accusations of sexual harassment, with several women; each side accused of lying to the other. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury por supuestamente ocultar reports that said that un football coach retirado sexualmente was damaging to children. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was “ pillado » with an open microphone claiming the President of the United States, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed países. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> Congressman por nueva exhibicionista York and on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with their denials rápidamente rebatidos por the irrefutable evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of offences in the financing of the campaign relacionadas with the smell of a relationship - marital. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> Y, again, that is what no viviera olvidará never the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton for lying during his mandate segundo about sexual of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Are widespread legends sobre cheating on tests of school and university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> Se have given cases in which teachers have given the responses of exams for students in order to be better vistos in their assessments of performance. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentores que should be taught to the contrary are sending the message that lie and cheat son acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> ¿Deception, how much are we? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> On an ordinary day, studies show that te pueden lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> That is for sure, many of these lies are white lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Otro study showed that the unknown mentían tres veces in the first 10 minutes of getting to know. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Detecting lies, or “ the location of lies&apos; skill, is an essential that we must acquire all, for reasons tanto personales as professionals. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is crying out: “ you tengo », the detection of deception be lost knowledge seria based on scientific data obtenidos during the last six decades in prestigious universidades que realizaron proyectos of in - depth investigation, especially posts in psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> Uno of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The liars sí look in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Not always tartamudean, stuttering out, ruborizan o feel uneasy. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> It cannot be concluded tampoco que liars sean difficult to detect or expose. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> Un detector lies trained puede come to learn the truth about the structure of the statement, the expressions microfaciales, training of questions and the times. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> Pasé varios years sondeando discoveries scientists on the deception in the vast y siempre emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a technique which is easy to learn and to help navigate nuestro complex world - especially if sus responsabilidades profesionales include recruitment, interviews, and the management of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The good liars tienen the ability to read well to the other, making them sentir at ease, handling sus propias emotions and sintiendo intuitively how others perceive them. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Sabemos por investigations that the extrovertidos lie more introverted, men say more “ lies orientadas to itself ”, while women say more lies « orientadas towards the rest ” — normal way for proteger feelings of someone — que married people lie less frequently to their partners que people who are not married (but the lies that suelen say tienden to be “ enormous). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> También sabemos que si usted is seen as a perpetrator, the others were sentirán less guilty the deception. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> ¿How saber si someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> Primero, it appeared the usual conduct charge. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> It &apos;s called “ creating a line of base ”. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Help to provide puntos benchmarks to measure after the changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the position of the person, risa y feature vocal. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> It is best I can usually golpetea si someone with the foot todo the time for not making accusations unfair when will see the foot golpeteando in half of the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Next, look for groups of deceptive behavior, verbales y non - verbal. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these groups of behaviour as hard alarm, not as evidence of deception. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> The people who cheat pueden freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember su history, can point sus pies for the door, lean towards a salida, change its stance significantly o display a « comfort postentrevista » — that exaggerated suspiro of relief, and change of position que una vez todas difficult questions have been completed. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Often the interrogators makes out falsely que solo para has ended the interview that seek relief postentrevista. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> También presta attention to the vocabulary of the person. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> Scott Peterson got its foot until the fund and usó said that while the past tense su wife murdered was viva, launching a search of it on a national level. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The people who cheat también pueden usar un distanciador language: “ I had no relaciones sexuales with this woman … Miss Lewinsky » o repetir una pregunta íntegramente difficult. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The indicators verbales more common sutiles. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Can someone usar un pile of “ language restrictivo » when replied to a question difficult: “ Well … to tell the truth … so what I se … in my opinion. ” </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This means that the answer is una percepción instead of a fact, and it is often a señal warning. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These skills, improve the chances of any for avoiding being victimizados por artists of the scam in their careers and personal lives. </seg>

<seg id="2088"> We make sure we cannot be too tour porque is easy to fall into the hands of the large crowds of people who loves y tu music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as one recuerde que people is there for the music, that te recuerde que Thou respetar music and what the trajo, without encapricharse por un ser ser famous and rock star, something that none of it we are interested in. </seg>

<seg id="2106"> I think that all of us always we were all a bit disconnected from the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana y todas which surgieron at the same time, and, if there are relevancia now, I think that is something wonderful because it is music they vale worth listening to and gangs as Mudhoney are now doing better music they nunca. </seg>

<seg id="2111"> With both, when Ed tocó, I cried when I heard and son songs profundamente oscuras. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when there is any more y trauma in your lives and se pierde to a relative or friend un, these things are starting to influence tu tu art and music, and these two songs, without a doubt, is that for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> También, I think it can be ser una persona happy and still be able to music they sea oscura. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> ¿Parque o mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects coincide in the opportunity of the call beyond polemics sobre fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The contest municipal sobre 16 puertas reabre the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Amediados of 80, at the height of the now defunct Corporation metropolitan Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed unos pasquines promotion Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The leaflet defined the mountain as the great parque of the Barcelona Metropolitan. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> What is more, they attached a comparison figures, with the Central Park New Yorker. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park volvió to be placed in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not geared to the north - south axis sino - down mountain (above) (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The rating of Collserola as parque natural redunda on this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> The reference ya Central Park was not sino Yellowstone, with jabalís in the role of the bear Yogi. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 competitions for otras tantas puertas access to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Una puerta remite to the idea for the theme park, without a doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> O that or someone pretende poner puertas to the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question sale sola: Collserola, parque o mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The competition, both for its vertiente merely organizativa and what it means for reflection on the city is the topic of conversation between all the architects people of Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is now almost un tema recurrente to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected se reconocen in a lift. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Y this leads, quite rightly, to one of the few similarities between what tres architects people of Barcelona, and profesores universitarios, that it has been. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol y Marta Bayonne: the contest is timely. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Para Roldán, having dealt with the coastline « se is necessary ” to discuss « the mountain ”, while the speech Ildefons Cerdà, apples verdes, has not been carried out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> « Partir is on the basis that the park more extensive Barcelona is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things by their great accessibility. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex », according to the architect para quien the title of “ puertas of Collserola » contains a « trampa léxica »: we must not think of “ as the entrance to a theme park, but the demarcation of zonas where we need to act. ” </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Mòdol, as Roldán y Bayonne with experience in the world urbanístico, called the proposal “ reto intellectual » with “ certain risk ». </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Peligros derived from “ uncertain that is today proyectar public space » tras experience in the 1980s, and que tuvo in the area of the Fòrum « su swan ». </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first temor is the very definition of borders where they can build. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> « Limit something is already setting the next step, which is to say, its » sobrepaso. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> « We need to think of new instruments urbanísticos, planning, because the current [in reference to the plan General Metropolitan (PGM)] pueden lead to real disasters ». </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Leaner to the question, Mòdol opina que, simplifying, the alaskan vallesana of Collserola « puede understood, the park as a Barcelona, no ”, a point merely topográfica. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Mòdol recuerda que ya there is a trabajo made by Patronat of Collserola que « must not fall on deaf ears », while grateful for the opportunity that the City ofrece his body to intervene in this project « from the first moment. ” </seg>
<seg id="2215"> Y even more, he understands that the closeness of the mountain in the city is the salvoconducto que permite architects to enter the debate, but “ doubt ” sobre si is this profile técnico must lead the disciplinary teams (“ everything right, un » points) have had to create: “ the architects should be solo una tool ”. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayonne insinuated that the answer to the question that gives título to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the contest is a lack of global visión Collserola: “ you have called 16 contests transversales - says - mountain - sea, but there is no reading longitudinal, look at y understands the area as a whole. ” </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This causes, at least in its case, which has opted for participar in 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, a project for una doors puede clash in programa y definition of the architect of the door. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion, the city should ensure that the lower the Round Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that making a suave transición between the city and the verde. </seg>

<seg id="2267"> MSS announces protocolo para obesity gene find </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The Social una investigation to find out the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported in specialists from the IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that runs a research to find the gene of obesity in children and young people, so - called protocolo « genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence », which will have markers associated to overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In a statement, the head of the unity of medical research in biochemistry Hospital of specialities Medical Center of the National Siglo 21st century, Cross Miguel Lopez, explained that they were integrated un multi - disciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutriólogos y trabajadoras sociales. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> That team is supported by specialists and students graduate from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and of the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) Institute &apos;s National Politécnico (IPN.) </seg>
<seg id="2272"> In research to be invited to participate in which the public is not o derechohabiente, go to the units of the sporting participantes IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where it is carried out tests to minors, all Saturdays from 8: 00 a. m. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Stressed that the protocol began in the unit sporting Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, it is carried out in Unity State of Mexico sporting Nezahualcóyolt (East). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Una vez que se complies with the aim of bringing 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the unit sporting independence (south Federal District) and finally in unity sporting Morelos (north of the federal district). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify mexican risk factors for prevenir the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> The held this November 14 World of diabetes, specified que the aim is to raise to three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervisión of their parents, for the application of questionnaires specific food. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> También se asking sobre physical activity and background heredofamiliares diseases, with the aim of preventing risk factors that triggered padecimientos as diabetes or kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Detailed que se Saturdays applies to all participants measurements antropométricas (peso, talla, waist circumference of), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, cholesterol levels, triglycerides and insulin y genetic (seeks to identify gene associated with child obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz Lopez señaló que obedece this research to the concern of the professional health by the alarming increase in weight in the minors. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> « Surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 señalaron que in just six years, there was an increase in the case of children, from 77 percent in obesidad, and girls of 47%; overweight también se observó un dramatic rise », underlined the specialist in IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He indicated that the justification for the search of the markers se sustenta in which the country &apos;s population differs from other por su genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Reported that on average, the Mexican tiene 65% of american indian heritage, 30% and 5% Africa and this condition is refleja in gene associated with diabetes, and excess weight. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is the inability to traduce burning the excess of energy we use (calories) and stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which enables it to detect if presentan some overweight u obesidad. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Even, he said, the presence of pliegues color obscuro (acantosis) in neck and antebrazo, which indicate the likelihood that padezca metabolic disorders y until prediabetes. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information will be handled on a confidential basis, the doctors give por writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and changes in the way of life that should make to prevenir diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components que cause sobrepeso, obesity and chronic otros padecimientos: sedentary, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain the most part of the day sitting in front of the television or utilizar means of transport instead of walking short distances. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> También se due to the high calorie intake, that is to say, the greater consumption of drinks azucaradas, carbohidratos (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, and so on) with high in fats and proteínas y the genetics being considered in this protocol. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM avoid potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a senior researcher at the chemistry of the UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polímeros para producir una mixed with better performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature </seg>
<seg id="2291"> Si the signals that sends the pavement were met, it would not require repairing potholes about $200 each season of rain in the area Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Nájera Herrera, a senior researcher at the power of chemistry (FQ) UNAM si, who ensured that the process of building and maintaining a pavimento asfáltico is the right one, the cracks podrían reducirse in quantity or, indeed, be completely removed. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In its Conference an opinión tecnológica of potholes, handed down in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, made it known that the laboratory to his office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros para producir una mixed with semejantes characteristics to the tarmac, but with a greater resistance mechanics, both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of asfaltos modified podrían utilizarse in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the training of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt, the main bulk of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, high - molecular peso, called asfaltenos, and other low - weight, so - called molecular maltenos that together they give to pavimento su characteristic viscoelástico behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> The behaviour of the viscoelástico asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to the 180 degrees, acts as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade su viscosidad is extremely high, and to 50 degrees centigrade presenta un state almost sólido, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt se vuelve quebradizo, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but rather we are going changing during the day, according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in engineering química. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The investigator &apos;s FQ observó que the streets of Mexico City in its majority are covered by pavimento flexible, which is made up of six layers of materials, including the last three involving the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the more superficial se the file tar, shaped by pequeñas piedras bathed in asphalt and then compactadas. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each of the piedritas que is the file, pointed out, is stained with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> The transitar vehicles and generated efforts, this permite que forces spread very well on the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> Si se tratara asphalt amended se difundirían even better, felt the engineer químico. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> The file sobre tar, he is a veritable última layer called file rolling, which is made of a material of stone fine, which is to say, a sand that también se washes in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> As this is the layer that va to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, must have more mechanical than the file tar y proporcionar friction in the way. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> As part of the pavimento que va to receive and disseminate the efforts, the file rolling requiere also have the thickness and appropriate se must take care of the material is made. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, in particular the water, he said, because it affects considerably to the performance of the file tar. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> When the field was humedece, water in the interior of the file and it is difficult for salga, it causes un reblandecimiento of all sections of the pavimento y, therefore, the training of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> In the process of forming a pothole, he said, is the first to wear the film of rodamiento y sólo then it affects the file tar, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with appropriate programas of maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Who is also a member of the system &apos;s National researchers explained that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the training of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of pavimento must always be in connection with the vehicular burden y to ensure that it complied with, to avoid potholes are often. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and trabajar sobre the asphalt, for example, emulsiones tar, which in other countries ya se are even in the market and permiten reparar the cracks easily and at no need to use high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> ¿What he came to the candidate of the Valle para ser the new señorita Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors which incidieron para que Melina Ramírez Serna did not achieve the crown of señorita Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> The Valle recibe su título número 14 princesa. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> The Valley Cauca se queda with the appetite for the crown of señorita Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time Melina Ramírez Serna tuvo que se shape with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the group who the show as a new princesa of Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the reins, the department ya suma 14 títulos of princesa Melina un y se the legion of women vallecaucanas que have been close to the crown pero que were proclamas princesas including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Elizabeth Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> Today, the big question is how many are doing what was lacking? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Porque the outcome represents the defeat of a great favourite que in each presentación showed that she had todo para ser the new señorita Colombia, not in vain was elected as Queen of the Police y Better Face Jolie of Vogue, que obtuvieron reinas as Taliana Natalia Vargas o Navarro quien se led the crown of señorita Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor that is considered key to the decision taken by the jury to appoint its members primera princesa radica in which not impressed with its response to the question “ what is this book that te has marked by y por qué? made by Martín Gómez Murillo, the cart literary Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The interrrogante the vallecaucana respondió: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> « Leo, I find it quite a lot in the literature, I believe it is a form of culturalizarse definitely, I believe that the book that I marked childhood is “ the principito », the book is quite serious. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Currently I read “ crime and punishment ”, is a book of world literature que todos must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, one Russian, a book called “ beautiful que se the heat of ». ” </seg>
<seg id="2322"> Una respuesta poco primero por que liked the term “ culturalizarse » y segundo por not to explain in a particular how each of the books that have cited the set. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Pero at the end of the ceremony, said Melina sentirse tranquila y happy with the result « the universe is wise pasa what pasar. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> Para toda y people, please read un poquito, “ the principito » is a great book ” </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among the scenarios launched se says that the Valle quemó favouritism. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Un periodista bogotano hinted that the preferred, the ovacionada y the woman candidate who came wearing a todos prizes preliminares (reto of gastronomy Oster, vote from the public about the best traje artisanal, and Queen Mother), “ that was the jealousy of the other candidates, estresó Queen y por that shone in the scenario ”. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> This is y notó in her first speech in bathing in the beach &apos;s Hilton y sus two parades in the evening of coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> But in both lució segura, notó que lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena y Atlantic sí showed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the “ at home ”, as the channel RCN opinó que the fact that Melina appointed princesa « notes that the candidate, more premios wins during the contest is not as reina ». </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle se showed the last very elusive, with the press, and that is where we are wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Otra hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury sobre su interest in social work, which is in últimas, the essence of the National beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Por something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to social needs of its pais. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> « Beauty sola is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and social focus in your sensitivity, which before entering the contest are involved in projects », explained. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> También se speculation that Valle pecó por sus flaws in the derriere fibrosis y que se I noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory pues precisamente the jury chose as the candidate « beauty natural ” with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical trabajo responsable. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The preparador of Hernán reinas Jorge Orozco reconoce que Melina was not the best body, which had better, “ but su problema of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for my was not highly visible, I fell puntos on the last day. ” </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the surgeries que se practicó. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> « The surgeries are fine, but it is not the Valle supo do. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Su body nunca was his strong and here is the claimed ». </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Por this prize, which for the first time released the contest &apos;s National Bold, after the parade in bathing surgió cruel vaticinio que un last night he performed, he said that this was the contentillo que Raymundo denied to Melina para not to give them a taste of the krona. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Realidad o not, the fact is that from today Melina begins year reign, not as soberana, but as princesa, a position that it offers the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the competitions in international &apos;s own National nomination contest. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Sin embargo, she pasará in history as one of the reinas que despite its overwhelming paso por Cartagena, he was elusive crown. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Such was the work of the caleño que identified the dead body of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Un lofoscopista of Cali pasó in history as the man who confirmed the death of “ Alfonso Cano ». </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is key. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On 4 November, a lofoscopista CTI &apos;s Cali pasó in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum: “ the Farc leader Alfonso Cano », through the comparison of their fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven lofoscopistas que working in the seccional of CTI, this week was coming up the “ availability » to Eliazar González, a man of Puerto tejada que leads 21 years working in the area of judicial inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> To start his career, González trabajó in municipalities in Chocó, where many times tuvo que stops on more than five days in the jungle para come to the site in which the bodies were to be identified. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In the 2000 trasladó to the capital of the Valle and then to carry out the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, namely, palms of of the hands and feet. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him that carried ropa tres minimum for days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big is expected. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> On Friday night the Cauca salió para in a helicopter from Palmira. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> Sabía que had to identify two bodies and que se sospechaba que uno of them was the man who ran the guerrillas world &apos;s oldest, for which he was asked to carry the card decadactilar of Guillermo León Sáenz verdadero (his name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Sin embargo, when it came to the research team to the site in which it found the corpse not recognised por su physical aspect, since it was very different to that had seen in the media. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> There were, beard, dressed like a farmer in the area, without glasses and a lot thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Pero fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, tinta, a transplantador y una glimmering lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the card. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> Su ojo not ruled: “ Alfonso Cano ». </seg>
<seg id="2358"> That same night, the man oriundo Puerto tejada was confirm to the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzon, se trataba the maximum, head of the Farc. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In search of the footprint </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Para un dactiloscopista of Sijín of Cali recognition that did the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference por operational against “ Cano », it is very significant. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Not many people are aware of our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The dactiloscopia is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support inquiries by y theft crimes such as murder and confirm the identity of the people caught. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they are caught, many criminals are bonds false or have no papers. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We will take the fingerprinting y the seek in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The investigator told us that, in a case of theft, it was quitar un pedazo wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported his power to take strong una box full of jewellery and money. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> « The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate for superficies sacar una fingerprinting, but in that case pudimos obtener the footprint of the entire and identify the offender, who had participated in various » petty theft, recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints también pueden dismiss o reafirmar sospechosos in cases of murder. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently found a man dead, with bottles of liquor around her. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> Por half of the research found that un family podría ser sospechoso of crime and, effectively, a footprint in the bottle clashed. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> While this does not guarantee that has been the killer, they ubica at the scene of the crime. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> Un dactiloscopista of CTI explained that in the objects « fingerprints would be sacan with reactivos químicos o physical ». </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they occur, they use transplantador un o tape in order to lift it. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After that, the perceptions are sent to the Asif, which is the basis of delinquency data, or the Registraduría. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> « The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented ”, said the expert of CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> Clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme, CSI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As well as not everything that is gold shines, not everything that is toca se vuelve footprint. </seg>

<seg id="2458"> The CDU propone elect the President european sufragio universal </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has taken place without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and presidenta Party &apos;s Christian Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> Initially had not been included in the order of the day, the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular for satisfacer to militants who believe that the government &apos;s policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and podría serlo in a future with the Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted prácticamente por unanimidad. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Of 1.001 delegates, only se registraron nueve votos against and 10 abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation of several minutes that won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and after hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, europhile cleared out any possible doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main thrust of the Chancellor, and of the motion, resumen in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ” </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe is peace, but also because « nueve million jobs depend directly on the euro. ” </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Para Chancellor, “ the time has come to lead the way in Europe. ” </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon in order to grant reforzar control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but I could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission for sufragio universal para « making it a reality to Europe. ” </seg>
<seg id="2468"> In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Sin doubt, it is improbable for 27 to arrive quickly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain hostile to him y leaders of the CDU parecen saber que Nicolas Sarkozy also. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> Pero the ball on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Por otro side, the delegates have rejected por una overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank in terms of weight of each economy, which obviously reforzaría Germany &apos;s weight. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Eager to calm down on the inside of her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is seeking to win his Congress at the expense of the “ small ” países or european countries in difficulties prepared to criticise the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of “ friendship Franco - german », Angela Merkel has not - discussed to France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Salvo in passing. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Recordando que, two centuries ago, there was a sangrienta battle in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating for the army defeats Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> The incidence of fraud in the sick leave </seg>
<seg id="2478"> Tras subsidies, the UMP and the government taking up ofensiva against sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux para visitar una box responsable subsidies and family pronunciar un speech on the subject, as recurrente since 2007, the fight against the social fraud y the ayudantía. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> In addition, to accompany tal ofensiva, that part of the desire to save a rigorous, but still recuerda an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First of all, for cuts presupuestarios: the government plans to impose private sector workers un fourth day of lack of power before taking the low. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In short, unless there is a convention of company specific, a worker falls ill que perdería four days of pay, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> Se trata a measure that could stir up a oleada of anger but one that can allow save 280 billion, according to Les Echos. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure to a more symbolic: imposing officials un day, remuneración in case of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> As we discuss these issues, most vuelve to putting on the table is also the subject of the fraud, this time orientado towards the abuses of the low labour. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> « Van will substantially increase the controls and, in addition, if discovered someone committing a fraud, must reimburse the sums », warned Xavier Bertrand talking in the RTL on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the announcement parecen slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of low labour. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> In fact, since 2002 realiza un seguimiento constant in this matter and have launched several ofensivas políticas que, normally have borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are ill more than in the rest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Look carefully, first, the national figures. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> Según the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 was paid more than EUR 237 million entitlement por low labour. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Según the French Institute for Research and documentation of the economy &apos;s health, subsidies for low representaron, in 2008, 5% of health spending, rising to 11.300 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this sum, 46% up to maternity and por industrial accidents, while 54% is connected with the sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Por, 2.5% of spending on health. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010, the French have taken una average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group soul Consulting. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> Una half that, without a doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the syrian professional management Monster. com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 french employees surveyed said that they had not taken a single day of sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Otro study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the sick leave tuvieron una less than eight days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Si compared with our european neighbours, french workers are not more likely than in other areas to get sick leave. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> Un long study in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall lack of work (both in razones health and other oscilaba), in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to a 20% and a 28% in Denmark, a 15% Kingdom and between a 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> The fraud is un - fairly limited. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of the sick leave of more than 45 few days will be sistemáticos. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in a 13% of the 285.000 realizados, that the low short - term were “ unjustified o » too long, which is to say, 37.050 cases. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were “ properly tailored o unjustified; a figure, taking in transactions un total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Por, makes a total of 169.000 cases unjustified » between several millions of workers that they took a sickness. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> Sin doubt, a figure insignificant in comparison with, for example, the work in the black. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Según the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, the practice representaría unas pérdidas income tax of 9 - 15 billion euros per year, which is more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, no doubt, considerably more than the fraud in the latter. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> Papadémos: Greece must implement a new plan of adjustment </seg>
<seg id="2509"> Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to fix its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> This is what declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament, he added, too, that the 100 days have given its government union would be sufficient to achieve that goal. </seg>

<seg id="2512"> The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the “ principal tarea » of the new government, because “ in play ” is the continuation of the country in the euro zone, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> As a result, Papadémos has provided that the public deficit in the country are reducirá « until around 9% ” of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching a 10,6% in 2010 and un 15.7% in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> The right - wing rechaza nuevas austerity measures </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Antonis Samaras, the leader of the group, showed on Monday their support for the measures already adopted for trying to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his partido will not commit to additional austerity measures. </seg>

<seg id="2525"> This committee recomienda on the government to amend the penal code in a way which permits assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient plantea y this option has been tried competent to take the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> Para start, experts details a recent poll by the Economist Intelligence unit que compared the quality of the death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada is the tenth puesto, the study notes that « medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death ”. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> With medication or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Y, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians wish to die at home, the 68,6% of them just die in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> As a whole, the highest rate in this sense the registra Quebec, where a 86% of casualties occur in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and the suicide attended, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it wants to amend the penal code in connection with the euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Sin embargo, according to the experts, who also have studied the situation in all the countries where such practices have been legalized o does not constitute a criminal offence, there is no proof that the fact that there are not considered a criminal offence has not led to a abuse of its implementation, that is, the use of euthanasia and the suicide seen with people not competent or que had not given their consent. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Jocelyn Downie, co - author of the report, said yesterday by teleconferencia que, on the contrary, more observaban excesses in those countries that have not been legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> « In Canada practica euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal ”. </seg>

<seg id="2538"> In addition, 66% believes that the fact of legalising euthanasia will not to understand that people &apos;s lives are elderly or disabled tiene less value. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As for the people who have assisted suicide, 41% of respondents opina que should not open a proceso against them. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> In addition, between its recomendaciones sugieren que se listed on the criminal code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The panel of experts pide also formed to healthcare professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rechace care at the end of their lives without fear of facing a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In terms of palliative care, the committee reclama que governments, institutions of health care and the doctors are working together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Por último, in connection with sedation paliativa o terminal. it is already employed at length in the health institutions of Canada, the committee pide que, except that sirva para reducir the physical pain, should be considered as euthanasia and se someta the same procedures. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> Experts say reservas otros </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Otros experts in the field of the right health ya have expressed their reservations in connection with the conclusions of the report by experts from the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in right of health, has described as “ extreme » the position of the experts who concluded the report, among other things, because not only the practice of euthanasia to patients in terminal decline. </seg>

<seg id="2684"> At the same time, must be filled the increasing scarcity of resources fossil fuels in order also to seguir produciendo electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Por this, Germany permanece sola in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its way to the need to find a source capable of replacing or Switzerland, which only tiene por objetivo power stations built in the last generation. </seg>

<seg id="2721"> In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guidance declaring in 1976 which « 900 unemployed should not be a problema para que un país has almost two million workers immigrants ”, while on the left, it set the tone, Michel Rocard, explaining that France “ cannot take charge for the misery of the world ” in 1990. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference, the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, both the left and the right who shared the fear of the invasion of the territory national una multitude of polish plumbers. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> On both sides, and it is felt that immigrants are a burden for the economy and society in France. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they operate with regard to immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme, François Hollande se confined to include trivia, indicating that the co - development permitirá solucionar “ problema of migration ”. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps resulta rentable electorally, but economically sale very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Tal as economists Ian Goldin y Geoffrey Cameron on a building site reciente que resume knowledge most recent immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists in the positive impact of the migratory flows in economic growth, the wage and employment in the countries that receive immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limitation of immigration perjudica weakens growth and employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears relating to the impact of the immigrants are based on the idea that these can sustituir for national workers, in particular the poorly skilled, by pressing to que se reduzcan sus salarios. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Pero experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are more complementary sustitutos of workers and national exercise principalmente profesiones in sectors with the lack of jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Immigrants poco qualified trabajan in sectors that do not attract workers and more skilled in sectors where the dynamic training does not meet the demand of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Un positive effect on salaries </seg>
<seg id="2734"> In the same way that a surgeon tendría difficulty working one that will be lack of anestesistas, complementarity between national and immigrants provoca que the arrival of the past have an impact on wages and the use of the national. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Teniendo all this in mind, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase of migratory flows presents una subida in real wages in the long - term of between 0.6 un y 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Y, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants are making contributes to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (there is a large share Nobel Prize y naturalized american companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay y Yahoo was founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants also son net contributors to the social systems, since they bring to a 1% of the total budget in european countries. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates that, for example, in Germany by immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years realizará una contribution net income (less) expenses of EUR 150 public budgets on average during his lifetime. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that he lacked « teeth ». </seg>
<seg id="2740"> These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, only you need to think in a european democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious thing, but also fragile. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The european continent should be able to remember this, even though it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarismos, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some might think that, for democracy triunfase definitely sobre sus enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way to posible. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Sabemos, from Napoleon « the Petit », that it was in mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The universal suffrage, although this is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and could even become a “ tool of oppression » said, formerly the philosopher republicano Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, the democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation un y control a separation of powers, an education, Luces, solidarity economic and social justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is on the verge of becoming a political crisis and democratic. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The greek referendum palinodia verdadero - false tuvo, in this regard, a dual effect revelador: it showed the need of a return of the political sphere potente, but also the worrying sensación of its failure, their inconsistency. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> To consider this ambivalence para superarla. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle have now been moved, and que, in many cases, the soldiers republicanos ya not moving in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We will not come out to gain if we demand a sucesión national referendums, organized on the basis of the needs and in disarray. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Una blank cheque to the monarch european all or un high into the void of the hole nationalist: what opciones para the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want to drive coups effect, but a joint exercise, full, calm and steady, choices and democracy, this time at european level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, have no idea where to end the list), because only there is a crisis, Europe &apos;s crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> The whole of Europe is the pliega on the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which already suffering from su su impotence and lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe that suffers una humiliation in the international arena. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe which is the great loser slowly sovereignty and, with it, each of their nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The most urgent is that popular sovereignty recupere over the helm of the european project. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Porque únicamente together can they Europeans reducir the weight of its debts, freed from the markets and preparar su future through investment. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The way out of the crisis requerirá decisions at european level that cannot be taken sin una democratic legitimacy, except that total sea para lead to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> Tras have long struggled against this proposal for the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all calling for a european economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Que. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Pero pensar in it without una greater political integration and democratic - without the vivida as such by the citizens, it would be a nueva madness and will lead a new died. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take a new stage of european integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> Para build the Republic in France, was necessary « republicanos do ”. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution is motivated by interests would not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This lesson sigue siendo applicable. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We need to build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Únicamente se podrá achieve building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real soberanía popular european. </seg>

<seg id="2802"> The investigation into the kidnapping of two frenchmen in Niger last January have reanudado the gateways. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Raptados in a restaurant in Niamey por personas relacionadas with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour y Vincent Delory died the next day, along with several of its secuestradores following an operation launched by french special forces. </seg>

<seg id="2806"> The study indicates calls made to several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> Según radio France Internationale (RFI), numbers embezzled especially the interest of the researchers: one leads to a nigerian que permaneció for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, presumably, is close to Aqmi y to the sect. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> « Se trata progress, but certainly we must expect to have more formal pruebas before talk of operational cooperation between Aqmi y Boko Haram ». </seg>
<seg id="2809"> Pero « is possible ”. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> « We know for years that the sect enjoys financial support and intellectual and is becoming increasingly active ”, says Kunle Amuwo, a researcher in Nigeria. </seg>

<seg id="2822"> Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested in life, receives the death in prison. </seg>

<seg id="2833"> Listening to the republican candidates para presidential, voters podrían pensar que is as well. </seg>

<seg id="2835"> Se spread mottos, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, the aid to Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the “ Grand Old Party », has threatened to lead to the Chinese to the WTO and denouncing them « por manipulation of its currency », a key issue in an exasperated America por the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> DA if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to Obama in China and the only candidate that posee una visión sofisticada of foreign policy, is nearly drowns in an attitude that « apabulla » emotions. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> He asked for a firm, but a constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> Pero Huntsman, that it falls flat in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> In the style of Reagan </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Romney también has promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> « Si salgo elected to go to Iran, ” fanfarroneó. </seg>

<seg id="2851"> Opponents of the current President Reagan told that simple ideas y que también tenía won the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Recuerdan que Obama himself was an amateur and que tuvo que loosen the pistón in the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="2853"> They insist, rightly, on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, at the exit of the “ boys precipitada » of Iraq and in their tergiversaciones in Libya, and labeled as weak. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> Pero attacks are not sencillos. </seg>
<seg id="2855"> The population of judges in a way rather positivo the balance sheet of national security of Obama, who finished with Bin Laden. </seg>
<seg id="2856"> In Iraq, is wary of the military interventions which generate a collapse. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, New puerta entry of russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which communicates directly with Western Europe Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is already has put into service. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> Must supply gas for the needs of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event, with great pomp. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra un y sensitive bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, the new communicates directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Simbólicamente, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the french prime minister François Fillon y su counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have been together the steering wheel of the heart valve que controls the entry of russian gas in the network of Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> With this new pipeline, each year will reach 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas to Western Europe additional through a first tuvo of 1.224 km to communicate the St Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg - Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> Un segundo tubo should be completed by the end of 2012 permitirá suministrar un total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is to say, enough to cover all the french consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> In addition, are already talking about the possibility of building a tercer tubo por the same recorrido. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> Para Gazprom on time, the completion of this enormous building site presenta redolent of victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Poland and the baltic countries will had fought firmly to the project. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> In fact, the Nord Stream va to allow suministrar gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course terrestre por terceros países (Poland and Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> Suddenly, these two countries pierden something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia amenazándola shut with access to the markets of western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate in comparing the Nord Stream as a “ nuevo pacto german - soviet », in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin para ocupar Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> That is, if the issue is politically sensitive. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe, support the project ruso, has obtained a greater security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> Pero price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between the Eastern and western Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has managed in just five years, ensuring the victory su visión of an alliance between Russia and wealthy western countries, big consumers and gas reserves in increasingly limited. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> « This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery que unites us organically », François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the pipeline, showing how the big contracts sector gas are tan políticos as economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> This explains the broad todo sonrisas on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of the pipeline will also supone un technical achievement. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The handset submarino is made of steel recubierto of cement for protegerlo against the anchors of the ships. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Se supports at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 metres. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Para build it, it was necessary to avoid areas of mines that date back to the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> « It necessary to withdraw o destroy a hundred of them, by precaución », says Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> Also, it was necessary to step up measures to protect the flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The handset is a long serpiente of metal that pesa as 242 torres Eiffel and is not interrupted in all its length: or válvulas, or by station maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> Scheduled una plataforma control in the waters of Sweden, but leaders of the project to the same renunciaron to see that the swedes were not very willing allowing a sociedad Russian State se established permanently in the sea off the coast. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> « In case of outages, stop the passage of gas in less than a minute ”, precise Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline was released, therefore, to the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Pero manufacturers see poco probable que se produzca una flight, as planned junturas que, according to forecasts, will have a brain drain every 100,000 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> State control of the pipeline was guaranteed by a robot submarino, pulled down by un ship, which carries out foreign inspections, as well as through a device that touring the home of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> In the form of pure, it introduces inside the tubo, which has a diameter of a metre, and moves with the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> On arrival, after three full days of travelling at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on posibles deformities of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline has been designed to function during 50 years without any kind of repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The movement of the gas is simply guarantees por pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The principle is 200 bars y at the exit of 100 bars. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The company leader is Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> To her, they joined the german E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the dutch Gasunie y the group French GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five sociedades have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploit the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Tiene su sede Zoug in Switzerland, where the imposition resulta particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Later, Gazprom hired in this society, over a period of 25 years renovable, the entire transport capabilities of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> « A Gazprom repay them por the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas realmente se transporte », precise Jens Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Financing the construction of the pipeline is carried out by 30%, with the input of shareholders and 70% with loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 million euros for two tubos. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Para GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached the 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> Pero minority shareholders are certain that must not exceed su investment, as Gazprom sí solo takes over the risk of spending. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, in a sandy coastline plantada pine. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> Unas válvulas, with 4.5 metres high, are the exit door of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are some sensores que measured the temperature and pressure, the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before transfiera pipelines to the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday, the terminal recibe un million cubic meters of russian gas every hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Totally at capacity, will be tres million per hour and in 2012, six million. </seg>
