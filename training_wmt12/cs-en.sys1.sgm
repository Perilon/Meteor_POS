<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years has problems with overweight, with excess weight is 9 percent of schoolchildren and obese is 5 percent of the children. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Obese children, most of them come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as demonstrated by the current survey. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Once again, shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which grows, and model, which is surrounded by. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables in obese children, for example, some of the sausage up to half of the more frequently than in the families of children with normal weight. </seg>
<seg id="82"> French fries for dinner the day before research associated with awareness - raising actions with the name of obesity is not an accident more than 19 percent of the obese. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families wieners also used to work out, which is, of course, the concerns of most families today &apos;s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children answered that their parents at least once a week to find time for an active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> A survey of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> A survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and attended him nearly 900 children of primary schools from around the country. </seg>
<seg id="86"> It was the second year of the actions of obesity is not an accident, which supports universal health insurance and Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> So far, the project involved more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 to 8. classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family is one of the decisive factors, which causes dramatically increasing the number of children who are overweight or obese. </seg>
<seg id="89"> `` Only half of the respondents, for example, said that her five times a day in the breakfast - lunch - lunch - lunch, dinner, which is one of the basic requirements of good nutrition, &apos;&apos;is one of the results of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Free breakfast and evening the sausage </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts suggest that, for the healthy development are essential and relative details, one of which is to be a regular time family breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic while at the same time having breakfast, only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren. </seg>
<seg id="93"> In most families eat breakfast each alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And the worst of it was that, in a tenth of households with breakfast at all. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the correct daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children are more often unhealthy eating french fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks each day sweet lemonade (70 percent). </seg>
<seg id="98"> On a regular basis, not a sport, more than 40 percent of respondents said the children, but for their parents, the result was less than half - 15 percent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Report your diet </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey to selected children (204 of boys and girls from 172 13 schools), of the options offered his own diet, according to their own tastes and his own opinion. </seg>
<seg id="101"> `` The dietary preferences of czech children aged 12 to 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet far from ideal. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among his favorite food is a lot of flour, meat and fresh food. </seg>
<seg id="103"> `` The alarming is particularly great popularity of soft drinks, &apos;&apos;says in the final report of the survey. </seg>
<seg id="104"> For lunch, as a main dish won pasta just above the poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> The children but they did not want pulses and low is the popularity of the fish and the vegetable dishes. </seg>
<seg id="106"> The trend toward health </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits, if they get the right information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> `` In the control group of participants in the survey, who filled out a questionnaire after the end of the educational lectures obesity is not a coincidence, it is, in many cases, a significant shift preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet, &apos;&apos;says in the results of the project. </seg>
<seg id="109"> It was noticeable, for example, in soft drinks, where he began to more children prefer plain water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> Children are also more often set in the questionnaire, poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and reduce the sweet food and dumplings. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Makeup artist must also be a good psychologist, says the pros </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the opening section on how to teach stylists, I am a little bit complained that it had in the early hours. </seg>
<seg id="113"> I had no idea what will happen next. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The lectures of three professionals in the field, wearing black characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set. </seg>
<seg id="115"> And it will get worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, is really `` crowded &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we are discussing with the director Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only kid), dressed as a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical shape. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And such is the overwhelming majority. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Someone has a short neck, someone &apos;s boyish figure without curves and some overweight. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Makeup artist must know how optically soften his broad shoulders, extended his neck or to supply the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We got so tips, both for women like Jennifer Lopez, the greater her breasts and hips and a narrow waist, figure pretty stressed and at the same time a woman dressed too challenging. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, is the difference between the waist and hips that skirts or trousers really fit, then it pays to have made at least one of these to peace. </seg>
<seg id="124"> Certainly you will not regret it, because the perfect - fitting clothing is priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In a skirt to peace will feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, shrugs, stood in the middle and the like. </seg>
<seg id="126"> The boyish figure, he can afford to wear clothes with folds, applications, embroidery or scooped. </seg>
<seg id="127"> Such information and the type of characters are, of course, many, so I am glad that I have a week to all of the information in the mind of the sort out. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And I fear that, due to the domestic task is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the kurzistek gets assigned to the celebrity, which has come up with two outfits: the day and evening. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We have to take into account the current design, fashion and style of the personality of the type of character. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I will be the `` dress &apos;&apos;Miranda Kerrovou, perhaps you know it from the campaigns of Victoria &apos;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the spirit of the jubilant, for me personally, certainly better than a Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please do not take into account the hyperbole), or very young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> We must avoid outfits from magazines or search on the Internet and print and graphically process. </seg>
<seg id="134"> Moodboard, the result, he says, then express my personal style and the relationship to design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> I think about the video site stylingu is important. </seg>
<seg id="136"> A stylist, dresses only physically, but also build, for example, the so - called product site in magazines (in particular the award, for example, trends, bags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> It told us a stylist and designer Mario stonemasonry. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But it until Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> Makeup artist must have a general overview </seg>
<seg id="140"> Saturday &apos;s lecture loaded with information on the types of characters at three guests from the field. </seg>
<seg id="141"> Makeup artist John Humble, fashion designer James Polanky and fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub remind us that fashion is an illusion and stylist should know how to use. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And a stylist knows how to work with a single piece of clothing in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The variability in this case is the key. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So a trenchcoat (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) you can wear a classically over jeans and t - shirt, but you can wear on his body, his shoes and photographed as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Or just roll up their sleeves and collars, and now the whole look is different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> `` Play with it, &apos;&apos;he stressed. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most of all I appreciate the following advice: `` you need to work a perfect knowledge of the rules. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="149"> `` Then you can start to break, &apos;&apos;said Jim. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, I am not clear why the smashing all those lessons, what with the combined, why, why, as well as in fashion magazines often we see something else. </seg>
<seg id="151"> On the show, not to mention. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben again, I know that the stylist must have produced a lot more options than clothes, how many of them are taking pictures. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So in a fashion story, which will have 10 pages (ten outfits), I have to be ready to `` nastajlovat &apos;&apos;at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that a picture of the dress looks and works in combination with other pieces of often quite different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With that, then we have got to in the formation of the outfits count. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and style is often half of success, we confirmed John Humble. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Just look at Madonna, who is not just a singer, but the image and marketing of the World Star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic &apos;s approach to the use of the services of a makeup artist rather cold. </seg>
<seg id="159"> The familiar faces, it often considered unnecessary (just something I can do, how to be subordinated). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if they get from us someone will create a styling, then we expect us to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than it really is. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then there &apos;s than googlovat and find out if the Boulevard of the celebrity ztoustla / weight and the like. </seg>
<seg id="162"> John and Mario on Sunday to a makeup artist is not enough to fashion and be able to put the outfits. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In their work, in particular, he interacts with people who dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> I can not judge people, pandering to stand up for his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> `` When you get a manager, to all out her wardrobe and with some nice things, so you can not throw out of the closet and say, oh, my God. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="166"> `` There are at least a few of the things he said and recommend what to wear, &apos;&apos;says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> We also specifically pointed out what it must include the so - called `` placovka &apos;&apos;, or the bag on the field. </seg>
<seg id="168"> It is that which you turn around and you have all the necessary accoutrements. </seg>
<seg id="169"> In addition to clear things, such as the cylinder on hair or safety pins, there are also silk thread (with her stylist helps out for photos of products, such as handbags and hats), special clips, to join in the back of the clothes, if it is more (a pin or another clip is not acceptable, that would suit), or a sewing kit. </seg>
<seg id="170"> To hear, but also a practical test, we learned how to properly relined shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even at a photo shoot in the studio, which is equal to the surface, I could damage, let alone out there. </seg>
<seg id="172"> And so we are stuck, stuck. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The pair of shoes, was not hurt. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So the real skill. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario please me, when my creation without reservations, he said. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The skill that really is not my friend. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is only a tiny fraction of what we do on the second weekend of course listened to. </seg>
<seg id="178"> I am getting more and more clear that, given the stylingu on a professional level really is not a walk in the park, to say what they want. </seg>
<seg id="179"> In Need for speed: the Run, racing across the whole of America. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally Easy Rider, because of a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes change in routine morning trip to shift. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Ambition is to a large extent met, but it &apos;s no good, when no one is reluctant to do anything more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> New part: the run up to the high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised that the age - old racing series of Need for speed again moves a new direction and a playable demos, appeared as a game, which would be in the genre of action racing might not be the only in number. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious about the passages in which the hero gets out of the car and will be on their own. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But, as in a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> They are potentially decent arcade racing, but the whole drags down several unnecessary errors, which is in a series of appear more or less for several years. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So it was not the error, but rather the manifestation of some incomprehensible lazy developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> In the story, in which the hero Jack has some problems of a personal nature and the solution is to be participating in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> Behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get the first in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The idea has some interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The route is divided into 10 stages, and then to more than fifty businesses. </seg>
<seg id="194"> The result of this is that every race is run on a route and the stage is set in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> So does not even have a sense that the game is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some of the environment, moreover, are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphics corresponds to the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So it &apos;s no big deal. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The race is, in addition, from time to time complicated by some kind of amusing element. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, few in the storm, which greatly reduces visibility. </seg>
<seg id="201"> By contrast, in the mountains, you have to pay attention to you in an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> Next to it are quite well for him at the individual races. </seg>
<seg id="203"> It &apos;s not just a few types, but it&apos; s enough. </seg>
<seg id="204"> He is now trying to pass the required number of rivals (in the classic race), then you are driving time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then waiting for you to be a duel with a single match. </seg>
<seg id="205"> It is even more from time to time he gets and the police, which all your efforts even more unpleasant. </seg>
<seg id="206"> News of the outside of the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Instead, it is only on such interactive animations, when Jack mostly run from someone and you must help so that, in the right moments of pressing the right buttons. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Nothing too complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Surprise but that these passages in the game a lot less than you might expect (specifically, perhaps even only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> As a result, but it &apos;s a good thing, because this element does not have the chance to become poisonous, and in the context of the question is one of the elements that game break. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The model comes in the wake of the previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> This means that in today &apos;s world is not everything, but we can not say that would be drawbacks. </seg>
<seg id="213"> If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But the action - based racing here the model is still quite well, although we in the competition to find a better. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Thus far, perfectly all right. </seg>
<seg id="216"> But the problems are starting to appear at a time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> Unlike the model of a very fine is not a model of conflict. </seg>
<seg id="218"> From the games of this type, we expect that the complex distortions and conflict, but when virtually no impact on any object, you do not have the faintest idea how your car it, then it &apos;s all right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Typically in a tight overtaking or passing cars in normal operation, sometimes only slightly each other at, but at other times in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild pirouettes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or even the right to smithereens. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the system - it does not matter, but annoyed you can reliably. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The system is designed so that if I or you go far beyond the track, he will throw you a game back on the last point of reference on the track. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But the system is in every race available only five. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If it is not, you have to race to start from the beginning again. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is therefore a such a device for the case, that something was wrong, but that it might actually be relied upon. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes, but not - they will not help solve it is up to the need to learn the section of the plant from memory. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The malady of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some of the curvy, for example, is the need to go through a specific way, otherwise they just come in. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Sometimes you will meet at the site of the `` civilian &apos;&apos;cars is always in the same configuration of whatever you get there first, fifth, five seconds sooner or later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> It sucks, especially in situations where you can see how between two oncoming cars opponent before you easily pass through, and when you get there, you are already cars in a position that is you have to drive around or slow down. </seg>
<seg id="231"> It is one thing to them, you get, because it is `` doomed &apos;&apos;so that the situation there was always just before your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Opponents also have another advantage. </seg>
<seg id="233"> For all the time playing in several places, where you, again, regardless of the time, always gets the same opponent in the same place. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Most of the hits in the game on a bridge, where you are going in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The opposition is there in front of you must have apparently not at any price. </seg>
<seg id="236"> When it &apos;s in front of you, so you have exacerbated by an oncoming cars, so at first, about a couple of nice. </seg>
<seg id="237"> You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting, adrenaline, but it is so obvious that you can reliably quickly. </seg>

<seg id="241"> You have to be careful at a gas station on the roads, because that &apos;s where you can change the car, although in most cases you can get away with what you have got. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>

<seg id="281"> As far as its motto `` clearly and openly about Europe &apos;&apos;takes seriously, she showed in the first part of the course, where she was able to describe the EU institutions and their relations so easy - and clearly she could be that many of the speakers from the Law Faculty of envy. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> `` At first appeared criticism that is flat, that is the official, that he can not play any role, and I have to say that all the breath out of that role very well for himself. &apos;&apos; </seg>

<seg id="286"> None of us wants to prohibit cheesed </seg>
<seg id="287"> Vicenová went on to the agenda, which the European Council was, is and will live in the near future. </seg>

<seg id="293"> In addition, has yet to approve a new seven - year budget of the Union, which is due to the current economic situation far more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether the budget will be a lean and efficient, that the industry will be given priority, that the country will be supported by more and more, all of that is on the agenda of the next meeting. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador said his main slogans, which came to Brussels: `` Europe manner &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> `` I really do not like the ugly symbol, foreign words, jargon, that no one understands. </seg>

<seg id="304"> `` Believe me, when it comes to me polish and hungarian and Slovak, so the Frenchman next to me said, `` Hey, what &apos;s out there, what&apos; s your Visegrad four? `` and never looked happy. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="305"> In the future, the Union under Vicenová are especially tough new rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> As a very real, the concept of a two speed, if not a multi - speed Europe, rather than the new `` European Federation. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="307"> `` We have the euro - zone countries and countries outside the eurozone. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="308"> `` We have the Schengen area, we have had and the Institute of enhanced cooperation. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="309"> `` For the first time it was told to cooperate only countries that want to, and those who do not want to be standing close. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="310"> `` The Institute will be more, and it will be a two - speed Europe, &apos;&apos;expects Vicenová. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect, also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle, according to which all of the issues that have an impact on the whole of the Union, the discussion between all the Member States, not only between the countries of the euro area. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand Story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> An innovator IBM begins the second century of his existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> Someone looking for words that convey the strategy of IBM, say `` long term &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public &apos;s IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is the name of the perceived as very current, and yet, since its founding more than a hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis of this long term laid the first head of the firm, a visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He coined the word that many of the world &apos;s problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think about. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His motto, `` Think! &apos;&apos;in the past, which will form the basis for the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine, which in IBM began to be based in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> It was also the basis for Watson carefully cultivated corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> `` For us from IBM &apos;s long - term thinking of continuous movement toward the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years due to remain true to its core values, and it is not all about change. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It allowed us to during our first centuries of transformative technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the second hundred that we can do even more, &apos;&apos;he said to the anniversary of the current chairman of the company &apos;s Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="324"> The elaborate system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson in the 1930 s to care for their employees as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic - the IBM was one of the first american workers paid vacation, insurance from their employer, plus an elegant staffing uniform and an elaborate system to reward the best inventors, and traders. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As advanced has long - term IBM and the relationship with the customer. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company has since the beginning of the genius in the extraction of talent - as one of the first global firms to abolish discrimination of any kind, so he could collect. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In accordance with the strategy of the anti - discrimination is the current plan that Palmisano, IBM in the lead in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> The IBM in the work of thirty years, still holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM in recent years doing so - called yams, on - line brainstorms, of which raises many future strategies and innovation. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is no wonder that the ideas is enough - the company he works for almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> The institution with a good name </seg>
<seg id="333"> The firm position in business gives us a strong internal and external image. </seg>
<seg id="334"> `` From the beginning, IBM, rather than just the concept of the institution of technology companies, &apos;&apos;said Economistu Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> `` IBM &apos;s technology company, but a firm that helps to solve business problems for the use of technology, &apos;&apos;said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company itself, he says, is the difference between the market and the market right to create. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - or `` big blue, &apos;&apos;as it is due to its logo in the United States familiarly nicknamed - in a hundred years have grown into one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is apparently versatile technology company, is developing the software and hardware infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from servers for nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Holding the most patents in U. S. technology companies and five of his employees received the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among her accomplishments include the need to withdraw cash, credit card, financial swap, bar code or disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year, has become the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, has been overtaken by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Look forward </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovation is a taste of customers and time - IBM, for example, made a bet on its own operating system, OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or computer IBM PCjr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> `` If your business is built on the move forward, you can be emotionally tied to the past, &apos;&apos;poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problem to build the foundations of the many platforms - and when do not work, so as to leave them. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to, say, the rival Microsoft, which in principle it stands or falls on the Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technology </seg>
<seg id="348"> The IBM is the largest share of services, after roughly a fifth of the software and hardware. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Yet in 1990, with more than half the strongest advocate hardware. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM has sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period has invested 58 billion dollars to purchase of promising technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In the investment continues from 2008, when, for the first time, the world over the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM is in accordance with the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the volume of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Still, it seems that IBM passes through the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The price of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 increased by rocket 120 percent, net income, the company continuously growing. </seg>

<seg id="481"> The development of the prices package since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> In 1989, it was in the former Czechoslovakia allowed only five state travel agencies: Michelin, Sporturist, COM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel office at the time of the sale in the overwhelming majority of only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited. </seg>
<seg id="484"> Czech tourists to travel on a vacation to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and in Hungary (Lake Balaton). </seg>
<seg id="485"> The notable exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when she was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime turned to the west and the czech tourists in Yugoslavia is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="486"> The great paradox of the socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i. e. Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely individually or in the context of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> In the event that the Citizen of Czechoslovakia individually to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed in this country a letter of invitation from, or the way possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The travel office at the time as offering package tours to the West, but it was the need to queue through the night sleeping bag or be in the `` good friends &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Even so, however, it was not out of the woods. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so - called international commitment, which was provided for the trip to the West, was awarded the `` politically unreliable people &apos;&apos;, which can travel at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The currency is not freely convertible currency, free of foreign - exchange commitment, so it was not possible to obtain funding (western currency) on the way to the west. </seg>
<seg id="492"> By far the most often, however, the Czechs were on vacation in the country, and the result was a large number of cabins and cottages, which the Czechs to procure and this custom survives to this day. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Czechs travel so experienced since 1989, the real revolution. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While in 1989, it was a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria our best last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> The paradox is that you are already aware of, it &apos;s that, for us, is currently the most popular of Croatia was not possible in 1989 to travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Now in the early 1990 &apos;s, following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring west european countries, which triggered a huge surge of short - term visits in Vienna, Austria or Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> Czechoslovakians, for a long time, can not get enough of the trips to the west, everybody wanted to at least for a second look. </seg>
<seg id="498"> For example, in Paris for tours of the Czechs in parks in tents, since the revenue to pay for a hotel or guesthouse. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of the travel of the Czechs were in this time of the haul of their own food cans, sausages, etc., to save. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important moment was the introduction of the convertible crown, which our tourists could finally after many years destítkách freely to buy western currency. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living, and with it the average salaries, however, rose, prompting around 1997 in another important moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel beginning to travel regularly from 1997 to prepare the tours of charter flights, which will air travel because of the possibility of contract volume discounts in comparison with the past incredibly cheap. </seg>
<seg id="503"> In the late 1990 s, had already czechs visa - free travel to virtually all of the world &apos;s advanced countries, in addition to the US, which continue to facilitate our travel. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of post - revolutionary travel was in 2000, when he was due to strong demand of the Czech Republic &apos;s first charter flight to exotic, it was in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> From this year, and each year the world with czech tourists direct flights to warm far countries, this year &apos;s winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Exotic country currently visit already around 100 thousand Czechs per year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> November 17, 2008, abolished the US visas for czech tourists and that our country has ranked among the most advanced countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in the history of the spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 000 per person. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The AGM is to find the President again but there is a stalemate </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months is the czech football without the president, and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Jaroslav Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held on Thursday in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral system will be followed. </seg>
<seg id="513"> Without it, they do not begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="514"> The result, the czech football have Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> Hašek resigned from office in June, and upon his retirement urged colleagues to unite and found a strong personality, which would have led to a football game in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> But in the era after Hašek football back to the clashes between the two republics houses, which can not agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> And it turned out 16 September, which was to be the new chairman of the selected. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates of the general meeting of the National House in Prague on Smíchově down unnecessarily, since the negotiations remained blocked, and not just the way the elections. </seg>
<seg id="519"> There was not a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - if only the statutory representatives, or even officials the power of attorney. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendations of the Institute for the state and the law, according to which the representation of the mandate is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> Disputes but still there is on the electoral system. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Too much clarity on the situation, nor the Executive Committee, which had at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, in essence, nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Look at the choice of several times had changed, but a neuralgic point is still the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how to proceed in the 3 rd round, in order to avoid the possibility of stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> `` The dispute is about whether to proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, or to find a different model, &apos;&apos;said one of the three vice - presidents FAČR Dusan Svoboda, who in the leadership of the association representing professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> Under the proposed model in the third round of the of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which he &apos;s running. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is reportedly willing to go to compromise in order to win the candidate who gets more total per cent of votes from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> And the czech party advocating a condition that the winner must in the census to get at least a two - thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id="529"> `` But it would then become the two previous rounds, it would completely contradicted a bicameral concept, &apos;&apos;he understands the objections of the parties&apos; freedom, according to which would be the best order do not bend and to vote in accordance with the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> With that, somewhat surprisingly, agrees Thomas Paclík, though, it is estimated that the statutes of the electoral procedure complies with all the candidates most Pelt. </seg>
<seg id="531"> `` I wish to have voted for a maximum of the statutes. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="532"> `` In order to make up some of the nonsense as of last week &apos;s meeting, &apos;&apos;said the owner of the Victoria, who stands for the first time and in their statements, is primarily against Pelt. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelt remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In Nymburk, according to him, the new chairman of the unknown, and believe that the candidates together will be in the future work constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> `` All the passions calmed any of today &apos;s procedure for the national team to the World Cup. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="536"> `` Football again will be happy to wave, will be a greater willingness to cooperate, &apos;&apos;says jablonecký deputy, who is from the three largest experience in the management of football as a professional, and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl is reticent. </seg>
<seg id="538"> `` I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very ambivalent. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="539"> `` It &apos;s not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to assigned to adapt to the legislation. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="540"> `` It may cause it to stop the general meeting again. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="541"> `` I hope, however, that the good sense, &apos;&apos;said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> The agreement of all parties have a lot of time left. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some of the negotiations, was supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the contest will be football the generals do not complete. </seg>
<seg id="544"> Executive jet, in which they had to move to Podgorica, among other things, the vice - presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, namely from Prague due to a technical malfunction in the morning and was looking for a replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee of the barážové retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Finally, it might be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, that can occur in the center. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to split the party inside the strongest sports associations in the country to the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> In the game, it &apos;s a lot: public subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the forthcoming AGM ČSTV, which will bring a new direction for english sport after the financial problems of the condition. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes to fight for the President, because there is a suitable candidate </seg>
<seg id="549"> If the boss of footballers attractions Thomas Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate, which meets all of his ideas for the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), it would not be in the fight for the top post. </seg>
<seg id="550"> `` If the quality of Adept existed, I am fighting for him, and I am not going into the elections. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="551"> `` But in the current situation, no one had failed to find, &apos;&apos;said Stein Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="552"> In a battle with Miroslav Pelt and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Pelt, alleged the champion of the elections, he tried to avoid in the road in front of the FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also points out that, in the case of his victory in the role of the president he lasted only until 2013, when it &apos;s time for the Annual General Meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In office would probably like to see an experienced and top executive, who is not associated with a football background. </seg>
<seg id="555"> `` With some of the people who came into account, I am talking. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="556"> `` For me, it was crazy, but some say that, at the moment, with the czech football do not want to identify. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="557"> `` I wanted to change, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Paclíkovi says he now most of all is Peltovo connection with the president of the CAS regional football association Romano Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclíka is unacceptable to Pelt stood in the position. </seg>
<seg id="560"> `` If he won, so the sealing the state and not be in football. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="561"> `` In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a businessman, be it football do even more, &apos;&apos;said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Faces that Peltovo name years ago came in tapping in an investigation of corruption, of which, however, Pelt went unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="563"> `` I do not know what the prestige of the football Peltovo victory would bring. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="564"> `` Also, how they looked in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA, &apos;&apos;said Paclík, but they are already taking his statement that he would `` sell Plzeňský club, if Pelt became president.&apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the event that the Paclík in Thursday &apos;s election triumph, but with Pelt imagine future cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="566"> As he and the other candidate Rajchl, which Paclík supported before the September meeting, which ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> `` He (Pelt), was the first I &apos;d go. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="568"> `` He has a great ability. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="569"> `` I could imagine him to be as head of the team. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="570"> `` But - schedule would drive the association could not. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="571"> `` I also do where I can not do that, &apos;&apos;says Paclík, which attracted a great deal of attention in September that he was behind the Commission of arbitration in the lead with Luďkem Macelou, which replaced the Dagmar Damková. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík claims that the leadership of the Association of chance. </seg>
<seg id="573"> Refers to the ability of private firms, since last summer &apos;s in charge also Pilsen, who with his promotion in May to celebrate the opening league triumph. </seg>
<seg id="574"> `` I have to force his way in the football environment changed something to contribute to its particular culture. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="575"> `` To limit the effects of certain interest groups, which should have a tendency to affect the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which is up to the situation, &apos;&apos;says Paclík, who kept his antipathy, for example, to the spartan boss Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of the priorities would also considered the cement relations FAČR with czech Olympic Committee, which it for political leaders lobbied for it to be in the sport received more money from the lottery and taxes. </seg>
<seg id="577"> `` It is one of the key things that should be the new President. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="578"> `` If there is a tax on gambling, as declared political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but frankly they need to say where the money will go, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> As a burden now Paclík did not take his connection with the Pilsner club, although he says that the President FAČR should be `` bipartisan &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelt is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague. </seg>
<seg id="581"> `` It &apos;s not ideal. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="582"> `` But I do not see no point in it, to be hypocritical transferring its shares in the `` Club and a year and a half to go back to, &apos;&apos;says Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelt promised new statutes FAČR, which would exclude the election stalemate </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that, if elected, to FAČR new statutes, which would in future definitively exclude disputes over the electoral system. </seg>

<seg id="586"> Pelt before September the choice has promised that the right to representation and the acquisition of the Treasury intends to use in the event of the election of focus. </seg>
<seg id="587"> In the last election before the General Assembly decided to go at the last minute, and then the two - month suspension could use to his ideas about the governance of football champion and introduced in a broader context. </seg>

<seg id="590"> I therefore believes that he has enough experience to the czech football to drive. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that the current problems with the election &apos;s euphoria, as it was at the time of the Government of Ivan Jaroslav Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> `` Unfortunately, in the June meeting were approved by the rules, which were not so perfect, it was thought. &apos;&apos; </seg>

<seg id="652"> When the Iris Meder in the past one and a half year on a voyage of discovery, in his luggage missing: her bathing suit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Lying on his back on the water, looking up at the height of the elaborate set the dome, swam across the marble putti (the figure of a naked boy, the child &apos;s (with wings)), which was on the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools. </seg>

<seg id="657"> The 46 - year old german woman is a real entuziastkou plovárenské culture. </seg>
<seg id="658"> The sport was not overdoing it, says Meder - only in the water, it &apos;s something else. </seg>
<seg id="659"> The anger is just that fans of swimming must content itself with the blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the runners for health can be inhaled the fragrance of spruce forests or listening to the chatter of birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> `` One day, I asked why, in fact, the group must always be so ugly, &apos;&apos;says in Vienna living Mrs Meder. </seg>

<seg id="705"> Ackermann is a self - help to its image. </seg>
<seg id="706"> The organisation Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time, its criticism of the financial sector: `` betting on rising food prices shows in particular drastically, as ruthlessly Bank today is bad for the common good. &apos;&apos; </seg>

<seg id="724"> The story of the architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: the austrian pavilion at the World Expo in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became the museum in Vienna, stood empty and ruin. </seg>
<seg id="725"> It is now open again as the exhibition of the house. </seg>
<seg id="726"> When the all - out for the modern postwar architecture, for obvious forms, a glass lobby, bold strokes and new construction materials, which are typical of belief in technological progress, then it is the austrian pavilion architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World &apos;s Fair 1958 concise and illustrious example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzerův Pavilion received at the Grand Prix d &apos;Architecture for his mild and vznosně operating structure of steel and glass. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The construction is still seen as a milestone of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> Famous architect, also for the next World Expo pavilion built of Austria. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary four - cylinder BMW - plus the palace as the key carried out by building in Munich, 1973 internationally famous. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His as a temporary exhibition building designed pavilion at the World &apos;s Fair in Schweizer Garten in Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), and in 1962, opened the Museum of the 20 th century - was named as the `` house of the 20 th century &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="732"> But the building was not appropriate for the museum, or geographic or technically - were missing from the walls for the suspension of art exhibits, no satisfactory climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Yet it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna of the new stand. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001, the building was empty and dilapidated more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion, is now the name `` 21 st century &apos;&apos;and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday evening there will open the Belvedere museum, which includes the Palace, the first exhibition - happy intention in every respect. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Setting up a new start Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new head of the austrian Galerie Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein - Arco, across an art historian with a prominent career, M. J. in youth skater, later at Sotheby &apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, pushed strongly for the reconstruction of the politicians and preservationists, with public funds and private sponsorship money and a recovery. </seg>
<seg id="739"> In addition to the contemporary art should not be subject to the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby the foundations, should there be a cafe and bookstore, and had to be built from the office building. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, low - budget. </seg>
<seg id="741"> The implementation was then Krischanitz ideally cast. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only that, sensitively restored and expanded the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna, and he won the competition, but because, in Schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him `` extremely important &apos;&apos;, `` almost every weekend&apos;&apos; at the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew of the project and also about the problems of the building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change of use of the lost for their generosity and lightness. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In the current reconstruction were far more problems: the building was `` the trap for energy, &apos;&apos;says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Profiles of window glass facades were exchanged, used glass fibre reinforced with insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Chladové bridges - steel beams were strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos completed ceilings rescued. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two underground floor space for new uses, recessed lighting channel between the building and the street - lighting, to the entrance leads the bridge - almost a new building, but still lift Schwanzerův pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original front door were maintained, the building is painted in the old anticorrosion reddish color tone. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the screen is even more exactly the same as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all of this by English Heritage Authority and a low budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> `` Often had to be found material, which is a good, cheap and also liked the Antiquities Authority &apos;&apos;, says Krischanitz and notes on the floor of the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, and the problems of the reconstruction was building a flexible and airy. </seg>
<seg id="753"> He said that it was difficult to the pavilion, `` who came here from Brussels, &apos;&apos;he said recently Krischanitz, a typical `` drop - in - the - City - history&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such architecture was said to be `` always in the wrong place &apos;&apos;and still wants to `` wake up the appropriate self - confidence&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, but it &apos;s not the 21 st century on, as happened to the happy coincidence: in a circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely new design `` urban neighborhood near the main train station&apos; s office and residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And yet there is a different circumstance: the 21 st century could receive support from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and how it is heard, it is with the city for the neighborhood to the post in the Schweizer Garten. </seg>

<seg id="848"> But the attacks have taken on the part of the Turks a clearer sense of reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Do not repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the turkish press was particularly criticised the failure of german politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to those in Mölln, who survived, to visit. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After arson attack in Solingen sent a telegram of condolence to the president, but at a festival in Cologne represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus KINKEL - KINKEL in his speech he calculated what charges the Turks were giving. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Quite so, as if the man was at the height of his taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current turkish news media shows, once again, how deep the distrust many german Turks in the polities. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to extensive clarification and a new assessment of the extreme right wing of terrorism in Germany this time it requires open words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> Scandalous Bank in Lake Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> Yet the Bank of Europe does not have a seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost went bankrupt, and since then glide from one crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it has a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> So the Axel Weber certainly think so. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his noisy departure from his leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July known that taking 2013 to almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - and lucrative career move. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber, the forward publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said the remarks towards future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> `` Die UBS had a turnover. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="863"> `` I look forward to working with Kaspar Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September, it was clear that everything will turn out differently. </seg>
<seg id="865"> One dealer from UBS in London went all the safety systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros wasted. </seg>
<seg id="866"> The board of directors of UBS, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, the respected banker, he had to leave. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The president of the board of UBS has since also stunned - and they all ask: where does Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> It became known that Mr Weber bank since February 2012 may advise. </seg>
<seg id="869"> The Presidency of the Council and the government takes over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday said. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber that will be hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> It is not a banker, a professor of economics, and the issuance of a banker, would have time to incorporate the needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Once he takes over responsibility for the bank &apos;s strategy, which was once again proved that deserves the title of `` the bank&apos; s biggest scandals in Europe &apos; </seg>
<seg id="873"> As UBS &apos;s, on the other hand, a great - until recently was the largest asset manager in the world - and sliding, on the other hand, had for years from one scandal to another. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, is proud of the swiss bank spared. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It began in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> In 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the silent, and a solid, but also a trustee combines with the ambitious objectives: I also mean something in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So managed by UBS 2007, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And, on the other hand, refer to it as the investment bank in the league of the world &apos;s largest banks </seg>
<seg id="880"> It made an impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and a longtime professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger says: `` my students at UBS, always as a model of good banks. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="882"> `` From today &apos;s perspective, people ask: how I could be so wrong? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something has gone wrong at UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year has resigned, surprisingly, the boss of the Board of directors Peter Wuffli, who has not been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, I do not know why he left. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The investment bank division has wasted subprime - Papíry and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To that end, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> But actually find investors, but such, recently had her: opaque asian state fund from Singapore and an arab state fund, which was so discreet that you do not know his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But it was only the first crash. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it was worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to admit new billions in losses, the President of the Management Board of Marcel Ospel, 2006 is still the second best - paid directors of Switzerland, has resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 there was a disaster: UBS was due to bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse, and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatorily convertible bonds, which could become a co - owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Throughout the whole of Switzerland was shaken - because, as it is dramatic for a small country, as he has on its territory, so the big banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all, the balance - sheet UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture). </seg>
<seg id="897"> `` Once again we could not save UBS &apos;&apos;, says banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="898"> The disaster is the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> In the last few months, it has surrendered UBS in a tax dispute with America and its willingness to the issue of data of wealthy clients who, as far as possible, with the help of the banks passed the tax. </seg>
<seg id="900"> In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as the return of the profits from these transactions, including the parking charges. </seg>
<seg id="901"> It has been subjected to UBS more or less openly that helped by cutting taxes. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time, lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for the rich clients: a halo of discretion. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After this scandal has already been the swiss bank secrecy that, as before. </seg>
<seg id="904"> There followed the resignation of Chairman and President of the Management Board. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And an exodus of customers&apos; money. </seg>
<seg id="906"> So the bank lost in the course of a few months, his credibility in the central business areas: in the investment banking because of poor speculation and property management for helping to reduce taxes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when it was again a little comfort, just as it was thought that UBS is once again, here comes this unfortunate commercial quest: one dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank saw that something is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking it probably still is not working. </seg>
<seg id="909"> `` A case that Adoboli had revealed that the control of risk has changed too little, &apos;&apos;says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Finanz bank of the Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also, the financial director of the big german banks is certain: `` the problem of UBS is that they can not control the risks. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="911"> It was not exactly the idea of caution with which the swiss bankers started a long time ago, to become the capital of the world: not too much of a risk, but the safety for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic collapsed again the world. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The swiss banks have become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high - quality chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of UBS in Zurich is more suited to a good swiss private bank - it &apos;s just a little bit more. </seg>
<seg id="914"> Now the position is a classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the lake, which is backed by the swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are beautiful, lettings business is one of the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewelers like Tiffany &apos;s was found between the swiss traditional business as an ice cream parlor Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Already, over the centuries, it is the swiss banks: from the Nationalbank over Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the lobby, UBS will enter the heavy the revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside the walls are lined in marble, a large leather chairs, in addition to the logos of the bank &apos;s big direction for `` safe &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the Swiss Bank both swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - suppressed or betrayed, as is the boss of one small swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name would prefer not to read in the papers, he concluded, as all of the swiss bankers, also with both velkobankami shops. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS is probably too grown, notes - particularly in investment banking, where he also expanded the Anglo - Saxon. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss, they do not have anything to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> `` And if not, they adapted to long Anglo - Saxon ways. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed, it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, which UBS has changed, gave her first high profits and then disaster: no european financial institution had not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> October 15, 2008 was a disaster. </seg>
<seg id="929"> `` In the center of a government coalition of small sedmimilionové country on the rescue operation in the history of the nation &apos;&apos;, says the author Lukas Hässig in his book `` Der UBS - Crash&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> To 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euro accepted by politicians to rescue from bankruptcy standing velkobanku. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> If the talks with the swiss bankers, so you can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three swiss velkobank within the group. </seg>
<seg id="934"> The bank, which is already on the merger was too big for a small Switzerland - and still continue to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that the two different bank predecessor UBS complement: a rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich in the management of the property and the poorer, but internationally strongly involved. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Then came an internationalized investment bankers for many of the money with which to spin the roulette wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> With the rise of UBS are linked by two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group, UBS and Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> `` I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel &apos;s team of the future, &apos;&apos;says banking expert Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> `` Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about the models and statistics and Ospel, managing the feelings around the stomach, who is from the bank of science has completely up. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel, he says, to the end of the counting on Wuffliho. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli was at the end of the likely to have done a crucial error: `` I think he thought that his models are a reality, &apos;&apos;says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> `` This is a tragic case. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="943"> The tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: pride. </seg>
<seg id="945"> UBS employees are clearly remember the meetings managers, on which the group chief Wuffli repeated again and again the same password: knock Goldman Sachs from the throne. </seg>
<seg id="946"> Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> `` The League Tables &apos;&apos;, the waiting list, which documents the success of the banks of the time. </seg>
<seg id="948"> In trying to UBS on the location of the very top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> A few steps away, she has succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In a trade with the foreign exchange and stock participated in the games at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Corporate advisers who were responsible, but underline one weakness: interest in international trade, in the language of the bankers&apos; `` Fixed Income &apos;&apos;, I think there is a big gap for the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has some gaps in the U. S. mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To this gap has been closed, the UBS to adventure, which it almost cost the existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, investment as the bank itself and her based fund to ensure the risks to the U. S. subprime investments. </seg>
<seg id="955"> Developed in the engine, securities diaper on America &apos;s mortgage loans and to - yet, but also by leaving the risk. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Still, when other banks have long sought a way out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> `` Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS buying, &apos;&apos;says banking expert Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="958"> How big is the euphoria, so deep in the fall. </seg>
<seg id="959"> One manager, had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than was thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> The position at UBS became an ejection seat and into today &apos;s sway. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who leads velkobanku now has almost unmanageable work. </seg>
<seg id="962"> They must find a strategy for the bank, which all the close of business models. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Banking expert Geiger has had an idea: the end of the investment banking, the concentration of wealth management, a return to the roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Not so far, the Bank did not (yet) does not want to go. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But the investment banking industry has severely cut, so much is now clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The next Thursday to the new head of the Bank &apos;s Sergio Ermotti imagine the world their future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 - year - old swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, as the bank surprisingly broke up with her predecessor Grübelem. </seg>
<seg id="968"> In the meantime, he: for long - term business, UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants the investment bank noted back to the state in the mid - 1990 s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> 3500 posts. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But it will not be enough. </seg>

<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What he wants to make money? </seg>

<seg id="1305"> The best books of the First World War, mostly rather than with a complex story worked with hints of, for example, `` the First World War and the modern memories &apos;&apos;from Paul Fussella or novels like `` all Quiet on the Western Front&apos;&apos; from Erich Maria Remarquea. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Mr Englund prefers the conventional. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book has the most overwhelming conclusion, which in popular literature is unprecedented. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I told him. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> You will, however, seems to be, it was as if the author of books, you page of a list of heroes from his hand and lit it. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After the previous mistake this time to the minute planned raid </seg>
<seg id="1311"> In hundreds of police officers, some in their helmets used in the street riots. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it would have been almost empty Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The action did not one but several high - ranking officers. other was first told that this was a training exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> At the forefront of the action, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence underscored how many problems to the police department in the operation. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> May not be repeated cases of recent weeks, which, for example, to the use of pepper spray against the demonstrators, in violation of the rules of the department, and a wave of public sympathy flowed to the squatters. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> Therefore, the police operation, which was to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park, opened up after two weeks of meticulous planning and exercises. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The leaders are inspired by operations undertaken in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A massive exercise in case of conduct in crisis situations in parts of the Randalls Island, which was preparing to try in Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The leaders of the so - called training for riot - counter - terrorism measures including a rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the part of the City of Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> Orders to move into the park were literally `` at the last minute, &apos;&apos;said someone who was action originally explained only as `` exercise&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> `` I know a couple of police officers, who were in this action also called upon, and certainly no one said, that &apos;s going to Zuccotti Park, &apos;&apos;said the person, who spoke only on the condition that he remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> `` That &apos;s going to Zuccotti Park, a senior member of the department. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One of the grounds of secrecy was a lesson that has the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> 14 October were the city &apos;s leaders in the park clean, but then backed away from the plan, because as soon as he heard about him protesters swarmed them before the start of the operation to park hundreds. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> On Tuesday &apos;s actions involved officers from the various units, including response teams from all around - dozens of police officers, who are normally used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of delinquency. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that during the day in the park comes and goes, a large number of people, so one o &apos;clock in the morning was an ideal time, when the action started. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> `` It was appropriate to do it at the time, which will be in the park as few people as possible, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Before the troops heading, lined on the streets of Pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks with arc and loudspeakers. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lights and recorded a message from the speakers, many of the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> When they entered the park to the members of the police units in their blue windbreakers, many of the demonstrators packed up his things and left. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> Police say that until 1: 45 in the morning with the touch of a single tent, the protesters time to gather their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park to get, if it were needed to make an arrest. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> The reporters were forced to leave the park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said that it was for their safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> Many journalists, however, takes the view that the police want them to prevent their units in action, and in addition to some of the police rude. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr Brown said that the tv trucks on Church Street along the western border of the park without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The police moved west and a thick tangle of personal items of protesters, including luggage and plastic bags filled with clothes for her teams from the health department, which immediately get everything in the park &apos;s left. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some of the demonstrators, who refused to move, they were out of the park. describing the images appeared moments later on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> A group of protesters took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which was near the center of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some have created a roadblock and police launched their methodological arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Ten people in the center of camp to each other. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people are tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Until 3: 30 in the morning in the park, there have been no arrests, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the sound of the police. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr Brown said that in the park were detained by the approximately 142 persons. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Most of the arrests took place on the grounds of `` the riots and resisting arrest, &apos;&apos;he explained. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The senior police officer at the scene of the action was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the Police Department, the highest - ranking uniformed officer in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> The operation was personally involved in also Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives in the department. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Mr. Kelly was present, but `` in the management of the operation, &apos;&apos;said Mr Brown. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The second group of police officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was needed, that we need to call on. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the street Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the street Pine Street, a block south of the park, have been erected roadblocks. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Of these places, the police moved the further from Zuccotti Park. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> At one point they were police officers, many of whom have been equipped with shields, as crowds out people even further behind this limit. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> On the northern border was about 28 people. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the wildest events of the night were just south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> About five o &apos;clock in the morning was spotted one of the south of the Pine Street, jumped on the hood of the car, and a few others, who let the air out of the tires of a police van. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> At one point in the crowd out a piece of plywood. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the end of the operation was in hospital, one police officer and one of the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The trade union support staff will sue the city for release </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Unions representing hundreds of school support staff, who last month lost a job, in the center of the plan to sue the city. argues that the release was not necessary and it was a matter of discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, attended by the poor students. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The litigation is likely to be the last resort, which the unions in the field of District Council 37, left, in their efforts to reverse the decision to release. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> The 7 th October lost work six hundred and seventy two school aides, parent coordinators and other members of staff, who were among the worst - paid employees of the city of their release, the head of the union members described as revenge of the city for him last spring, access to health care fund managed by the work crews, by which the city wanted to patch a hole in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The city &apos;s leaders this charge flatly refused. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a meeting of the City Council, which was held last month, said the education minister Dennis M. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> One of the members of the Council immediately countered that, in the budget is not specifically mentioned on the release of the support staff. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Leaders of the city of District Council 37, announced that they have already made the necessary documents and warned of the Ministry of Education, that it will sue. in the middle of a press conference, where formally notified of the action in a state court in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The two defendants in the trial, Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the claimant &apos;s eight laid - off workers, all of whom are afroameričany or hispanic males, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city, said that the city still claim, and therefore to the indictment will express. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to the complaint, which was obtained by the New York Times, the unions have focused on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, which wants to support its claims about the injustices of the negotiations. he had the view that the poor school more assistants, because they are already denied sufficient financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Island, the layoffs at all, and in parts of the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in a part of the District 23 in Brownsville came on the work of the 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was released even 46 assistants. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Recalls that in school, Public School 36 in Harlem lost the work of five of the eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of students live in poverty in the lawsuit says: `` it &apos;s not a neighborhood full of parents who can provide funds to cover the deficit in the budget. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The budget of the School of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent and the school also lost money, when the city changed the way of calculating the bonus of finance for the poor student. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also claims that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way it was written document authorising the release of parent coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> In the document was to describe the actions of the use of the word `` excess &apos;&apos;, i. e., to abolish the position, although this word is more often used to describe the removal of teachers on the payroll of the school to a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> `` Sixty - six of parent coordinators have been released, &apos;&apos;says in the complaint, `` and not only moved into the database for the position of the workers.&apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1378"> The mission is over, the Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress to agree on something that concerns the uprising in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Before that, however, must have the revolution to succeed, for a long time, the reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the units of the United States closed. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Tuesday, the Commission for the international relations of the Senate to decide on the statement, which supports President John Kerry (Mass.) with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which should congratulate the Libyans to their successful revolt and U. S. forces to thank for the `` bravery &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> `` This declaration to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya, who began with the conversion of their country, &apos;&apos;said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> `` Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The sentence may seem innocuous, but no debate on Libya, and has not been easy. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> During the summer, lawmakers from both parties that even with the White House on the wording of a statement for approval or rejection of the military, the role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain resolution authorizing the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The proposal was rejected in the House because of different views of both political parties, so that the Senate would never vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> However, the same day, when he was in the House rejected the proposal, the House rejected the measure, which would stop the funding of U. S. operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> The U. S. mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress has criticised the way in which President Obama mission control, but its members apparently unafraid of so much to him in his actions stopped support. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The hesitancy of Congress finally passed another event. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The rebels took Tripoli in August and October 20, was killed by Qaddafi. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The mission later officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> It is now the Senate might be ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Commission for international relations, in its statement `` congratulates the residents of Libya for their tremendous courage and admirable tenacity, which invested in an effort to free his people &apos;&apos;and `` commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its allies, who were involved in the operation to protect the libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism.&apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The declaration also `` confirms the national interest of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1396"> The new proposal for the full support of the Commission for international relations, or legislators will be divided into two halves, as it was in the approval of the June draft? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version of the set of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief prosecutor of the Republican Party in the Commission. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugarův spokesman on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal as yet. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> In the House, will this week to vote on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> This measure, led by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), will be the First Amendment to the Constitution of the budget or any other issue, which will vote for the House or the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers, despite the considerable efforts have not yet managed to push through its proposals to the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattův proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were introduced in Congress and a wide variety of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and Senate - and others are only slight variations of the other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendment and a handful of others who would like to `` regulate federal spending &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the proposals are not the same, but their supporters - particularly from Republicans, who want to improve the reputation - can boast of their `` author &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require the addition of a balanced budget vote, the House and the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non - binding statement in support of such an amendment. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> In addition to the budget he wants a few members of the discussion of the limitations of the period in which the members of Congress to serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N. Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments, which would, among other things, to ensure the right to a good education and medical care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> A proposal remains an amendment to ban marriage to same - sex couples and the amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws in the case that, two - thirds of the states. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Although it appears that members of Congress in the design of the various amendments very active, compared with previous years, however, have not significantly exceeding the average. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111. Congress offered 77 amendments, while in the 100 th Congress was 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> Their activity even pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990 s, when, according to the statistics of Senate library members offered every two years, more than 150 amendments. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> They were not, however, much more successful than the current politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last amendment, which was added - 27 supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> `` Beat up, but not defeated, &apos;&apos;Gifford said in his first television interview since the shooting </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after her from the immediate vicinity of the injured his shot at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Ariz.) on Monday evening, appeared on national television, she sang together with music from the Broadway show `` the Sun Will Come out Tomorrow &apos;&apos;and said that more than a return to Congress wanted to be cured. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> Giffords appeared on `` 20 / 20 &apos;&apos;at the station ABC News with Diane Sawyer. showed that the sentences she still has trouble, and he needed help. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the injuries caused by a bullet that her in front of his skull, through the left side of the brain, and at the back of her left. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, surprisingly, she returned to the House of Commons, to triumphantly took part in the vote on the debt ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In his first television interview since the January shooting in which six people were killed and 13 others were wounded, Giffords smiling, laughing and singing - and his recovery, described as `` difficult &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked how she felt, Giffords forty - one - year - old said: `` quite well. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Giffordsovou and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one - hour special, the `` 20 / 20 &apos;&apos;, which was broadcast on the eve of the release of a new book, the couple called `` Gabby: a story of hope and courage&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> Special watched the entire convalescence Gifford from firing on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In the video, filmed Kelly during the first week, is to see Giffords in the hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> While her husband is encouraging, not at that time, more than just one or two fingers. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> A few months later, Giffords, sitting in a wheelchair and therapists taught her how to perform simple activities. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> Vyšpulení lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, her first word: `` what. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> In a few days, Giffords said another word - `` toast &apos;&apos;, as he demanded changes in their breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Video - ABC show that the central role for recovery Giffordsové music: Congresswoman on them singing along to a therapist to the tune of the song `` Girls Just Wan na have fun &apos;&apos;from Cyndi Lauper and `` Free Fallin &apos;&apos;&apos; from Tom Petty. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> During the interview, Gifford, which gives two hours daily therapy, Sawyer said that from the day of the shooting, he can not remember anything. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that Gifford read newspaper articles about the shooting until 12 March, when he first asked who she was six, who was killed in the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The shooting is the suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missoury, where under the influence of forcibly administered drugs awaiting trial. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> `` Too many people have died, &apos;&apos;said Giffords Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> `` Terrible, terrible, terrible. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1439"> Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife during her recovery, she said: `` I lost. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> `` So I just said, Gabby, you lose, &apos;&apos;said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> `` You have just got beat. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> But you can get together and come back even stronger than ever before. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Military units are confronted with compassion rather than with respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was the gala on Wall Street, which made millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who do not have a roof over his head. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration and a loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Gathered around him hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> They dressed the crowd stood and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> `` The men and women serving in the military were regarded as heroes, &apos;&apos;said David Saltzman, who spring benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> The first night was then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, it was in place, and Admiral Mike Mullen, however, saw the role of military units somewhat differently. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> `` All of them were introduced as some orphans, &apos;&apos;the officer wrote in an e - mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organizers meant well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that, yes. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But what I saw was not respect. it was a pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> So completely the opposite impression only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the american public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The army &apos;s bezbřeze included praise for his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But this praise, saying soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly behaves as if people in uniform. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> `` We are not victims, &apos;&apos;said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> `` But it seems that the only way we can do some support, is to put us in the role of the unfortunate souls. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> This issue is very sensitive for the military commanders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or a public relations, which we need. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They also recognise that anger, with troops returning once from Vietnam, was much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> The result is that most of the words of regret is spoken quietly and privately among veterans of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> When the two sons of the retired Colonel Mark Canciana returning from combat, where they served as a member of the Marine Corps, warned of their father, the service will be people outside the military look from two angles. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> From the point of view of some will feel respect and awe, because they defeated enemy insurgents and visited the exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Another but will be wondering if the `` beneath the surface of the ill, a veteran, &apos;&apos;said Cancian, who was part of the fighting in Iraq and the return of the took place in Washington in the government. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> He claimed that when looking for work, so some people who do the interviews, he suggested that so soon after returning to the fight can withstand the stress, which is associated with the work in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> `` When you talk about their service, you must expect a negative reaction, &apos;&apos;said the Cancian their sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Concern about the army partly stems from the american indifference to the wars. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Success on the field of battle rarely win recognition in the country, which is to own a small army of awareness and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is located just a few of his own benefit. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> `` As a nation already for the Army &apos;s heroics, as was the case during the Second World War, &apos;&apos;said Lieutenant General David Barna, who commanded U. S. forces in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the recognition by the politicians and the public focused mainly on the suffering of men under arms. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> The soldiers are excelling in the number of actions, which endured, the many friends who have lost, or the extent of his injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The Army is facing growing pressure to crack down on the use of rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week to decide whether will begin the process of 28 men and women against the army because of an alleged failure in the case of rape. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If not, they are prepared to bring the action of the hundreds of other applicants. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was in the night, when she was allegedly raped by her colleague from the Army, 25 years and was in the 11 th week of pregnancy. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks on Air Station Miramar, north of San Diego. after dinner with a friend on their male colleagues, carrying a box of 12 beers. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Asked if he could join them, that would be in her room for a drink. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> `` In my head, a warning light, &apos;&apos;she described Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But a native Texan her objections were ignored. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: no, he &apos;s 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> `` He &apos;s from Texas, &apos;&apos;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> `` I wish I listened to my instincts. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> Claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked, threw her on the bed and raped her. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military to wait for the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. it will be happening in Arlington, Virginia, and it is about whether the allegations against a former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, he will have to appear in court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld had failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The accusation was in February, a Washington lawyer, Susan Burke and the plaintiff had 17 members. over the coming months, however, the number has grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all say they have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by his colleagues in the army, and the army after the announcement of the weft of failed in the investigation, the punishment of any pursuit of justice. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says that going after a senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts right for them. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> `` The army is obligatory system, &apos;&apos;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> `` Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the introduction of measures against such action? the chain of command. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also alleges that from February contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could become part of a further action in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Her strategy: rather than to group all the charges in this case - put all its eggs in one basket, as she said - to bring in a number of different cases, if need be, to pressure eased. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> A team of defending the Defense Ministry leads the Attorney General of the United States Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues gave rise to the dismissal of the case. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> Court documents obtained by Newsweek, discuss the strategy of the defence - in essence, that current or former soldiers, the army can not sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> According to the regulation of the Supreme Court of the 1950 s called as the Feres Doctrine is not the federal government responsible for the injuries sustained by soldiers on active duty. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> `` The alleged injuries related to the military service of the plaintiffs, &apos;&apos;the document says. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Ministry of Defence is on this matter has refused to comment. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> However, things have changed since the 1950 s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Although women still officially may not serve in the fight, it &apos;s just a quibble: in modern wars, hard to find the right of the front line. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women in a war zone. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between the wars fell 150 soldiers of the female sex - two - thirds of them directly in the fight. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time to the modernisation and the military, explains Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> In their struggle is not alone in addition to her are dealing with the case of three other legal representatives. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> In law school Yale drawn visitors - a seminar on legal action on four main military academy for the development of the atmosphere of promoting hatred for women. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Regardless of the non - profit organization of America Vietnam veterans gathering evidence for its claim headed against the army. this action is in line with the diagnosis of a `` personality disorder &apos;&apos;, which was allegedly found in the victim of rape, in order to have the military an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as anal Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women &apos;s Action Network, a perfectly normal practice. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> The group already in December brought an action against the organisation for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for assistance from people who said they were in the service of a sexually attacked. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> In Congress launched nine separate proposals, a group of senators and members of both political parties and suggested in a number of corrective measures. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence of the Ministry of Defence was in the year 2010 reported 3,158 sexual assaults. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> This type of attacks remains, however, in most cases, unannounced and, according to its own estimates of the Pentagon this number represents approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents in a given year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> In a report issued in March is dismantled and the intensity of the prosecution of the suspects: in 2010 to get 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half as opposed to the civilian criminal justice system. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Burke described the attacks as the first of a series of trauma. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Private First Class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was made. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> During the night, he says, was asked for details about his rape said 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Have all the necessary tests to determine the rape and in her bed was found in the blood of the attacker - from the wound, which made him on the arm. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, has completed Lymanová hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions on whether that on the day of the attack she loved with his friend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The six people, as witnesses to the reputation to account for the benefit of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> `` I remember the day when he was a judgment, &apos;&apos;says Lymanová. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> `` I had the feeling that, right there on the spot to - screaming, I ran out of the courtroom. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> `` Put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I am his commanding officer said: it was not his court. my. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman told to attend a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed personality disorder, which she described as unfit for duty. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 was from the army without honor, and therefore not entitled to earn released. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whatever the case, the Lymans and others sought to move on to the next phase or not, it &apos;s a marathon, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> But, notes, `` from my point of view, they should be able to go to the next phase of the trial. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Between them and the verdict, however, is the doctrine, which was criticized by from the moment she saw the light of day. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The army is a few decades behind, because of their obligations to comply with the same degree of motivational incentives and deterrent. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Adds: `` the odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try it. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The change occurs only when good people willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> In the hearing decided in their favour, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Burkevoá, collected hundreds of other people prepared to take action and to work on other causes of this topic. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> `` We will not stop with the army in the fight, which is reformed, &apos;&apos;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whichever came first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> The walls have eyes: how will the scientists examined on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right - wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man, who his anti - immigrant views presented on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday the Braivik, who confessed to the killing rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Despite Breivik could act alone, in cyberspace, certainly was not alone: during the attack, he spent a lot of time in front of the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists in support of the right - wing groups on the social network. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how to find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Easily - just go on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> `` We realized we get is, is not that hard, &apos;&apos;says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report of the british research team, which involved the European Digital populism. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site, and with absolute precision to determine the demographic group - something that marketers are doing it for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlett &apos;s team across Europe found half a million fans of the right - wing groups, and then to focus attention and sent them ads. however, instead of their through to the newly established group or a kind of diet products, urged them to fill out a questionnaire in which there were questions about their level of education, the violence and optimism due to their own future. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 supporters of 14 different right - wing groups in 11 european countries - without it, so he had to leave office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> `` It &apos;s a whole new way of conducting research, &apos;&apos;notes Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results are not all that surprising: online followers of right - wing groups are mostly young men, which became an increasing level of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But on the other hand, `` those who its online activism combined with off - line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The team &apos;s work DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes the new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Research teams, medical scientists and researchers use the site to study everything from health problems and the social trends hiding under a status update, contributions to the walls and down `` like me &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The Facebook report more than 800 million active users. - each of them a day on average, with three different data, from the social network &apos;s literally `` information supernova &apos;&apos;, which is behind the development of many of the new research. number of academic work, in whose name is the word on Facebook, increased compared to the state five years ago to nearly 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some scientists is the magic of Facebook, in that it gives them a chance to study people without having to bother somewhere on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> `` Before, if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> `` You have to get to the parties, where would you but never allowed &apos;&apos;says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> `` All this Facebook degrades - you just go directly to them. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio - health problem and avoid them. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students, most of his drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more at risk of the problem of alcohol abuse than students who, on this subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno, proposed to fellow students websites monitored and come up with the offer of help student who is too much of a status. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> `` The problem can not be resolved, if it can not diagnose, &apos;&apos;said the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, a co - author Dr. Moreno, director of the Center for Health, behaviour and development of children at the Children &apos;s Research Institute in Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> `` We have found a way to identify at - risk children who would otherwise not have had a chance to occur. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook itself constantly probed the data of its users. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The information the team drew up the statistics on the context of relational statuses and on St. Valentine &apos;s Day, turnout in 2010 and the satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information to which they had access - advocates of Internet freedom have long claimed that the site had a treasure trove of information available for research and others). </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But users of Facebook, they know that the page is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend of mine, which is thousands of miles away, is the need to provide the site of your personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook will become part of the research, which do not even know? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off - line, on - line data, however, are available to everyone. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> `` To me, the most users do not even think that scientists can peer into their profiles, &apos;&apos;says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, carried out by using public Facebook wall of its students. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> `` As for them, so that the information is only between them and their friends. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Consequently, it is also considered the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> I research in the off - line, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Facebook &apos;s can not verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions to the truth. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> `` What you are saying on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, they are two completely separate things, &apos;&apos;explains Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> That &apos;s why Selwin, who spent long years of research into new technologies, thinks that a pencil and notebook, and continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in the research. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> `` When you go into the real world and talk to real people, this is something that can not be replaced, &apos;&apos;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> `` Social research should be on society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off - line. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> `` Cold and inhuman &apos;&apos;: Anders Behring Breivik participating in his first public court hearing </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people, in his first public court hearing in Oslo himself described as a `` resistance &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> `` I am the military commander in the norwegian resistance movement, and between the norwegian the Knights, &apos;&apos;he said before the court, where they gathered 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> `` I object to the Court of Justice, because you mandate granted the organization promoting the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> `` I confess their acts, but for them not to blame. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> The judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika during this monologue said, because `` he did not want to give Breivikovi opportunity to this hearing, used as a platform from which to voice their opinions. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, said Breivikovi, which brought with him a prepared speech, at the end of the hearing to reach out to the relatives of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered the police to Breivika held in custody for 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media for 4 nadsat and announced that the competent authorities will be for a period of eight weeks to complete control over all his visits and all correspondence. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some came in the hope that they will be able to Breivikovi looked into the eyes of others, therefore, to be sure, that &apos;s held firmly under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> They all took part in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> `` It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman, &apos;&apos;said the observer NRK, one of the survivors of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> `` It was not nice, but for myself, I can say that, after what I saw and heard the suspect, I was mentally pushed back a little further. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained throughout the hearing, calm and professional. on arrival and departure into the building without incident gaze of the journalists and the survivors in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breivik &apos;s bizarre notion that is part of a larger movement `` resistance &apos;&apos;, the judge decided that it is not crazy, and said that there is no evidence that he had an accomplice. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> For some, it may be some consolation that the attacks on 22 June, appear to be the work of a single extremists and not a group of militants. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> It does not diminish the grief and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> `` I wish to get out as a monster, but it is not, &apos;&apos;said a relative of one of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> `` If so, it would be a lot easier. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 the lessons of the lost interview with Steve Jobs in the movie in cinemas this week </seg>
<seg id="1592"> When Steve Jobs 5 October died, began to appear the views of the people who have compared with Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius, the largest modern inventor. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> The recently rediscovered Jobsově interview, which was convenience for the film, which was released this week, it will be for all fans of Apple &apos;s, the fact that his creative mind completely understand the business processes and work flows behind its products. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was a wonderful designer, idealistic and self - appointed member of the hippie, but at the same time also pedantic organizer and man that every little thing goes into great detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from `` the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between good and excellent the end product is still a long way to go and work. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, he worked Bob Cringely on tv the triumph of the computer, which dealt with the dawn of personal computing. during the filming took place in a unique, more than an hour - long conversation. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> This time it is ten years since he was forced to leave the company Jobs of Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, and looking as broad public acceptance of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> In the tv show was eventually used only a part of the entire Cringelyho conversation and about the original copies of the interview was said that was lost in transit. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Shortly after Jobsově death, however, were found in the VHS copies of the director &apos;s garage. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> It is this material, slightly clipped, forms the basis of the 68 minutes picture Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, who is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who was known for his distaste for the provision of a long conversation, Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic, that may be talking about his philosophy of technological and commercial strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And it also shows a very thoughtful man. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Four times in the course of the conversation, between a question and answer a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, which is seen as Jobs answer perfectly still, that was a short and precise. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when, on the surface of the sails Jobsův perfectionism, when Cringelyho issues are impatient and encouraged him to get to the problems and issues. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> The interview was filmed before the days of Pixaru, iPod or &apos;and appear in it eerily prophetic thoughts, when Jobs assesses, what does the rest of the company&apos; s good and bad, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to study a posthumous evaluation Jobsovy career, but on Jobs, seen here as an earnest dreamer in the prime of his genius, is something raw and inspirational. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> I have my own vision of how the case could and should look like. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> It did not take long, and after his thoughts, he is also began to put into practice. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick summary of the seven scenes of the interview, which is worth noting: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> How he learned to drive the company: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> `` Over the years, I have always asked: `` why are you doing this? &apos;and the answer was always the same: well, that&apos; s the way it is. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he &apos;s doing what he&apos; s doing, never on matters relating to the business does not think in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I found that out. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs says that describes his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> He was confused by the way they were recorded costs - often began reading `` standard costs &apos;&apos;, on their levels could only speculate. at that moment, decided to go their own way - developed an instrument that would guarantee that they could trade costs to determine within seconds. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> How did the mischief on the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs remembers the `` blue box &apos;&apos;, which was built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allows people to hack into the phone company and free phone anywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> The device that was written in the past have gone, but Jobsovo enthusiasm, when the blue box describes as an instrument of power, is literally contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> It tells how with Wozniak device tested using a pay phone and during the conversation, he left the transfer from one network AT &amp;amp; T to another, while with the largest number of satellites. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> `` At least half a dozen times we are like that - around the world, so when we then something called the pay phone, there was not a minute later on the phone at the door, &apos;&apos;laughs Jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> `` We were young and we found ourselves, we can build a case, which is capable of running the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> The two of them have made a little thing that could control the much larger giant - it was an incredible experience and I would not exist without her Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs is a description of a joke with Wozniak almost to the end. through the blue box in the middle of the night was summoned to the Vatican and to talk to the pope, as well as Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> I called on the status of the members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to talk with the U. S. diplomat, and it was not until just before the phone woke up and the Pope himself, with a pair of laughter and put the phone down. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As he fell in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> When he was 12, and has been looking for spare parts to build Power, found in the number of Bill Hewlett and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Not long after their 20 - minute interview was Jobs secured summer jobs in the company of Hewlett - Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> `` `` Incredibly has affected me. it was the only company, which at that time was recognized, and shaped my view of what the company is and how to treat their staff. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Jobs later became one of the employees at HP, who visited the company &apos;s research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw `` the first desktop computer, which was ever produced &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was the size of a suitcase, CRT monitor and I fell in love with it at once. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> As a teenager I in HP moved higher and higher, hanging around the computer and began to write programs. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> What makes innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> In a few places, Jobs during the conversation he speaks about how to invent new products on the run. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> In the early days of his career, when he started to sell a printed circuit boards, one customer said that for him by a computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He had only paid 30 days, during which he had to invent, complete and deliver the cash facility. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in the development of the computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> `` I remember, we were quite fiercely fought... shouting at me, that it would take five years [a mouse, which would cost USD 300], when I got tired, I went out and found a designer. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later, we were able to make perfectly reliable Mouse for $15. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> How big companies out of breath: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs has predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision would falter and lose their share of the market. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> `` Let &apos;s just say that you are working for IBM or Xerox, so you are doing better copiers and printers, and what&apos; s next? &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> Do you have a monopoly on the market, so that the company had the company could not be more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> At the moment it is ruled by a sales and marketing, so that firms run by people who are in charge of this, as the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision - making process. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> Technological genius, who led the company to its solid position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about the good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge is essential. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That &apos;s exactly what happened in the company of Xerox. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> The company Xerox could own virtually the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It could be ten times bigger than it is, could be the Microsoft of the 1990 s. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The victory, however, to create a defeat. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> As he takes innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="1649"> `` Between good and excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and how the great idea develops, it will be changing and growing. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1650"> During that time, she will learn a lot. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> You have to go to a number of compromises - some things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories do not make. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> You have to remember always 5 000 things - different concepts - and put them together... </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Finally, is a matter of taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and, in a way, he &apos;s trying to reflect on what they are doing. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> I have never been ashamed of it, it &apos;s a good idea to steal. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The company Macintosh was so amazing, and successful, therefore, that the people who worked in it, they were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and it happened at the same time as the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> If it had not been for computers and new technology could be amazing things in different sectors. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case in court </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day when the Supreme Court held behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether to accept the challenge to the law on health care, President Obama &apos;s two of the justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court to take part in the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine justices gathered to discuss the submitted proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the direct experience of cases, the action was brought by 26 states are questioning the radical overhaul of health care, which last year approved by Congress - the law, which mobilized the conservative activists around the world. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judges agreed that action heard. in March is expected to 5, 5 - hour meeting, the outcome of which, moreover, even more agitated presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at the time of the decision will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> A lawyer who will stand up to the Court and will seek to achieve a rejection of the bill, will most likely Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under the leadership of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has long years in defense of conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The company, which has sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade association calling the law, known as the National Federation of Independent Business. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of a stake in the huge financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held in a Washington hotel for several hours after the debate on the topic of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> He attended, in addition to the other, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed the law on health care. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> And the marketing of the guests? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> It is nothing new: this pair of judges to the Federalist Society attended for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And certainly not to do anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges released from the obligation to comply with the code of conduct, which are subject to lower the federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If not, it would be their behaviour was subject to the principle of C 4, which says that `` the judge may participate in events that are related and other organisations are taking in order to obtain funds, however, the judge may not be the speaker, a guest of honour, or may not be appearing on the programme of action. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two law firms - acting in the case, and also the company with a huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to alerted activists calling for ethics in government. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> `` This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some of the judges that the Supreme Court is under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, &apos;&apos;said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> `` The judges were drinking and had dinner at a social lunch together with the legal representatives, who are waiting to be tried in a court of law. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and assistance in obtaining funding through this action undermines his feet all allegations of bias, which is unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas against his critics have shown little understanding and told them that they also without problems combining their legal obligations with those groups, such as the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> Thomas&apos; s wife, Ginni is a conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly of Justice Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan has worked as the Attorney General for the government of President Obama, when he appeared before the court of the first protests against the law. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Critics of the Kagan to push him to waive the participation of the case, and says that, at the time for the fight, so much so that now could be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan seem to be preparing to resign. </seg>

<seg id="1685"> The airline Emirates ordered 50 dvouuličkových jet aircraft, a Boeing 777 with an option to buy another 20. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The company also sells six Boeing Boeing Dreamliner airline Aman Air, which collects more than USD 1 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, most of it is no cause for celebration. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, if the company aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record 18 billion, it is something else. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> As well as an important message is that, where the company Boeing won the contract: the Middle East, expanding a gold mine for future orders for aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> According to the forecast, issued on Monday, the Chicago company, estimates that the airline in the Middle East will be in the next 20 years will need 2 520 aircraft worth $450 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> The company Boeing on the weekend announced its biggest order in history, what concerns the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 dvouuličkových jet Boeing 777. </seg>

<seg id="1697"> `` The quality of the customer is very high. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines in the Middle East is one of the nations of oil. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - the most detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the largest costs - is so crucial, because the country itself to higher oil prices. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> It is important, because it is not as likely as other airlines that could cancel or postpone orders for aircraft because of the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> `` They are as natural protection, &apos;&apos;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The contract from the airline Emirates strengthens the position of the company Boeaing on the market with a wide body and brings to the company Airbus SAS, which had wanted to try to break the dominance of Boeing to its transport model, the A 350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The victory of Boeing comes four months after representatives of Airbus announced that the deportation of the first flight of the A 350, which is a direct competitor to the 777 - 300 ER. </seg>

<seg id="1711"> `` They threatened to our candidates, members of the group for a survey of public opinion... they took the ballot box, built roadblocks... and leaving people to vote on an order for the PRI. </seg>

<seg id="1713"> Plans, however, a quick return to power and victory in elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI hopes to win even in July in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> It seems that Vallejo beat Calderonovou, which only the day before the election, only very close. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of his brother &apos;s National Action Party, or Mr., refused to Vallejona recognised as the winner. </seg>

<seg id="1726"> Bank of the ADB calls on Asia, to help to save the eurozone </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Bank of the Asian Development Bank called on China and India to be ready to help to rescue the euro zone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise, it could lead to an overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, director - general of the bank ADB, based in Manila, said that two of the fastest - growing economies in the world must `` do everything in its power &apos;&apos;to assist the rapid recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned of the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China] all the problems are `` too, &apos;&apos;and said that the asian financial aid in combination with the leadership and resources to help stave off the long - term, the collapse of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> `` We are all in this together. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1731"> `` So to anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis, &apos;&apos;he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> `` Asia is perhaps to some extent protected, but it certainly is not immune. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> `` So if China and India can help, we should do. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> The association is already several months severely tested a severe debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In the last days of the borrowing costs of Italy dangerously increased and the heads of government of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears of the world economy back into recession, and there were calls to the newly prosperous the leading economies together and to help find a solution to the eurozone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag predicted that all asian aid will be targeted by the IMF, but noted that the mutual aid - as the purchase of bonds to fund the bailout of the European Union, the institution of the european financial stability - the asian partners of european countries to provide more negotiating capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, India &apos;s minister of commerce, said that `` India can do, &apos;&apos;to help the euro area, because of its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and dry up inflow of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> `` No one wants to the eurozone remained fragile and unsettled, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> `` We are facing a difficult task, and we have to maintain a high level of growth. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1741"> `` It &apos;s not about an alternative, it is a fact of life, because how else can we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1742"> Others argue that emerging economies, such as, for example, the indian, have nothing to help european economies, when they are forced to confront their own severe economic problems. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain to aid for Europe &apos;s 1.2 billion inhabitants of India, when 800 million of whom live on $2 or less a day. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> `` One might find out that the Greeks goes to retire at 50, and you are taking on the beaches, which they may find it hard to explain, &apos;&apos;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Lee Howell, director - general of the World Economic Forum, similarly, has questioned why they should be indian stocks used to keep well - paid jobs for many of greek citizens in a badly managed and loss - making sectors, such as rail transport. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> Mr. Nag, pointed out that the crisis in the euro area is at risk of `` dangerous domino effect. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1747"> The Bank &apos;s forecast that Asia will occur between 2011 / 2012 to 7.5% economic growth, now faces a `` risk of a downturn &apos;&apos;because of the threats. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> He said that the vulnerable emerging markets must develop plans `` expenditure &apos;&apos;, to be protected from the downturn, and the flow of capital from their economies. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> The warning from the Pentagon on possible cuts in the defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress really put into the boiler, when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget may pose a threat to national security and cause a financial chain reaction, beginning at the Pentagon and the continued over the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly line. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon will have already spend the budget reduction of $450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears the reduction of about 600 billion, if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> `` The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Resort, &apos;&apos;Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the so - called attachment to 23% drop in the standard and the suspension of the many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> `` For such a huge reduction, used this premature manner, it will not be possible to make the most of our building or the ship &apos;s projects - you can buy a three - quarters of a building or ships. moreover, it could lead to serious damage to the other modernisation effort, &apos;&apos;Panetta wrote the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> `` We will also urge separated many of our civil servants, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians forced to go on holiday, to be able to fulfill the requirements. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> `` These changes may shake the faith of those who care about our army and cause serious damage to its readiness. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> Finally, the cuts to touch upon the combat units, said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> `` Although the accounts for the financing of possible military operations overseas, this obstávka directly affect, the operation will be adversely affected by significant changes in other budgets, &apos;&apos;said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> `` There will be cuts even in the contracting personnel, which will result in a delay of a fixed contracts in support of the war effort of our people. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> `` Reduced is paid staff, which would also delayed payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of the legal and political support. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Both senators Panettovi ten days ago, asking for more details on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> `` The consequences of obstávky at the Ministry of Defence could lead to the rapid degradation of the United States as the world &apos;s great military power. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> `` We are strictly against this tough measures, &apos;&apos;the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when Panettův published a letter. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> `` It &apos;s not the conclusion that can live, and it is certainly under it, we do not want to sign. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> `` The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not let that happen. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> `` It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and a fresh warning to increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplify voices calling for the Pentagon &apos;s omission from the list of tightened areas. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta was recently in talks about possible cuts to more and more open, even though he went on his high position in the Pentagon &apos;s long years of experience to the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was getting tough fight. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference organised by the previous week, Defense Minister sketched a picture of what may be his Resort wait - shell of the army, in which, however, will miss the core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> `` It will be like a ship without sailors. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> `` It will be like a brigade out of ammunition. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> `` It will be like the Air Force without trained pilots. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> `` It will be like a paper tiger, as an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission, &apos;&apos;Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> `` It will be like a unit without morals, ready and able to deal with a possible enemy. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> `` The result will be a welcome aggression... &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In the Annex supplied with the letter, McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how will have a reduction to result in `` significant operating risks: the late response to the crisis, the conflicts and disaster; a significant reduction in the drops and deployment around the world; the expected an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Panetta also said that some of the largest defense projects could wait for the closure, including those that are already being tested, even those that are still in the early stages of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> On the list was, for example, a project of the F 35, the planned new bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Marine Corps to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> The suspension of further development and testing of the aircraft, the f - 35 would be over the next ten years would have saved 80 billion, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the army, which is needed in order to deal with potential threats posed by China and other rivals. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to tell a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A glance at recent headlines tells how serious and pervasive are lies and deception in day - to - day life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with accusations that he sexually harassed a few women - both sides claim that the other is lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> Administrators at the University of Penn State were accused of perjury, when he tried to hide it on record that the retired football coach sexually attacked the boy. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy caught as running a microphone says the US president Barracku Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> A lie could destroy his career and shake the stability of many countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and web - based performer Anthony Weiner made a fool of myself, when the publication of the information, which was immediately refuted. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of misusing funds from his campaign to try to conceal his extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And no one will ever forget the media circus, which was raised by Bill Clinton, when he lied during the second period in office of a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> There are many stories of cheating in school and university. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There are cases where teachers give their students test answers, only to make themselves look good in their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> The mentors, who should learn to the contrary, sending out the message that lies and fraud is acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> With many fraud we meet? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Studies show that in a single day lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Let &apos;s assume that many of them are full of lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study showed that people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in the life of lying about three times. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Determining the lies, or `` recognition of lies &apos;&apos;, is the necessary skills, which should acquire each, whether for work or personal reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to that of, say, a charade, when a man says: `` I have got you. &apos;&apos;- rated deception is a serious science, working with the scientific data collected during the last six decades of prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been refuted. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Liar you look into his eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> It &apos;s not enough, said, red or were smirking. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> Of course it is, that &apos;s kind of hard to spot a liar and reveal. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A trained identifier lies can figure out the truth of the sentence structure, small expression on his face, the way the issues and their timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I spent a couple of years of scientific knowledge of large - scale and developing the sector on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is modern skills, which can be easily learn and in today &apos;s complex world, you can really help - especially if your job duties include hiring, the organisation of the interviews, or to the people. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars can read well in the other, let &apos;s let down his guard, steering their emotions and intuitively realize the other party. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> The research, we know that the extrovert lie more often than introvert, that men uttering more `` self - centred &apos;&apos;lies, while women say more lies `` aimed at the other&apos;&apos; - mostly to protect someone &apos;s feelings - that married people lie less often to its partners than single people (of course lies, which they say, tend to be `` outrageous &apos;&apos;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when you are lying. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How do you know that someone &apos;s lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, the normal behaviour of the body. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> It &apos;s called `` the initial observation &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> Thanks to a subsequent findings with the match. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Note the body of his laughter, work with his voice. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know if someone is constantly tapping his feet to wrongly accused of lying in the middle of the meeting will begin tapping his feet. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then try to determine if a verbal and non - verbal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Think of it, but only as a warning signals, rather than as evidence of lies. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People speaking a lie can stop moving his upper body, as he tries to remember his cover story, his film to the door, lean to the east, a marked change of attitude or show `` relief after the end of the conversation &apos;&apos;- exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position, when it &apos;s difficult confession behind them. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> The people conducting interviews often give a false signal, that &apos;s an interview in the end, just to see how it will look like a relief after completion. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> He is also the language of the body. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The story of how the Scott Peterson had a slip of the tongue and used the last time, when he said that his murdered woman &apos;s life, which ran a national search for her body. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Deceivers individuals may also speak bluntly: `` I did not have a sexual relationship with the woman... Miss Lewinsky &apos;&apos;or the difficult question of all over again. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal characters are very small. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Anyone can use a lot of `` mitigating language &apos;&apos;, as is a difficult question: `` well, to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge.&apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In such a response is not really know and are often more warning signal. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic to reveal any lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills, which gives the lie to hunt. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> By using these skills will have a greater chance of that in his personal and working for a liar and a cheat. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The controversial plan for the construction of an oil pipeline will be redirected after a threat to delay the approval of the U. S. government </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which had pitted against the trade unions, but environmentalists - the company with the construction of the pipeline in charge, has announced that it is willing to redirect the project in order to get things moving again. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> The company TransCanada on Monday evening, said that moves the planned route of the pipeline ecologically sensitive Sandhills region in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project was approved. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska governments. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Stupce company TransCanada Alex Pourbax contends that the company is confident that construction of the pipeline will be approved, even though lead another route. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign last week declared that it is postponing a decision on federal permits project, which carried out the study of the possible alternatives, which can be used in the Sandhills region in Nebraska and into an aquifer Ogallala, a huge underground water reserves. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> `` This is really a step forward, &apos;&apos;said Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The new environmental report commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would likely any decision pushed up to the year 2013, one year after the election in the next year, but the authorities deny that played a role in the decision of the policy. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Obama, in a written statement last week described the decision as the application of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and expressed his support. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> The 1, 700 - mile pipeline connecting Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> From the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas by a day pass through 700 000 barrels of oil. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> In this way, it will be necessary to cut 6 states. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> This project is absolutely hates environmentalists, but they love him work crews, which estimated that the work on the pipeline up 20,000 new jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Lawmakers in Nebraska, however, against this plan and would consider introducing legislation that would have forced the company into the region Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> The current study on the environmental impact, commissioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project will only have a negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry, said that the Inspector General ordered a new review of the whole process of the original study, and focused mainly on two issues. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> One was that it hired the company TransCanada lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was in the year 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, in a programme of conflict of interest. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> More then, whether a company that was hired to the original study, the choice, because she had ties to the company, TransCanada. </seg>

<seg id="1913"> The Court approved the `` end of analogue broadcasting &apos;&apos;in Mexico in 2015 </seg>
<seg id="1914"> The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The Supreme Court (SCJN) dismissed the action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against prezidenstkému Decree, which wants to speed up the so - called `` switching off analogue signals &apos;&apos;and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. said, needed eight votes, which would invalidate it. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed their authority when he issued a decree giving the individual steps, which will lead to a transition to digital terrestrial television. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> With this result was rejected by the Senate, and that, therefore, that has not been achieved by a qualified majority of the eight votes needed to court could comment on the constitutionality of or the constitutionality of the decree, which remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> A draft of the judgment by the Secretary of State, Olga Sánchez Cordero is able to declare the decree as unconstitutional, because of all the issues relating to the radio and television &apos;s case, which is under the law for the Federal Commission for telecommunications (Cofetel). there is a breach of the principles of the hierarchy of accountability and the law. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> For the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> With this argument as the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported constitutional dispute in an effort to fight against the Decree.

<seg id="1924"> The analogue signals to digital is one of the biggest changes, which has seen the world in the last years. associated with better use of the radio wave spectrum, better signal quality and more channels. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Believes that delay the change would be to delay the benefit of digitisation, which requires a decision in the case of public interest. digitisation, is not only a technical dimension, but `` it touches also economic, social, political and national security issues &apos;&apos;. </seg>

<seg id="2059"> You will never again repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think that part of it is, therefore, that we have got nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone loves the other songs, because it &apos;s hard to choose which songs we play every night. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> When we got in the repertoire of two of the three songs, which we did not play for a long time, we are focusing on them, and we are also a surprise, because we remember it, why are we so much and that we may have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> So it is for us to show more interesting, and I think that &apos;s more interesting for people. </seg>

<seg id="2065"> When you look back, it &apos;s hard to believe everything that you have done? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, that &apos;s for sure. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a great rock group, and that he is more than 20 years old, it sounds like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We are aware of how much is given to us and moved us, that we can continue to play together. </seg>

<seg id="2070"> We are lucky that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted. </seg>

<seg id="2073"> Each of us was honored to be part of this group, comprising representatives of all the big boys. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising, if there is a movement of the group of friends, it does not happen very often. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> From time to time in the city of the group, but it is much less common, from one of the city once had five to ten groups. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud of that and we are honored to be part of a group of Seattle. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes, with some of the more we play. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. we are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement, which was founded in Seattle. </seg>

<seg id="2081"> Yes, we have 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than the duration of the group. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> I think that, first of all, we are all happy that we are still in this world, and the second, his role is played by the fact that he was interested in each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends, and because of that, we have managed to open the musical journey, which they each enough freedom to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> We believe in each other, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think that it could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to the word fame was not simple. however, thanks to your success, you can do what you like. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find the balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> As we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We try not to go too far on tour, because it &apos;s very easy to fall into the trap of the crowds and the people who love our music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> When you realize that people have come because of the music, he reminded himself to the music, and what you have given her, respect must not get carried away, that you are famous, rock stars that neither of us really did not care. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> How do you remember the next project Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think that we are writing great songs and at the beginning it was glorious. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> As the band &apos;s three years and we have never made any album until after he died Andy (Andrew Woods). </seg>
<seg id="2093"> It was very frustrating, because it took so long. the most important is that, even today, with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who were in a band with us. he was to hear a song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy, as was incredible, as I was with him the axeman. always, it was a joy to work with him, laughing, talking about music or on football and much more. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an incredible person and we are missing. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The band of the Las Robertas will be responsible for in Costa Rica opened the show. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that you know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that &apos;s why you have to be chosen as the warm - up act? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, we sent a video with some of the proposals, and this group we liked best. because we are curious what Las Robertas will offer a live, and they must be very amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why do not always live by changing the words of Yellow Ledbetter? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That &apos;s the question to Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it, and I think that adds the first, what he thinks. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> Who you like a bass player affects? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> A lot of people. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> My first challenge Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski................. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many of them that I could all night to talk about the players who I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How he managed to Pearl Jam keep grunge, even though he is no longer in vogue? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think that we are always all felt slightly from the words of grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When you think of grunge, said the group, which I have mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that have arisen in the same time. and if today &apos;s music, so it&apos; s something great, because it is music to listen to and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At the beginning of your music slightly sinister character and now is more positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> What is behind this change? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> It &apos;s interesting, because I have the feeling that, in the new album is a couple of songs, which are lighter, but also there are songs like the end or just Breathe, which are considered to be a very grim, even though they may be taken as a positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> For both, when I &apos;s Ed played, so I was crying, and they are songs deep in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think that when you grow up and you are in the life of a trauma, you lose someone from the family or friend, these things will affect your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> I also think that you can not be a happy man, and I still do the music. </seg>

<seg id="2181"> The President of the city &apos;s group, the People&apos; s Party PP at City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for `` the building was immediately expelled and put an end to such problems with the relationship, which suffers from neighbors, and with the destruction of the area &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> The President of the Christian Democrat said that before the summer was only one story, but in the last few months, the invaders were in all the floors of the building, and almost all of the apartments, and in one of them even to theft. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this respect, he added that `` it is time to put an end to impunity and be consistent, if it is the actions against civil liability, which occurred in the building. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday the Metropolitan Police also cleared the building in the Nou Barris. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> In 15 hours 30 minutes the police got into the building 35 on the streets of Mont - Ral after what it called for the neighbors, who was seen going into the building four people. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> All four were immediately arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or the mountains? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects of the meeting on the occasion of a procedure, which carries more than the controversy about the fees </seg>
<seg id="2189"> Urban competition for 16 gates again opened the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid - 1980 s, at the height of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government published a number of pamphlets in support of the park Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The leaflet defined the mountain as the Great Park metropolitan Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> What &apos;s more, he was accompanied by a number of comparison with the New York Central Park. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Then, in 1987, CMB, Park is back on the minds of many as the borders of Barcelona Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south, but up (Montenegro) - down (the). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The qualification Collseroly as a natural park is a step in this direction. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Reference is no longer the Central Park, but the Yellowstone with feisty instead of Yogi Bear. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Such was the position until September, when the city announced a mega, consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of the gateways to Collseroly. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Gates, of course, is rather the idea of the park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone is trying to put the gate to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> Here, the only question: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisational, not on the basis of a reflection of the city, the question becomes the central theme of all of the Barcelona architects. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is already the subject as tired as when two members of this old caste elite at a meeting in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it was this act, one of the rare matches between what he thinks three of the architects and předstoupivší university professors. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: competition has merit. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> According to Roldan, after she started a question of the Gulf, `` it should be discussed &apos;&apos;and `` on the side of the mountain,&apos;&apos; so the speech Ildefonse Cerda on green apples out. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> `` We must be based on the principle that the Barcelona in the park &apos;s beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, the availability of. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, `` said the architect, for which the name of &apos;&apos;the gate to the Collserola `` carry&apos;&apos; lexikologickou trap: `` we must not be `` as inputs into the park, but rather as a definition of zones, where it is possible to act &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as well as Roldan and Bayona has experience of the world of urban qualifies the proposal as `` an intellectual challenge &apos;&apos;offering `` a danger&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The danger of `` uncertainty, which today is a project of the public space &apos;&apos;after the experience of the 1980 s, who had been in the area for `` the swan&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first concern is the demarcation of the border, where they should be. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> `` Something to define the means to do is the next step, &apos;&apos;that is, in principle, to move a step further. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> `` It should be borne in mind, the new urban planning and scheduling tool, because the current (with a reference to the Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> If we focus more detail on the question of Modol believes that the valleys Collserola can be considered a `` park &apos;&apos;, but not part of the Barcelona, and that for reasons of pure topographical. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol also reminded that there is already a work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which `` may not end up in the garbage, &apos;&apos;even though it welcomes the fact that the city offers its context, that the project will hit from the `` first time&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> And, in addition, means that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a badge, which allows architects to participate in the debate, but `` doubts &apos;&apos;that it should be just this technical profile, which will create a multi - disciplinary teams (`` it &apos;s all about the skills,&apos;&apos; says), which should be created: `` the architects should be only instruments &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, who gave the name of this game is a complex, because in the papers for the selection procedure is a global vision Collserola: `` it was handed down 16 competitions, which deal with all the axis of the mountains, the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies, which would be on the look and see it as a whole &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has meant that he at least, volunteered for all 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the project of one of the gates may hint at the concept and the definition of an architect of the gate. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his view, the town hall was intended to guarantee that the band immediately above the Rondo de Dalt should ensure the whole length of the zone of equipment, to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino forgave Jonási Larrazábalovi, which will be released </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days imprisonment of legitimate Agent Cadino Red pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the process, in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent in prison for 72 days, and now he will be released after his legal Agent Casino Red pardoned before the second of the criminal court in the District, who heard the case of blackmail, in which he was charged with the brother of the mayor of Monterrey. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the casino Red, Sergio García has published a series of Gil, photos and videos, Manuel Jonás for him to demand payment of economic quotas to City Hall in Monterrey to illegal operation at the back of the house. </seg>

<seg id="2226"> In this place was the 49 days after it was delivered by the regulation on the imprisonment and the public of the Ministry of refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On October 19, he was transferred to the criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmail of the owners of the casino Red amount of one and a half million peso. however, he stayed only a few hours in jail with moderate supervision, because he was threatened with death. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Leaders let him during the stay in urban cells in San Nicolas de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> October 25, he was presented to an arrest, which issued the Secretary - General of the Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that, after two months of investigation was gathered enough evidence to prove the Jonásovu blame. between the evidence includes, for example, the amount of 1.5 million peso representatives of the casino, in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday, the legal Agent Casinos Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appearing to Judge José Luis Pecina and asked for clemency for the brother of the mayor of the region on the basis of it will be able to return soon to freedom. </seg>

<seg id="2236"> Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome said details about the accident, which killed the governor &apos;s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretariat for communications and transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, which killed the Secretary of the Cabinet Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter landed right on the ground with full force, without the pilot would have had a chance to try a forced landing. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At the press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport, said that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot, noted that the climatic conditions allow for years. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> `` Part of which appear to suggest that the unit came several times to contact with the terrain, the wings are caught in the branches of trees 25 yards from where the unit has lost its hull &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Also reported that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore, meets all the requirements for the transportation of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> In addition, argued that, on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of impact, not the country found no parts. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> `` In the search, it was found that part of the plane is located in another place, the aircraft crashed on the continent as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> `` The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meets all the requirements for the transport of persons. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The terrain is the tendency of seven to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> The secretary said that at the moment is the most important to get as fast results. however, the investigation could take several months or up to one year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Gilberto Lopez Meyer, general director of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact, the presidential helicopter General Staff moved cruise speed and the accident occurred on the soft earth to the field. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> `` This supports the hypothesis that, at the time of the accident were the normal cruising operation &apos;&apos;, said. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference the SCT Pérez Jácome named six basis points investigations: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The visual years: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In accordance with the standards of the years he was carried out under visual flight rules, it means that the crew must during the flight to see on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> The weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Reports in AICM given adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with the plane is moving in the direction of the border between the DF and the State of Mexico &apos;s cloud layers at low altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> The chosen route: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is likely that, because of the crew was looking for lower area and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> The location of the crash. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The coordinates of impact and the last of the helicopter from radar agree, it is likely that, before the impact of the loss of control of the disruption of the trajectory of the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The dispersion of the remains of the aircraft on a limited territory: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The information, which is currently available, allows us to assume that the collision occurred on a straight track, and from the side. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> A sketch of the remains of the aircraft suggests that, at the time of the collision to land the helicopter was intact. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The fire or explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> At the scene of the incident were not reported any evidence to suggest that there has been an explosion or fire. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The results of the investigation show that there may have been a few contacts with the mainland. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> During the off - road works were found the remains of the aircraft at a height of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground is, the inclination is from seven to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photographs show the footage, in which is likely to break down along the route. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Information is provided by the elements, which seems to suggest that the helicopter could come in contact with the country in a few places. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a thorough search in the vicinity of the accident, in the territory, which is larger than the territory of the establishment, found the remains of the helicopter, which reinforces the idea that the collision occurred in the state, where the helicopter was still intact. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> Mexico &apos;s Institute of Health Insurance launched the research of the gene that causes obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to develop a gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. research carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN </seg>
<seg id="2269"> Mexico &apos;s Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that the results of research to identify the gene for obesity in children and young. research called `` the genetics of obesity in children and adolescents, &apos;&apos;to get the results on the overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> In the report, the head of the medical research unit in the biochemistry of specialised hospital National Health Center of the 21 st century, Miguel Cruz López, he explained, that was set up by a multi - disciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionist and social workers. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils post - graduate study from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the center of research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> To participate in the research may also the general public, with or without permission. people can come into participating in sports centres IMSS in Valle de México, where he was a Saturday from 8 hours to carry out tests. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He pointed out that the research began in the sports centre Cuauhtémoc (Gulf State) and from the 8 th of October, this activity is also in the sports centre Nezahualcóyolt (east of Mexico &apos;s state). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Once they have obtained data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the sports centre Independencia (south of the federal district) and, finally, in the Morelos (north of the Federal). </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the ingredients and the importance of genetics, with regard to the development of obesity, and traced to mexican children and young people risk factors and the prevention of chronic degenerative disease. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the international day of diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, said that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of the parents, for the application of specific questionnaires about nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The questionnaire will ask also for physical activity and a family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors, which could cause the disease such as diabetes and kidney failure. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> Said that each Saturday, all the parties are anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist circumference), measured the blood pressure, determines the level of glucose, of triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and examined the genes (tries to identify the genes that are involved in causing the child obesity). </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López argued that this research reflects the concern of health professionals over the alarming increase in children &apos;s weight. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &apos;Health survey carried out between 1999 and 2006, have shown that in just six years, only for the boys to the rise in obesity by 77% and in girls of 47%. a dramatic increase in the case of overweight,&apos; says expert from the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> That is one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the presumption that the population of the country is different from other stocks his genetic history. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> Informed that the average Mexican has 65% indiánsko - America &apos;s genetic makeup, 30% of the European and 5% of African. this is reflected in our genes, which are responsible for the development of diabetes and obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> He explained that, in general, genetics, obesity is normally explains as the inability to burn off excess energy they consume (calories), which are stored in the form of fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> He explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that, given the overall assessment of the state of children, which will determine whether the show some overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Said that even the presence of the dark colors (acantosis) on his neck and forearm suggests the likelihood that a person would suffer metabolic problems and předcukrovkovými conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The information is confidential, doctors gave him in writing to parents and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must take to ensure that their children avoid disease. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López said that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary behavior indicating a lack of daily physical activity, the day &apos;s sitting in front of the tv and the use of means of transport instead of walking a short distance. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Overweight causes a caloric intake, the consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with high fat and protein and the genetic burden, which is the subject of this research. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> In the tarmac of UNAM will not be potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the chemistry UNAM creates a modified asphalts with polymers and creating a mixture of having to work better, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If he is right on the pavement, it would not be necessary to repair the nearly 200 thousand potholes after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, which, at the same time, he added, that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even to be completely removed. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture technological cause potholes, which said in part of the International Year of Chemistry, said that under his leadership has modified asphalts with polymers, which should be a mixture of having a similar characteristics as the asphalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resistance, both at low, so at high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example, in some cities in the north of the country has improved. so the functionality and reduce the creation of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the hardest part of the oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with high molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are called malteny. jointly supplying the typical viscoelastic character. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viscoelastic character of asphalt is that, at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost as solid, while at low temperatures has the tendency to break, he added. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but they are changing during the day, according to the weather conditions and temperatures, said an expert on chemical engineering. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> A scientist from the chemistry was that most of the streets in Mexico City is covered with a flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three are mixed with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Among the top layer of the blacktop, made up of a small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> He pointed out that the stone, which is comprised of the cartridge, is covered with asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> During the passage of cars or in the creation of the pressure is not possible, to force in the well. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> If it were a modified bitumen, would be even better, the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> He added that the asphalt cartridge placed last layer called the cloak of soft rock, sand also covered in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Given that this is coming into contact with the rims of vehicles must have greater mechanical power than the cartridge and must ensure the friction of the road. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> Given that, as part of the pavement will be exposed to a large burden, must have a cloak of sufficient thickness and must be wary of the material from which it is made. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factor that should be borne in mind, in particular, the water has had a great impact on the viability of the cartridge. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Once, the ground is wet, the water is spreading in, and it &apos;s hard to get out, it causes a softening of all layers of the street, and the emergence of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> He explained that while creating potholes, as the first shot the film and, after the damage to the asphalt cartridge. damage but there at one point, but it is a slow process, which should be discontinued at the first sign of using appropriate maintenance programs. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> As a member of the national system of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layers of pavement must meet the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden does not exceed. it is the only way we can prevent the emergence of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera said that, as regards the asphalt, we still have a lot of work and research is at the beginning. is worth noting, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are in other countries already available on the market and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use a high temperature. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What was missing from the list of Valle for it to become the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> An analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna obtained the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> Valle so acquires 14. the title of the first vícemiss. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Valle del Cauca again reached on the crown of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with that, that she was on the stage winner, won a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which became the first new vícemiss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Based on the results of last night &apos;s finale in Cartagena, in which she won, and took over the Miss Atlántico, the Department has won 14 of the title of the first vícemiss. Melina, joined the ranks of women from the Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of the winning, but in the end it was declared the first vícemiss. they include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Loren Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The question many asking what was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> The result is a defeat for the big favorite bands, which in all the previous rounds of the show, that is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and the prettiest face Joile de Volgue. these titles have, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who then took the title of Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> One of the key factors, which has ruled that the jury had decided her name only the first vícemiss, is the fact that his answer to the question: `` who do you prefer and why? &apos;&apos;, by Murillo Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> On the question of the candidate replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> `` I read a lot of very, I believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. book, which I most affected in childhood, &apos;&apos;Little Prince&apos;&apos;, a book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the present time I read `` crime and punishment &apos;&apos;. it &apos;s a book, which is part of the global literature, which we all know and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, russian author. this is a wonderful book called `` El ardor de La sangre&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> The answer is not like the term `` kulturalizovat, &apos;&apos;and, secondly, therefore, that the candidate, her individual mentioned in the book. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> After the ceremony, she said, that is at peace and the joy of the outcome: `` the world is wise, what will be, will be. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And you people, read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2325"> One of the other hypotheses is that Valle was destroyed by the position of the champions. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Bogotský reporter suggested that the candidate was from the beginning of the most popular, the most celebrated and it took all the previous price (gastronomy call Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic clothes and the Queen Mother), created the envy of other candidates, stress the Queen, who then on the scene. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> It was evident in the first presentation of the bathing suit on the beach Hilton and during the two shows before the final of the coronation. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although both shone, hinted that she lacked the strength and passion that they showed the face of Magdalena and Atlántico. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a programme of `` home &apos;&apos;on Canal RCN believes that Melinda has won the title of the first vícemiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate, who during the competition more titles left with a crown of the Queen&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle in recent days, more hostile attitude to the media and it paid off. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince the jury of their interest in social work, which are the basis of national beauty contests. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> Only on the edge, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty, stated that they are looking for a woman who is aware of the social needs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> `` In a competition, Miss Colombia beauty alone is not enough, it was to be seen as something more than just a physical beauty is to focus on a social conscience. it is important that candidates before they enter into competition, have been involved in such projects, &apos;&apos;she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> They also speculated that the ballot Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibrosis, which was on the buttocks. but it &apos;s completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, it chose Miss `` natural beauty &apos;&apos;for the healthiest body, diet and physical activity. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, acknowledges that she did not have the best body, that there is a good girl, `` but the problems with fibrosis at the bottom, which, in my opinion, was not too noticeable, her diminished points until the last day &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In the meantime, the reporter Guido Hoyos magazine Cromos believes that, a native of Valle made a mistake when he underwent several surgeries. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> `` Surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle,. </seg>

<seg id="2459"> Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The question of the future of Europe on the programme was not originally, but became her up in the autumn, in particular to party members, who are the policies of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The proposal for the president of the European Commission &apos;s management was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstentions. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> A standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro - european finance minister, leaving room for doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: `` the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only that, Europe is peace, but that the `` nine million jobs depend directly on the euro. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2466"> According to the Chancellor in Europe, `` it is time for change. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty, designed to strengthen the control of the European Union over budgetary policies of the Member of the countries of the euro area, but also that could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, `` in order to give Europe a face &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> That is, in any case, one of the thoughts of the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> It is surely only a little likelihood that all twenty - seven countries in this revolutionary step quickly agree: against the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU, thinks that the same stance also Nicolas Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> But the direction is set. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> As delegates rejected most of the proposal to the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> Led by worries calm climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. and try to get Congress to talk of the `` small &apos;&apos;european states or on the states that are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogance of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Although the proposal on Europe gives one paragraph of the importance of `` the franco - german friendship &apos;&apos;, Angela Merkel, quoted by France. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> Only indirectly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> When reminded that just over two hundred years ago in Leipzig bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats against Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What constitutes fraud at work? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After dropping aid party UMP and the government offensive against the work. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 December in Bordeaux, visit the Office for the provision of social support, where she delivered a speech on the subject of repeated from 2007 on the fight against fraud and redistribution of social solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> To the accompaniment of the offensive, which is based on the will to implement savings in the context of the increased severity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right - wing of the presidential campaign, the right - wing majority wants to concentrate on the job. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose on the staff of the private sector on the fourth day of work before they start taking aid in disease. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Clearly, without the consent of the company &apos;s employee, who had lost four days&apos; wages, then at least 15% of their monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> The measures, which runs the risk of causing a lot of damage, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring about 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures of a symbolic range: to give public employees one day of unpaid work (and still do not have any inability over three days in the private sector). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> While these issues are the subject of the debate, the right - wing majority also triggers the diversity of fraud aimed at abuses tied to the work. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> `` The checks will be much larger and more: if you are caught, you will come back, &apos;&apos;said Xavier Bertrand in the interview given by the station RTL on Sunday 13 November. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth of wrongdoing at work. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> These are the subject of ongoing monitoring since 2002 and political onslaught, which brought its fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are more powerful than elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Let &apos;s stop first in several of the official numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the maladie (CNAM - state health insurance) in 2006 paid more than 237 million euro daily allowance. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in healthcare, in 2008, the daily with their 11.3 billion euro 5% in health - care spending. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Of this amount, 46% of the concerned parent contributions and industrial accidents and 54% of the work, i. e. 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> Therefore, only 2.5% of health - care costs. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> According to a study by a group of Alma Consulting had the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days work versus 17.8 days in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> Average, which carries a certain derogations: another poll published in 2007 in the pages of dealing with the Monster. Com showed that 75% of respondents 40,000 french workers said they had no day of work. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another study, this time by the institutions of sickness insurance, argues that, in the 2010 37.8% of jobs are less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> When compared with their european neighbours, french workers are more than elsewhere, prone to work. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> A study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (the National Research Center), showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence of (for reasons of health or not) oscillate in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> Cheating at work represents only a very small part of the compared to work on the black. </seg>

<seg id="2519"> It should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Commission of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> According to the report, the canadian company &apos;s Canadians who denied the death. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care, and even in the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The canadian company &apos;s idea of the denial of death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians actually accepts the opportunity to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> It &apos;s one of the findings of the widespread reports of the Royal Canadian Company, which included six experts working in different areas, one of which was the ethics law and medicine. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The Commission recommended the government to change the law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, so if this option as necessary for the patient, considered to be competent to take such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> At the beginning of the experts cite a recent independent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada placed on the 10 th place, the study notes that the `` medicalisation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medikalizace yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, telling us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> And despite the wish to die at home, which has the most Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> This applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, the figure is the highest with 86% of those who have died in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> As regards the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report concludes that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide will not change anything. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> According to the experts, who are also subject to all of the countries where they are legalised or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalise causes some kind of abuse in the application, i. e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on the person or mismatched. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> Conversely, P. Jocelyn Downie, a co - author of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference more than numerous cases of these missteps in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is not illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> `` Euthanasia is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2535"> `` Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, &apos;&apos;says Jocelyn Downie. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia </seg>
<seg id="2537"> We all remember that, according to a survey conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010 with 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, because he believes that will allow people to the end of his life to ease their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> And 66% believe that the legalisation of euthanasia will mean that we are sending the message that the life of old or disabled people is worth less. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> As regards the persons who are assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that people should not be prosecuted. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> In the case of the maintenance of or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also on the list of its recommendations to claim that it was in the criminal law states that withdrawal of treatment, for which there is a legally confirmed rejection, is not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The experts also requires that the doctors were trained to obligations to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care, and even in the cases of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, in the case of palliative or definitive cessation of already widely used in the canadian health facilities, the Commission is required to be considered at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedure. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The other experts </seg>
<seg id="2546"> Some experts on medical law has already expressed its reservations on the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian society. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist on the medical law, characterised the position of experts - the signatories of the reports as `` extreme &apos;&apos;, among other things, therefore, that does not restrict the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> `` This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life, which should more than 18 years, could apply to help him commit suicide, &apos;&apos;says Pierre Deschamps, who had studied résumé reports. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report were building the autonomy of the above all other values, which make up the social fabric of society. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> As `` in the company, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> A specialist medical law Margaret Somerville also expressed `` strong objections to the conclusions of the report which described as &apos;&apos;a manifesto for euthanasia&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal Canadian society, especially doubts about data reports concerning the absence of any misconduct in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i. e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="2662"> The italian and spanish rates far beyond the borders of the 6% </seg>
<seg id="2663"> Interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> This morning on Tuesday, italian 10 - year bonds is 6,85% and the return of the spanish 10 - year bonds is 6.2%. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> This tension on the interest rate of the southern european countries, but also in France, continues to reinforce fears of market participants. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> The future of the italian government of Mario Monti strongly called for in the markets time to correct the situation in Italy at risk of illness caused by the value of its debt. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decision taken by the 27 October at the Summit of the euro area will be the `` primary task &apos;&apos;of his government. </seg>

<seg id="2669"> The difference (`` spread &apos;&apos;) between 10 - year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a historic high. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> In anticipation of the eurozone growth </seg>
<seg id="2671"> The statistics say that France has recorded in the third quarter of economic growth of 0.4%, primarily due to the consumption of households, i. e. a little better than expected growth of 0.3%. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> France &apos;s National Institute of Statistics and economic studies, however, INSEE revised downward the number for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> And the truth is that the fourth quarter, economists are worried about the most. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> Of his party during the same period Germany registered growth of 0.5%. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> The first estimates for the eurozone are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Energy policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> The facts must win over dogmas </seg>
<seg id="2678"> If there is a theme that can not grasp on the basis of short - term balance sheets or under the emotion, then it &apos;s energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> The availability and price of electricity, have a direct effect on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is natural that the meeting of the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on the site, which occupies the energy from the core. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will be successful only when they will explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French must establish its position on the objective facts and figures. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> So far, the world of 7 billion human beings, but demographic developments will from now on, by 2050, a doubling of the demand for electricity, to a significant portion of the world &apos;s population of the important part of life. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time, it will be necessary to deal with the lack of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to generate electricity, and may not be necessary to forget about the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate change, which is a subject that is in the process of disappearing from the environmental debate. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident at Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> And that &apos;s why Germany is itself in its decision to refuse to nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> But that is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which is considered to be the right to build only the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some of the countries, will continue with determination in their projects. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States, after the Fukushima decided to expand its fleet of one unit of the restoration of power plant construction of one of the Chernobyl power plant at Three Mile Island. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> If the german model based on renewable energies ever presented as an example of the reality of the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The choice of Berlin, the effect of higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO 2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants to natural gas and coal. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> All of these unpleasant effects to be felt within several months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark deserves to consider. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> European champion in the wind, which takes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of the wind, which are the CO 2 emissions and the danish electricity prices higher by 65%, or 50%, than the european average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Conversely, thanks to the stability of our energy policy will pay our neighbors invoice for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of french households. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in the competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, the french companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be generated strong increases in electricity prices, which would make it the illusion of a declaration on the industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> The price that a large majority of the french refuses to pay, as well as fundamentally opposed to this energy, as polls show. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> We all remember that energy policy of our country to stand up to the industry to 125,000 jobs directly and with 410,000 downstream jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Strong export sector dragged on international markets, a large number of small and medium - sized companies specialised that generate jobs, which can not be transferred to another country. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> If France has decided to leave the core, to a large number of these small and medium - sized enterprises and came about 6 billion euros per year, of which country it acquires the export of nuclear equipment and services. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> The owner of the power plant, a nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years, while it was planned Bankruptcy his producer? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> In the resolution of the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic source of energy production, and that there is no evil. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The development of the installations of low CO 2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by the french industrial group Areva is indicative of complementarity sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carried out a rigorous and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of new power plants. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, to the idea of safety in the blood. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> For fifty years recognized the nuclear industry three of a serious accident. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> One in Three Mile Island occurred in conditions of normal operation and remained without human victims, and the consequences for the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In Chernobyl drama caused the concept of the reactor and inexcusable human error. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will take the lessons learned from this accident, just as it did in the previous two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The fruit of this step and co - operation between french and german authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and developers is that the reactor type EPR is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> While all of the candidates who wish to build a nuclear power plant, it is considered, stop its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered by competitors group Areva and EDF and the release of the way to take the lead in the nuclear development. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate search for the best solutions to the energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations to dominate the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> It is for the economy, immigration or chance? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The policy in the field of immigration, Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the backlog of the police, the courts and the administration &apos;s policy of having been levels, the compatibility of this policy is `` human rights &apos;&apos;to France. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently it was the administrative harassment, which is the foreign students, which had become the current, the Interior Minister (see list Libération from May 23) said that France `` does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But so far the only rarely discussed at an angle of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> I must say that in this area is a very broad consensus between left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> On the right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac your statement that `` thousand unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million migrant workers, &apos;&apos;and on the left, Michel Rocard, as in the 1990 s, said that France `` can not take all the poverty of the world&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> In 2005, he was the fear of invasion of hordes of polish plumbers to the french territory of shared the left and right. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden on the economy and the french company. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference lies in the degree of generosity, which is to provide immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> In its programme is François Hollande, limits on banalities, indicates that the joint development will solve our `` migration problem &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in elections, economically, but it is very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As I recall, the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration shaped our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 pp.): between specialists, there is broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that immigrants adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Reducing immigration is crippling the growth and employment. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> Concerns about the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace french workers, especially those less qualified, and create a downward pressure on the wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> But experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants, much more than by supplementing the replacements for the french staff that they carry out the work in sectors with a shortage of staff. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> Few skilled immigrants in sectors that the story of the french staff, and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply of seats. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> The positive impact on wages </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as the surgeon will have trouble with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesthesia, the addition of between the French and the migrants are causing the arrival of immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of french workers. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri so calculated that the growth of migratory movements on the 1% of a long - term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of its immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants between America &apos;s Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants are also in european countries net contributors social systems, on average, at a rate of 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The World Labour Organisation, e. g., estimates that in Germany one immigrant arrived at the age of 30 years will bring in my whole life in public budgets net contribution (revenue minus costs) 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate, the desire for missing percent growth `` with bared teeth &apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> The teeth to deter immigrants to effect the reverse. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe invented democracy, to think about european democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a rare and very fragile goods. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The european continent ought to remember, nevertheless, that her in Athens before two thousand years has experienced in the course of the 20 th century the tragedy of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust and the Gulag, but also by Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Greece. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some people may believe that, in order to democracy finally triumphed over their foes, will be enough to carry out the election and make it the most direct way. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> He knows, however, since Napoleon, that it was the ease of thinking. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The general election law, even though it is a condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and could become `` instrument of oppression, &apos;&apos;as he once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: the public space, public spirit, values, the organisation department and control of the power of education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis of Europe, which we are experiencing, it is the economic crisis, but it &apos;s just so, since the beginning of the crisis policy and democracy. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The errors of the greek referendum - yes - no will have in this respect the value of double revelation: the discovery of the need for a return of political power, but also reveal a dramatic sense of his inability, his inappropriateness. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence must be thinking, so that it can be overcome. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> The truth is, the front line of the democratic contest today moved and that many of the republican fighters firing in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain, if we require a number of national referenda organised by necessity, and in a disorderly way. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A blank issued by the absolute monarch or jump with bound feet into the depths of the nationalist: what kind of selection for the citizen! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we do not want the guillotine, but common, a fully - fledged, peaceful and continuity of selection and democracy, this time at the european level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> The crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, nor is he did not know where the stop - because of the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It &apos;s all of Europe - eared prior to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which are suffering from their incompetence and their lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is not the whole of Europe, which is on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> About the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it &apos;s all of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty and each of its peoples. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> It is urgently needed to return to the european project democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> As the only together will be able to reduce the weight of their debts of Europeans, to get rid of the markets and investing in the future. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis will assume the decision at european level, which can not be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise would have led us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After what we have long fought against the motion of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all now calls the european economic government. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> So be it. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such people, it would be a folly and new cul - de - sac. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We have to take on a new stage of the building. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to `` be &apos;&apos;Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution in the interests of the could not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> The lesson is to continue. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> It will be only by building a Europe more politically democratic, and a real european democratic sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Let us be Europeans, to build a Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2807"> According to the station, Radio France Internationale (RFI) are interested in investigating a particular number two: one leads to Nigerians, who took a long stay in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to the man, who is said to have close to AQMI and sect. </seg>

<seg id="2859"> Remote the Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and the Baltic Sea to work. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> They must deliver gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> Gazprom, the russian gas giant, to this event due to celebrate. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, the last Tuesday, attended the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline, which under the sea directly linking Russia and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> Symbolically, german Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned jointly control valve around the entrance of russian gas to western european network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> This new pipeline flow each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion of additional cubic meters of russian gas pipeline on the length of the 1, 224 km of the region of St. Petersburg and the federal state Mecklembursko - Western Pomerania. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> The pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount that is equal to the entire french consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And there are no longer recalls the chance to build a third line of the gas pipeline on the same route. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom is the timely completion of this huge construction of the nature of the victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project strongly protested against Poland and the baltic countries. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Nord Stream, in fact, to supply gas directly to Germany without being held around the country a third state (Poland or Ukraine). </seg>
<seg id="2870"> At the same time, these two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of pushing for Russia threatening to shut down access to western european markets, it becomes more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Hard to Warsaw, when she likened the Nord Stream for `` new of the german - soviet Pact &apos;&apos;, with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> Does it mean that it is a politically sensitive topic. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe through its support for the russian project in it has gained greater security for their purchases. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But it is at the cost of weakening of Europe &apos;s energy, because the project has created a rift between Europeans from the east and west. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia had barely five years ago to promote his vision of a close alliance between Russia and the rich western countries with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are coming to an end. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> `` This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, the new line, which connects us organically, &apos;&apos;said François Fillon at the opening of this pipeline, and has demonstrated, at what point are large gas contracts things both political and economic. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All of this explains the leaders of Gazprom &apos;s present in large numbers in Lubmin, the place of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical offence. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> An undersea pipeline is made of steel, cement, in order to protect the marine vessels. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Lies at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> In its construction was necessary to avoid the originating from the time of World War II. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> `` For the safety of them had to be almost a hundred removed or destroyed, &apos;&apos;says Jens Mueller, a spokesman of the Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> It should also be increased measures for the protection of flora and fauna. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The pipeline is a long metal snake as 242 Eiffel Tower, which at its full length is nowhere to be suspended or valves or stations maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> One of the platform to be constructed in the vicinity of Sweden, but the project leader rejected it, when the swedes were just a few greedy see the russian state company, how to permanently settle in their coast. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> `` In the event of failure to stop the gas for less than 1 minute, &apos;&apos;says Jens Muller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the case of the leaking gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> But this case is builders considered unlikely, he welds was designed so that the leak was once every 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The gas pipeline from the outside by a robot submarine drawn by ships, while the interior of the gas pipeline is controlled by the device, which is circulating inside. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> This device cigar - shaped by an average of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the line and is led by gas. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> In goal after three days of travel at the speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information about the possible distortion of metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> Remote gas pipeline is designed to work for 50 years, without any need to repair. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The circulation of the gas is simply to ensure the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in goal. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> For the implementation of this project joined forces five companies. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The remains of Gazprom, which holds a 51%. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> It was joined by the german company E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the dutch company Gasunie and the french group GDF Suez (9% each). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> The five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> The company has its headquarters in the town of Zoug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom subsequently this company rented for five years, which can be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> `` Gazprom will profit from a total capacity, whether it is the reality of the gas any &apos;&apos;, explains Jens Muller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was assured of 30% of shareholders and of 70% of the bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total cost of the work would have to 7.4 billion euros for the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For the group GDF Suez and investment costs rise up to 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> But the minority shareholders are aware that their costs will return, because of the risk of takes only Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> A gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy beach with pine forests. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The valves high 15 feet is the exit gate of the gas. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors measure the temperature, pressure, and other characteristics of the gas, before he was transported to the german gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since the last Tuesday of this terminal accepts every hour of one million cubic metres of russian gas. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million. </seg>

<seg id="2912"> The italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of candles. </seg>

<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010 have increased sales by 26% in the last year to 12.7 million. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> The situation is far away from the production of the early years, when there were only 3 000 notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine exceeds the italian border, and exports are up to 70 countries from France to the United States. </seg>

<seg id="2934"> Why is such a high proportion of the unemployed disabled workers? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> Around 19% of people looking for work. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today &apos;s opening week 15 for the employment of disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite the proactive public policy established in 2005 is the percentage of unemployed people still more than twice that of the average, i. e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It &apos;s a depressing? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> `` No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, director - general of the Association of Adapt, which organises the week for the employment of people with disabilities. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> `` The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> `` At the time, it was the percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> `` However, it is still much to do. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said that for unemployed people, there are still many obstacles before entering the work. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> This is an older person: 37% of the more than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have low qualifications: 80% have graduated from high school and from 2.3 million students of the university &apos;s only 10 000 handicapped. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> And finally - long - term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicated by the return to work and that they are `` core of the problem &apos;&apos;, according to Christian Grapina, Director General of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992, in order to help businesses to adopt disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So, as far as the objective of the brake. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Left, ways of thinking, of course, but too slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> The study carried out in April by IMS - Entreprendre pour la Cité finds that the managers are `` low level of knowledge about disabled people &apos;&apos;with `` an exaggerated idea of persons in a wheelchair and psychiatric or mental deficiencies&apos;&apos;. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The result is that private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from that, in order to achieve the objectives of 6% to employ disabled workers laid down in the law of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The last known figures, which come from R. 2008, the equal of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> `` Now we move around 3%, &apos;&apos;says Pierre Blanc, director - general of the Organisation of Agefiph responsible for collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> The proof is that the number of `` fined &apos;&apos;businesses, as well as the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit companies to 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> `` The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, says Pierre Blanc. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> `` But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large companies. &apos;&apos; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Labour only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 staff are employed by disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 200 employees. </seg>
