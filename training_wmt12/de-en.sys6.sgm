<seg id="1"> No amendment liberating for Tymoshenko with Parliament </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request, as part of an amendment to the Penal Code to abolish those paragraphs, have been sentenced on the basis of the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The new regulations, which would have the way to free the imprisoned Expremierministerin can pave, rejected the delegates at the second reading of the request for mitigation of punishment for economic crimes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Timoshenko was sentenced in October for the completion of an alleged adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The verdict is not yet final, in December to the appeal of the convicted are pending before the courts. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Timoshenko himself described the ruling as political revenge of the regime and the West has raised the suspicion of bias, the process of the court. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The application, Section 365, was sentenced on the basis of the Expremierministerin to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies. </seg>
<seg id="8"> 226 votes would have been necessary to its adoption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Libyan victory </seg>
<seg id="10"> The history of Libya&amp;#39;s struggle for liberation or rebellion Libyan already knows their losers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried at an undisclosed location in the desert, and without him the war is over. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now just have to define the winner. </seg>
<seg id="13"> As usual it in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which - the moderate or radical. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The National Transitional Council is known to customary law of the Shari ʿ a, from which one has even now to God a certain idea. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Libya would become a country without crime, as for theft in short chopping off the hand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Women also should not forget the thought of emancipation soon, any apostates are executed, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of a single dictator, the Company is of mutually warring tribes united in the future from the Koran. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In short - in Libya will rule an order that this country is hardly conceivable, and in particular hardly desirable. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But - our lifestyle is now not even the only objectively and probably not the best fit and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could ever help the infidel dogs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> May well serve as an excuse just the fact that the air strikes of NATO is not by any General from America, but by God himself were conducted, whose omnipotence after each successful hit was praised. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The winner in Libya? The West is not among them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We took part only in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of the dictator in the person of a political ally, without any benefit that would have entailed. </seg>
<seg id="24"> After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we have seen better from a military occupation of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thus, the locals are going on a concern - namely, the expulsion of the Crusaders. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Do the oil companies but without the occupation of black gold at a bargain price? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Probably not, and so the West can finally boast of his selflessness when it comes to legal protection of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If they will not be the Shari ʿ a representative ruin. </seg>

<seg id="71"> A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran on Tuesday formed a living shield around it to the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed. </seg>
<seg id="72"> So they wanted to make known that they are willing to protect their country&amp;#39;s nuclear program, if necessary, to their own lives. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented recently in its report that Iran had abandoned its efforts to all appearances, not a nuclear weapon long ago. </seg>

<seg id="77"> The menu is an obese child: It is not breakfast for dinner and eats meat </seg>
<seg id="78"> More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have a weight problem, where 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of children are overweight. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Recent surveys proved - Obese children often come from families with unhealthy lifestyles. </seg>
<seg id="80"> It shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he grows up, and the examples are that surround it. </seg>
<seg id="81"> On the tables of obese children sausages are up to half of the table more often than in families living in those of normal weight children. </seg>
<seg id="82"> More than 19 percent of overweight children had the day before the awareness campaign under the slogan &amp;quot;Obesity is not a coincidence,&amp;quot; French fries for dinner. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families with Fatty and sports is not one of the favorite pastimes, which also affects the majority of today&amp;#39;s students - only 15 percent answered that their parents at least once in the week, time of active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey was conducted last year by the end of the school year, while nearly 900 children were interviewed from elementary schools in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> That was the second year of the Action &amp;quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&amp;quot;, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Previously participated in the project more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8 Some classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &amp;quot;Only half the children surveyed cited, for example, five times a day, breakfast-mode second breakfast-lunch-snack-food dinner - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet&amp;quot;, is one of the survey results. </seg>
<seg id="90"> No breakfast and sausage for dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts point out that even relatively minor, such as the regular breakfast time, the family, are important for the healthy development of a child. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic have breakfast but only 23 percent of the families of the students. </seg>
<seg id="93"> And - in most families, breakfast each by itself. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Worst of all was the finding that breakfast is not at every tenth family. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The breakfast is regarded as the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The survey test brought to light, among other things, that in families of obese children consumed more often unhealthy fries. </seg>
<seg id="97"> And almost everyone - regardless of weight again - drinking sweet sodas each day (70 percent) </seg>
<seg id="98"> While driving more than 40 percent of the children&amp;#39;s sports, but only less than half of their parents do - namely, only 15 percent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Imagine your own menu together </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together out of options offered by their own appetite and think diet. </seg>
<seg id="101"> &amp;quot;What do prefer Czech children aged between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favorite foods were many desserts, meat dishes and of course desserts. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &amp;quot;It is alarming, especially the huge popularity of sweet lemonade,&amp;quot; is emphasized in the final report of this survey. </seg>
<seg id="104"> At lunch, which is the main dish, pasta won just ahead of poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Legumes liked the children and hardly even the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Turning toward the health </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits when they get correct information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> &amp;quot;In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture&amp;quot; Obesity is not a coincidence, &amp;quot;filled out, was in many cases, a clear shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition,&amp;quot; noted in the results of the project mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="109"> What is striking, this was the case with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children crossed the questionnaire also much more than poultry or fish main course of the day and were willing to eat less food or sweet dumplings. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Professionals say - a stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the introductory article on how to get stylists, I had a bit of grumbling that it was a bit too much material to start with. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Since I had no idea at all what is to come. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the apparel problematic characters and a seminar on how the &amp;quot;on the square&amp;quot; is running. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It will get worse. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer the test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, he is still full. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time we had a debate with director Alena (the course takes part, not a single man), how to dress a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And after all, most of us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> Some people have too short a neck, the others are too boyish figure without proper curves and some chubby. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is for the stylists to cover up broad shoulders visually to extend the neck or conjure the necessary curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We were also given tips on how to make a woman like Jennifer Lopez type - ie large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging attracts, without being too provocative acts. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If so great as the difference between waist and hips, the skirt or the pants do not really fit, you should at least have a piece of tailor-made. </seg>
<seg id="124"> This one will not regret it, because well-fitting clothes is simply priceless. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailored skirt makes you feel that is much better than in an off the shelf, the high and constantly slipped, protruding into the waist, etc. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Boyish figures can get away again, to wear clothing with folds, bulking, appliqué, embroidery, or gathering. </seg>
<seg id="127"> With this amount of information and character types, I&amp;#39;m glad I have time for a whole week, I leave everything to thoroughly go through your head. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And yet I am afraid that it is applied in view of the homework is not to create almost. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the students got a celebrity that is assigned to come up with matching outfits for them - day wear and evening wear. </seg>
<seg id="130"> We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and the corresponding figure type. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I want Miranda Kerr &amp;quot;attract&amp;quot; that you may know from the campaign, Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> Inside, I rejoice, because this is for me personally a lot better than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera to dress, which has in recent times probably gained a hundred pounds (okay, that&amp;#39;s a bit excessive), or the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The garments we should cut out from magazines or search the Internet, print, and then graphically edit. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the &amp;quot;mood board&amp;quot; as the whole result is known, then come to our own personal style and our relationship to graphic design for print. </seg>
<seg id="135"> Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphical side of the styling. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The stylist takes the models that is not only physically, but also designed the so-called product page in the journal (according to specific requirement, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> Of these we told the stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But the return on the Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This means that a stylist have a good overall view must. </seg>
<seg id="140"> The figure was with information on types of stuffed spiced same lecture Saturday by three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> by Jan Pokorný stylists, fashion designers from Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And be able schickter stylist with a single piece of clothing in many different ways to work. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word is versatility. </seg>
<seg id="145"> So you can wear as a trench coat over jeans as usual, just like a T-shirt or jacket, you can also wear it on the naked body, to wear high heels and wear it as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It&amp;#39;s enough to roll up our sleeves and collar or equal to the whole look is very different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> &amp;quot;Play with it,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most came to me but the next Council Situated: &amp;quot;First you have to know the rules perfectly.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="149"> &amp;quot;Thou must not until then she hurt her,&amp;quot; said Jacob. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Finally, I realize why we need to cram all these theorems, which can be combined with what and why, even though you might see in fashion magazines often quite different. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Not to mention fashion shows all over. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to photographer Ben I know now that a stylist have prepared a lot more clothing options must be when he finally photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So you have a fashion story with ten pages (pronounced ten outfits) to be prepared and make up at least fifteen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the clothing in the photo used in combination with other accessories at times look very different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With all this so you have to expect in the design of the outfit. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The image and style, sometimes for half the success that we confirmed, Jan Pokorny. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Because you need spend only a Madonna, not just to watch a brilliant singer, have transformed the image and marketing a world star. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a stylist more reserved about. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even famous people often consider it waste of money for (the main thing is that I bring something, what I look like this is secondary). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if someone already can be styled by us, then we should expect that he or she imposes on us are likely very different (smaller) size, as he or she needs in reality. </seg>
<seg id="161"> Then you need to google then only to establish with certainty that the tabloid press, writes the appropriate celebrity to have taken off again, or, etc. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to the heart, not to believe that a stylist to only focus on fashion and then the outfit &amp;quot;assemble&amp;quot; needs. </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work he has to communicate, especially with the people he styled and he must be a shrewd psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> People to assess themselves and are without pandering to his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> &amp;quot;If we ordered any manager to sift their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can not dispel all her wardrobe and say - my God, that&amp;#39;s terrible.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="166"> &amp;quot;You have to find at least some commendable things for which we suggest what you can bear it,&amp;quot; says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He also showed us very specifically what needs to include such a so-called &amp;quot;space bag&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="168"> So that&amp;#39;s a bag that is buttoning at the waist and in which one carries all the necessary Proprietäten with him. </seg>
<seg id="169"> Besides such clear terms, such as scissors, paper rolls for hair removal or safety pins, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist helps when photographing products, such as handbags and hats off), special clips, which is behind the clothes gathered if it is too large (pins or other terminals are prohibited, so the fabric is not broken) and of course sewing. </seg>
<seg id="170"> We need to listen but not only, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick to shoes properly. </seg>
<seg id="171"> Even when shooting in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> O we are stuck and stuck ... </seg>
<seg id="173"> With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so they were not even damaged. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So you have to really act skillfully. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario pleased me by praising my &amp;quot;creation&amp;quot; with no restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The aforementioned skill is in fact not exactly my forte. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All this was only the fraction of what we heard during the second weekend continuation course. </seg>
<seg id="178"> One thing has become clear to me - the styling is dedicated to professional level, is not child&amp;#39;s play. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Need for Speed ​​V: &amp;quot;The Run&amp;quot; - the illegal race across America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Review </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally careless driving is a series of entirely avoidable, amateurish error routine trip to the morning shift. </seg>
<seg id="182"> Although it managed to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what good does it matter if no one had obviously want to do a bit more. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Even before he came to the counters, the new sub-awakened with the subtitle &amp;quot;The Run&amp;quot; high expectations. </seg>
<seg id="184"> But he promised that even elderly game series &amp;quot;Need for Speed&amp;quot; move back a little into a new dimension in the playable demo examples, he actually seemed to be not only one of many action-driving games. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious to know what the fitted passages in which the main protagonist of the car rises and goes away. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as it is already used with NFS, is ultimately much different than we had expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Sure - there are potentially quite decent arcade racing, but overall the game from a few unnecessary errors is diminished, which in this series are more or less been a few years present. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So there are really no more errors, but rather a sign of laziness in principle incomprehensible game developers. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure starts out very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> First one is introduced into the story, the main character Jack has some problems of a personal nature, the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America to participate through. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, then on the West Coast, you sit behind the wheel - with the task of being the first to be in New York. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that each race will be held at a different distance and that the stages take place in different, different enough and interesting environment. </seg>
<seg id="195"> It has not a moment the impression that would offer the same game over again. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some environments are to be considered still very pretty, although the technical level of video does not extend beyond the earlier parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> So, nothing earth shattering. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscapes or high up through the snowy landscape more visually pleasing. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety in the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, will be caught in a desert storm, which severely restricts the vision. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains again you have to watch like hell that you will not be buried by an avalanche. </seg>
<seg id="202"> By the way are pretty well built, the individual race in a row. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Although only a few, but they are. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a while we tried so to pass the prescribed number of enemies (basically a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the clock), then expect a more personal duel with a single counterparty. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And to that interferes even the police who want to screw up one&amp;#39;s whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="206"> A novelty are passages in which Jack is leaving the car. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It&amp;#39;s more about some interactive animations, where Jack runs away from anyone, and where the player must help him by pushing the right buttons at the right moment. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So, nothing complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Not surprisingly, however, that the game is much less of such passages, as one would expect (well actually only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> Ultimately, this is the cause rather an advantage, because this element has at least a chance of being boring - it belongs in the context of the foregoing, the elements that make the game more varied. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The driving model walks in the footsteps of the previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That is, seen from today&amp;#39;s point of view, it pulls out but no trees, on the other hand, could not be said, it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Those looking for realistic simulations may need to look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But an action-packed racing the local drive model will continue to meet pretty well, although you might find the competition better. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then, if everything is fine. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems emerge only after some time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the driving model is the collision model is not quite OK </seg>
<seg id="218"> Is a game of this kind can hardly be expected that it calculates complex deformations and collisions, but if you are practically no impact on any object idea how the car handles, then obviously not all right. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Case in point: When overtaking or passing close to oncoming cars, &amp;quot;touches&amp;quot; to the other cars in some places only slightly, in others, almost identical situation to get there but skidded and turned wild pirouettes. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or drive the cart to the same crap. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to restart the system but does nothing further from it&amp;#39;s definitely annoying. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The restarts are solved: if you have a total loss, or far away lands of the track, then looks back at the game the last clue of the route. </seg>
<seg id="223"> But - in every race you have only five restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> If you have exhausted it, everything goes all over again .. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The restarts are therefore more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but if you prefer not rely on it. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes helps but not even the restart, there&amp;#39;s no alternative but to learn the critical section from the head. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Extremely unpleasant, that is the same thing happens often in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some curves have to pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere, one encounters in the appropriate place &amp;quot;civilian&amp;quot; cars always in the same configuration, regardless of whether it later as the first or fifth, formerly five seconds or a minute is. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This is annoying, especially in situations when one sees that the opponent&amp;#39;s play before a two oncoming cars pass by, but even there until you arrive, the car has been in a position such that they avoid or slow down. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it does not matter when you get there, everything that is designed so that it comes close to this situation, always at your fingertips. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opponents are even more advantages. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken in the same place the same opponents again and again regardless of the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> On the craziest this is the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The counterparty must have a pass here, obviously hell-bent on. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And then if he is ever before you, then he takes a course, the point of view, so that there initial runs his own car a few times to smithereens. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and thrilling but this intention is so clear that it spoils the pleasure of a fast game. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And that&amp;#39;s a shame, because despite a simpler model is driving the overall game quite entertaining and action-packed places so that you almost do not know where one is the head. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And basically do not care what &amp;quot;responsible&amp;quot; thing is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the location of the race in a way that can never get bored, or something completely different ... </seg>
<seg id="240"> An unusual idea is also to change cars during the race. </seg>
<seg id="241"> One must not overlook the gas stations along the route, since this is where you can change the car, although sufficient in most cases, the car that you currently have. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the large American sedans for the straight highways and super-exotic sports car for the technical tours, for example, on the switchbacks in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand with the mode of the game&amp;#39;s story mode, and the tasks (challenges) - so the race in the individual localities, which are known from history. </seg>
<seg id="245"> There are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile to gain that is common for the problems (challenges) and the story. </seg>
<seg id="246"> To reach the higher level driver, must be open to different objects: the car started right up to the backgrounds for your profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is the same with the online feature Autolog, which compares with others their own results obtained with those of other players and also provides other collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> One of the more incomprehensible blunders is a situation in the last race in history. </seg>
<seg id="249"> This one comes with the car that is in a subway tunnel (I care), where in the dark on the rails long races (I care). </seg>
<seg id="250"> Look at the speedometer digits between 150 a 200 km / h (because of me), but there comes suddenly from behind a subway and an uncompromising drive to scrap. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editorial we will probably argue for a long time about whether it was a blackout of the game designers or whether we keep the writers for that stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is, in most cases quite appealing, and here and there, even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even more upsetting is that slow for some exciting moments, the refresh rate is and this sometimes quite dramatically. </seg>
<seg id="254"> This applies, however, especially the large number of accidents with Involve, where a continuous FPS benefits anyway. </seg>
<seg id="255"> The sound is far O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In an effort to as wide a scale as possible rather just talk to young audiences, was a soundtrack a la &amp;quot;bit of everything&amp;quot; - but who buys such a game because of the music? </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall impression of Need For Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> If the game would not be diminished by the totally unnecessary errors mentioned, we could say with great conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But as the game seems somehow unfinished. </seg>
<seg id="260"> For a great pleasure, but you should be prepared that this a bug bite with the power of airport lights in the eyes. </seg>

<seg id="276"> EU Ambassador Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="277"> The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and Euro-skeptics </seg>
<seg id="278"> &amp;quot;The Treaty of Lisbon the balance among the different institutions has brought tangible out of kilter.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="279"> I would not expect such a tough war breaks out. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="280"> &amp;quot;It will take five or six years, until things have calmed down and all of their new role will have become accustomed,&amp;quot; Milena began Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its pretty sharp lecture at the Law Faculty. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How serious it&amp;#39;s motto &amp;quot;of course, open to Europe &amp;#39;takes, they showed in the first part of her presentation in which she succeeded in the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that they many a lecturer at the Law Faculty of Charles University would envy you. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs. Vicenová while also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
<seg id="283"> &amp;quot;At first, been criticized, he was too discreet - a gray civil servant who is not such a role has grown, but I must say, it has all the cunning breathing, as well as he has taken up the cause. </seg>
<seg id="284"> &amp;quot;He is a man who contrives to listen to twenty-seven Member States patient to communicate with them and has the particularly clear idea of ​​how it should proceed with the EU. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then she explained in answer to the question: What is God - the European Union? What number should I call? &amp;quot;That is an important step towards unification and readability of the EU&amp;#39;s policy towards countries such as China or India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs. Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda, according to the European Union, lived, lives and intends to live in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The Czech presidency two years ago she described as a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs had weathered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosts the summit for Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The case of the government during the presidency called them big negative factor, the image of the Czech Republic have greatly harmed. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The Czech representative in the EU has to do with full hands. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the ambassador, it was not just the presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has yet to overcome to this day, quite too hectic. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And there has yet to seven-year EU budget be approved, which makes the whole thing just because of today&amp;#39;s economic situation more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether it&amp;#39;s a budget is lean and economical, which sectors get priority in which countries and which are promoted less more - all of that is now on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador also reminded of their own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: &amp;quot;Europe course&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="296"> &amp;quot;If I do not like something, then there are grayish abbreviation, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How should I as a citizen really know whether you conceives in Brussels really crooked or curved cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether we actually want to ban someone the cake of cheese. </seg>
<seg id="298"> It would have the bottom of the EU also used to like to get more Czechs in European Institutions. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Europe of two different speeds or in prospect </seg>
<seg id="300"> In the EU&amp;#39;s ambassador to the Czechs have a reputation of being Euro-skeptics, the more negative, perceive as the positive aspects of the matter. </seg>
<seg id="301"> More annoying is the poor representation of Czechs in European Institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Because many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write Motivierungsbriefe and last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side. </seg>
<seg id="303"> In addition to the successful Czech presidency, they also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4. </seg>
<seg id="304"> &amp;quot;Believe me, when a Pole or a Hungarian and a Slovak comes to me is near, then the Frenchman next to me says,&amp;quot; Hey, what you put there heads together - this is again your V4 &amp;quot;and it makes? a rather sour face. </seg>
<seg id="305"> According to Mrs. Vicenové the EU expected in the future especially tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="306"> As a lot of real, as a &amp;quot;European Federation&amp;quot; she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even at different speeds. </seg>
<seg id="307"> &amp;quot;We have the euro-zone countries and countries outside the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="308"> &amp;quot;We the Schengen area and we have already strengthened the institution of cooperation have.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="309"> &amp;quot;For the first time was told that only the countries should work together, who want and those who do not want to quietly stand aside.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="310"> &amp;quot;There will be more and more of such institutions, which in the end to a strong&amp;quot; multi-speed Europe &amp;quot;boils&amp;quot;, expected Vicenová woman. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect, they also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle according to which all issues must be discussed with implications on the entire EU by all Member States, not only from the countries of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Brand story: </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> If you wanted to find a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most accurate, then this would be the word &amp;quot;longevity&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, although since it was founded a century has passed already. </seg>
<seg id="316"> The basis for this longevity was considering her first boss - ing the visionary Thomas J. Watson. </seg>
<seg id="317"> He already took the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a bit. </seg>
<seg id="318"> His slogan &amp;quot;Think!&amp;quot; became the hallmark for this should happen, the future life of the giants (and also the title of the company&amp;#39;s internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in the year 1935). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of carefully prepared Watsen corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> &amp;quot;For us, of IBM, this means long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was so successful a century, because it has remained true to his principles and does not shy away from changing everything else around it. </seg>
<seg id="322"> This allowed us to transform the course of our first century, technology, business and society. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, &amp;quot;said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the Company on the occasion of the anniversary. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Sophisticated system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson operational as early as the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were among the first American employees paid leave to take out insurance by the contractor plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a elaborate system of pay for the best innovators and distributors. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Equally ingenious are the long-term relationships with their customers by IBM. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was brilliant from the start in the talent - picked as one of the first companies worldwide to IBM any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan on top of IBM in the next year is alternated by a woman - Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> That&amp;#39;s it for thirty years at IBM, so far they took the position of Sales-and marketing and strategy chief. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM makes in recent years so-called on-line brainstorming session from which many future strategies and innovations arise. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No wonder - there are plenty of ideas, so the company is nearly half a million people employed. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inward and outward. </seg>
<seg id="334"> &amp;quot;From the beginning, IBM had more the concept of an institution than a mere technology company,&amp;quot; said the Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> &amp;quot;IBM is not a technology company to solve, but a company that helps business problems using technology,&amp;quot; added George Colony of Forrester Research consulting firm. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company has stressed, there is a difference in the market only to be present or to mold him through this presence directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM - in the States because of its logo familiar &amp;quot;Big Blue&amp;quot;, is grown in a century to one of the largest companies in the world. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product breadth - from servers to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Of all the U.S. technology company IBM has the most patents and has five of his employees were awarded the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> Among his most famous inventions, for example ATMs, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code, or the floppy disk. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With approximately $ 220 billion market capitalization (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second-largest technology company (just after Apple), and it the first time since 1996, Microsoft overhauled. </seg>
<seg id="342"> A look ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations to meet the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy as the experiment with the native operating system OS / 2, the Prodigy online service, or the computer IBM PC Jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> &amp;quot;Business is based on the forward motion, so you can not be emotional tie to the past&amp;quot;, stated Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Therefore, IBM has no problem, its foundations built on different platforms - and if they do not work, they leave again. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Unlike the Microsoft counterpart, which is in principle with its Windows operating system and falls. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> In the benefits of IBM participate in the greatest extent in services, software and hardware involved in each case to one-fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> This hardware in 1990 with a more than fifty prozentigem share was the most numerous. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000, IBM sold little profit abwerfende assets worth 15 billion dollars in the same time, however, it invested $ 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> IBM moves into these investments continue even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time such a tempest over the world. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM, too, did the legacy of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson faithful, who rose in the middle of the Great Depression its investment scope. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far it seems that the company IBM is today&amp;#39;s crisis unscathed. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of IBM shares rose since 2008 skyrocketed by 120 percent and net profit of the company grows kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The company slogan IBM is: everything can change - not just the values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> Even so it is hoped that this flexible giant masters, the next crisis. </seg>
<seg id="357"> IBM&amp;#39;s history: From cheese cutter to Weltallflügen </seg>
<seg id="358"> The one hundred years ago in New York, founded company IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="359"> IBM took over the name until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The foundation for later company IBM put the merger of four companies, whose history in the 80s of the 19th Century back. </seg>
<seg id="361"> They owned technologies such as the famous clocks time cards for the registration of the work beginning and end. </seg>
<seg id="362"> The architect of this new company was Ranlett Charles Flint, who held until 1930, also chairs the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="363"> And it was Flint who hired the head of rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so this helped him in running the company. </seg>
<seg id="364"> The leader then put even the founder of IBM in the shadow - on Watson&amp;#39;s ideas are based to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Watson led the company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="366"> IBM began, as the name implies, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machinery for the trade - of sausages and cheese cutters, to cash. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he doubled its sales over nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually to all continents. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Watson was responsible for the company so indispensable that he whole forty years in the executive chair, sat until he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior replaced. </seg>
<seg id="369"> Under his leadership IBM began to develop artificial intelligence work, and also developed the first programming language. </seg>
<seg id="370"> In the 60 years of IBM computer technician and helped NASA to conduct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn in 1969 and also the famous flight of humans to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="371"> Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer in 1964 with the same family of computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series. </seg>
<seg id="372"> A classical computer, the computer determined the standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 to the market. </seg>
<seg id="373"> Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, however, she bought the part of consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers and grew the company hereby fully and completely into the business of consulting services and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="374"> The strategy that IBM is paying off in the last three years, the concept of &amp;quot;Smarter Planet&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="375"> It embodies the intention to use technology in an intelligent manner in less than previously planned areas, eg also to improve the situation in transport and urban management. </seg>
<seg id="376"> In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the platform &amp;quot;Smarter Commerce&amp;quot;, which is designed to help retailers to manage the entire commercial cycle. </seg>
<seg id="377"> IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="378"> As early as 1932, IBM has a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - as ever the first country in Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Today IBM operates CR including a strategic outsourcing center in Brno. </seg>
<seg id="380"> The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe based in Prague, and here there is also a top world-class research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Darina on her unfaithful husband Rychtářová: </seg>
<seg id="382"> Iveta - that ass you can keep you, I no longer want! </seg>
<seg id="383"> Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it&amp;#39;s over! </seg>
<seg id="384"> After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) from protectors of Iveta Bartosova (45) had become her lover, Darina was still hopeful that Joseph awoke from his dream of pink and comes home. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But now it&amp;#39;s finally over and with the patience for the other life, she has clear rules. </seg>
<seg id="386"> &amp;quot;Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner,&amp;quot; said D. Rychtářová. </seg>
<seg id="387"> As the singer Darina Rychtářová I. Bartosova had offered refuge in her own home, you probably would not even have dreamed of, like going out with her husband. </seg>
<seg id="388"> When Iveta moved back to her urging, after 30 days off and then back to Říčany, Joseph went along with it. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Yes, he even publicly known that he loves her. </seg>
<seg id="390"> Over time, resigned Darina, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now they finally gave him the marching orders. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Rychytář do not care who sleeps with his wife </seg>
<seg id="392"> When Iveta Bartosova Rychtář should leave it in the future, he will receive at home is not safe open arms. </seg>
<seg id="393"> &amp;quot;He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="394"> &amp;quot;Not as a beloved, old stray donkeys, but as a man to whom I have some ties&amp;quot;, said Ms Rychtářová, but she said that she had separated herself from him emotionally, and already there alone on mutual honesty. </seg>
<seg id="395"> The fact that he has locked the back door, Darina, Joseph wears yet with dignity. </seg>
<seg id="396"> &amp;quot;The decision I respect my wife.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="397"> &amp;quot;I stay involved with Iveta, it changes nothing.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="398"> &amp;quot;My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="399"> &amp;quot;The company continues to run, I&amp;#39;ll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="400"> &amp;quot;With Darina I talk normally, but we do not share the same bed,&amp;quot; said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk. </seg>
<seg id="401"> When Darina want to look for a new love, then he would not stop them. </seg>
<seg id="402"> &amp;quot;We do not sleep together, so I do not care whether she has a boyfriend or whoever that is. </seg>
<seg id="403"> I realize that this is my fault, I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love Iveta and therefore I assume all responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The worst female vices: How about you? </seg>
<seg id="405"> When the men were to prompt you to name a few typical female vices, then they shake off the cuff, without exception, some prompt. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Ladies, you recognize yourself in one of these lines again, where we have some bad habits can pass in review again, the men let the blood boil in his veins? </seg>
<seg id="407"> Shopping addiction </seg>
<seg id="408"> Accusing them of her husband, to be addicted to shopping? </seg>
<seg id="409"> Do you have to buy at least one rag week? </seg>
<seg id="410"> She likes to go shopping and it may also be a bit more in the same actions? </seg>
<seg id="411"> Then it goes in your case probably really a weakness. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Some women are, at least aware of their desire to buy and try to keep reasonably under control. </seg>
<seg id="413"> But honestly, what woman can not stand it already, looking for a well-fitting outerwear is the only way to walk through a clothing store and did not try all the same (in every possible color combinations) in the cabin? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Think they have some, how many times they have already told her husband - you&amp;#39;d better stay out there ... </seg>
<seg id="416"> Permanent discontent </seg>
<seg id="417"> &amp;quot;I am not too fat?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="418"> &amp;quot;I would have to remove at least five pounds - I start to jog or do aerobics?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="419"> &amp;quot;I gradient you at all?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="420"> Them that is somehow familiar? </seg>
<seg id="421"> Yes? </seg>
<seg id="422"> Then you are probably also among the women who are literally obsessed with how they look. </seg>
<seg id="423"> That is by no means that you should let go, but many men are allergic to it, if your wife complains constantly about her appearance. </seg>
<seg id="424"> The stronger sex is in agreement - with an increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always incompatible. </seg>
<seg id="425"> Order and cleanliness in the first place </seg>
<seg id="426"> It is a fight against windmills. </seg>

<seg id="440"> Women are now focused on time relationships, so they pant like those issues by, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why. </seg>
<seg id="441"> Probably every one of us women have a little harmless gossip in stock. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Be honest - that&amp;#39;s probably all women own. </seg>
<seg id="443"> This is not to be confused with gossips worst caliber, where nothing and no one is holy, who despise each well in their environment and especially for women&amp;#39;s collectives that represent a significant threat. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Voracek and Jagr helped Philadelphia with her assistant to victory </seg>
<seg id="445"> The ice hockey forward Jaromir Jagr had the Monday game in the NHL with two assistants large share of the 5-3 victory at Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL. </seg>
<seg id="446"> Beneficiaries of the survey of thirty-nine Hockey Stars in both cases was Claude Giroux, who have added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Two assistants also recorded in the same game Jagr&amp;#39;s teammate Jakub Voracek. </seg>
<seg id="448"> Jagr claimed to journalists after the match, he predicts a great evening Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="449"> &amp;quot;Even before the game I told him that he now manages a hat-trick.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="450"> I somehow had the feeling. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="451"> &amp;quot;Every now and then one comes upon such a feeling,&amp;quot; said Jagr, scored according to its action at the first shot Giroux of the Flyers a goal. </seg>
<seg id="452"> A bit later, also had the second hit, &amp;quot;a Czech track.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="453"> Voracek fought behind the gate of the Hurricanes the puck and put it before the successful between the circles Maxim Talbot. </seg>
<seg id="454"> One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players scored Patrick Dwyer, a short-hander, but the second was one-third again the Flyers. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Specifically Giroux. </seg>
<seg id="456"> In collaboration with Jagr he scored his third goal, after his shot deflected Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate. </seg>
<seg id="457"> &amp;quot;I love to play with him.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="458"> &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not saying that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly is one of the top three,&amp;quot; Jagr acknowledged its center. </seg>
<seg id="459"> &amp;quot;I would not have occurred in the life that I play to end my career with such a hockey player together, as with him.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="460"> &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m absolutely delighted.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="461"> &amp;quot;I cut my game to me.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="462"> &amp;quot;All these years in the NHL put my players their game on me and now the tables turn around,&amp;quot; Jagr smiled. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina did not match the drama - the hit of Tuoma Ruutua again and Dwyer, who prevailed in a penalty shot, it came up on a goal. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read prevented any further complication, however, in which he was successful in over number two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> &amp;quot;Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="466"> &amp;quot;He caught the puck, I picked up speed, and (Read) moved to distant posts.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="467"> &amp;quot;I tried to make and I am glad that it worked,&amp;quot; described Voracek the last goal of the game from his perspective. </seg>
<seg id="468"> With this victory, Philadelphia took the lead the Eastern Conference. </seg>
<seg id="469"> The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo, and retired in the second trimester because of an injury of the upper body. </seg>
<seg id="470"> The Candiens lost their next pool their experience and leadership in a penalty shoot-not lost 2:3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Could not convert any of the penalty shots Tomas Plekanec. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points were hurting the coach of the home team probably the high sickness absence on the defensive - the game they played with only five defenders to the end. </seg>
<seg id="473"> &amp;quot;This is bad.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="474"> &amp;quot;The meeting we played with only one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> &amp;quot;But there can do nothing, so we must be ready,&amp;quot; said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> &amp;quot;Every time you change an attacking wave after another and we had nothing to oppose.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="477"> &amp;quot;We could make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third need.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="478"> There were some reserves, &amp;quot;said PK Subban, a defensive player. </seg>
<seg id="479"> Ondrej Pavelec of the Czech goalkeeper fought off thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to a 5-2 victory over Winnipeg. </seg>
<seg id="480"> On the outskirts of the Jets, who had a series of five defeats hereby terminated, five different shooting percentage. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development in fares since 1989 </seg>
<seg id="482"> By 1989 there were only five of the then Czechoslovak government approved travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agencies selling trips at that time mainly only in the Socialist bloc countries, were allowed into the West at that time only a selected few. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And that Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - East Germany), in the Soviet Union (Sochi, on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and Hungary at Lake Balaton. </seg>
<seg id="485"> A possible exception was the period from 1962 and 1972, as one could also travel to Yugoslavia, then struck a pro-Western course and Yugoslavia were therefore severely restricted the travel of Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox that socialism, was that it was not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen of Czechoslovakia, for example, wanted to travel to Poland individually or even in the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called letter of invitation, individual trips were otherwise not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even back then the travel agent to also travel to the West, but then you had to take into account huge snakes or even in a sleeping bag to stay in front of the travel office, or at least &amp;quot;good friends&amp;quot; in the travel agency have. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Even so, the matter was far from gone. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so-called foreign exchange commitments - the requirement for an exit to the West - has been given only &amp;quot;politically reliable&amp;quot; people - the others were not traveling at all. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The Czechoslovak currency was freely convertible currency that is not without currency commitments so it would have been impossible for the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West to be found. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Czechs spent so far away most of their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs countless cottages and dachas bought - a practice that continues today. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the Czech revolution in the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> While all things were until 1989 a holiday in East Germany or Bulgaria in the measure, Czechs spent the last year, 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> An enormous paradox, which one is not aware of anymore is the fact that in the currently most popular tourist destination for Czechs - Croatia until 1989, could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> Right from the beginning of the 90s of last century, the motto of duty in the neighboring Western European countries have been lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria, especially to and from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Czechoslovaks were able to get from their long trips to the West just is not enough, everyone wanted at least a couple of days have been there. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Sun slept in the Czech tourists traveling to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would then have the money to stay in a hotel or a guesthouse had. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature of trips abroad by that time was a Czechs with canned goods, beer and sausage and so fully packed trunk. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was the introduction of freely convertible Czech crown - after decades of Western tourists were our currency finally free shopping. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries have risen, which in 1997 einmündete important in another moment. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Due to the increased demands for travel, travel agents began after 1997 to prepare regularly travel by charter flights, making the air travel with the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly reduced prices. </seg>
<seg id="503"> End of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devise means of payment with all other highly developed countries of the world, which made travel much easier. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of the &amp;quot;post-Velvet&amp;quot; tourist traffic there was in 2000 when it was released due to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Since then, annual direct charter aircraft to fly with Czech passengers to distant sunny countries and this year we will fly directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> There are about 100 thousand Czechs traveling to exotic countries every year! </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in the era that marked our &amp;quot;post-revolutionary&amp;quot; development came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the U.S. lifted its visa requirement for Czech tourists, bringing our country einreihte definitely among the advanced countries of the world. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their first holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent for a single holiday stay at the resort including the cost of more than 15 thousand CZK per head. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The AGM is to find a new chairman - again facing a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman, while threatening that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday will be known in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="512"> To date, there are in fact still no agreement on what should be elected by electoral rules. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And without absolutely no vote on the three potential successors is possible. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three potential buyers want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June joined Hasek back of his function, he urged his colleagues to the resignation had to come together and find a strong personality, which could lead to football in the future. </seg>
<seg id="516"> But - in the era after the old quarrels Hasek broke out again between the two chambers Association, who are unable to agree on a common candidate. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was demonstrated clearly on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Delegates at the Annual General Meeting had come for nothing in the National House in Prague&amp;#39;s Smichov district, because the negotiations led to no result, while it was not just about the election itself </seg>
<seg id="519"> One could in fact do not even agree on who in the full collection is actually eligible to vote - only the registered agent or the appointed officials with a power of attorney. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this single point is scored at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law contributed whose opinion a representation based on power of attorney is not permitted. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The disputes over the election rules, however, take to continue. </seg>
<seg id="522"> Also, the Executive Committee did not bring more clarity to the matter at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - basically anything else on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Although the views changed with respect to the choice a few times - the nerve center remained the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how will the 3rd Proceed round to avoid a stalemate? </seg>
<seg id="525"> &amp;quot;The issue concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model must be found,&amp;quot; said Dusan Svoboda, one of three vice-chairmen of the FAČR determine who represents management&amp;#39;s professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to a registered model wins in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he may run. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that whoever wins candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech side is again on the condition that the winner gets this percentage vote count at least a two thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id="529"> &amp;quot;Then the two preliminary rounds have absolutely no sense, this mode would make the entire two-chamber concept in question&amp;quot;, of course Svoboda the objections of the Moravian side that it would be best to not bend the electoral rules, but to choose according to the applicable statutes. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Which agrees surprisingly well Tomáš Paclík, even when looming, that the statutory election rules comes from all the candidates most likely to receive well-Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="531"> &amp;quot;My desire is that is chosen largely by the Statutes.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="532"> &amp;quot;This no nonsense replacement variants are invented, such as at the last meeting,&amp;quot; said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzen, candidate for the first time, and in his opinion, mainly against Pelta demarcated. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta but remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In his opinion, is the new chairman in Nymburk be known, and he believes the candidate will work constructively in the future. </seg>
<seg id="535"> &amp;quot;The possibility of qualifying for the national team for the World Championship at the present day would certainly help to calm the minds.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="536"> &amp;quot;If football rides on the first euphoric wave, then the greater willingness to cooperate,&amp;quot; said the official from Pribram, who brings all three of the most experienced and adept at both the professional as well as regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl there is more reserved. </seg>
<seg id="538"> &amp;quot;I hope to reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="539"> &amp;quot;This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the provisions for its own purposes&amp;quot; straighten out &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="540"> &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why a new block at the meeting is not excluded.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="541"> &amp;quot;But I hope that common sense prevails, ultimately,&amp;quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> But - a lot of time on agreement of all sides no longer remains. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the Fußballgeneralität will be up to the qualifier at all complete. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The charter aircraft should fly by, among other things Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice could start in the morning in Prague due to a technical fault did not and so was sought frantically for a replacement version, as one part of the Executive Committee still at the site of the Barrage -first leg to bring. </seg>
<seg id="545"> Ultimately, then surely the crucial meetings at ministerial level at which it is supposed to come on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobes, the Minister of Education, Youth and Sports would have divided the parties within the largest sports federation in the country like moving to an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is much at stake, namely: government grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football, and the forthcoming annual general meeting of the ČSTV that will have the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka new direction. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík goes into battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates </seg>
<seg id="549"> When Tomas Paclík, head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting would have a strong candidate to make that all his ideas would have met the new chairman of the Football Association of Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not at all on the battle for the top position admitted. </seg>
<seg id="550"> &amp;quot;If there is a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up the choice.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="551"> &amp;quot;But in the current situation, it failed to find such an adept,&amp;quot; said Paclík CTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for going Paclík, to duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, so it&amp;#39;s to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, reached the top of the FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also emphasizes that if he wins he does the role of the chairman to exercise only one year, ie until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of president he would have liked to see an experienced senior managers who ends up not too much into the football action is. </seg>
<seg id="555"> &amp;quot;With some eligible people I&amp;#39;ve spoken personally.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="556"> &amp;quot;Hard to believe, that give me some said they did not currently identify with the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="557"> &amp;quot;Such views would have gladly changed,&amp;quot; he cited. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most disturbing of all Paclík Pelta&amp;#39;s alleged connection with the chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Berbr novel, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates voting at general meetings. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta had held the position of chairman. </seg>
<seg id="560"> &amp;quot;With his victory would be the present condition and einkonserviert in Czech football, it would not advance at all.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="561"> &amp;quot;The support from Berbr a clever businessman, the football would get doubly bad,&amp;quot; said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> By this he alludes to the fact that Pelta&amp;#39;s name was some time ago in connection with phone taps to determine in a corruption scandal, but from the Pelta impunity emerged. </seg>
<seg id="563"> &amp;quot;I do not know what prestige would bring the victory of Pelta (Cz) football.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="564"> &amp;quot;And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&amp;quot; said řekl Paclík that his earlier statement, &amp;quot;he would sell the football club Pilsner, when will President Pelta,&amp;quot; but already looks more relaxed. </seg>
<seg id="565"> If Paclík win in Thursday&amp;#39;s election, but he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelta well. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just think also another candidate - Rajchl the Paclík before the AGM in October was supported, which ended in a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> &amp;quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to go would be to me.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="568"> &amp;quot;He has great skills.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="569"> &amp;quot;I could imagine him as well as head of the national team.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="570"> &amp;quot;But I do not think that he is able to lead the Association as a manager.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="571"> &amp;quot;I am my nose stuck but not in matters of which I know nothing,&amp;quot; said Paclík, who in September, provided that a sensation that he left behind the dismissal of the Referees Committee with Ludek Macela at the top was the Dagmar Damková replaced. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík himself claims that he feels up to the role of the association chairman. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And refers to his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also chief of Pilsen, which celebrated its support in May, the first triumph in the league. </seg>
<seg id="574"> &amp;quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain culture of this.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="575"> &amp;quot;To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, what to degenerate into vile situations,&amp;quot; led to Paclík who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, compared with the Sparta-chief Daniel Kretinsky. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of his priorities, he saw to the strengthening of relations between the Czech and FAČR Olympic Committee, with whose help he would be lobbying for political leaders to ensure that more money flows out of the lottery tax in the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> &amp;quot;This is one of the key things that should be devoted to the new president.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="578"> &amp;quot;When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as declaring the political parties, then I understand their argument, they must also say loud and clear where the money goes,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> His connection to the Club Pilsner Paclík also sees not as a handicap, although he himself stresses, the chairman of the FAČR must be &amp;quot;bipartisan&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta is in turn connected to Pribram, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> &amp;quot;This is not ideal.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="582"> &amp;quot;I think it makes sense but not much, my shares in the club transferred to Pilsner hypocritical to a third person in order to return a half years,&amp;quot; explained Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude a stalemate in the future. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates pledged to the president office, namely Miroslav Pelta, he&amp;#39;ll do in the event of his election to an extent that the FAČR gets new statutes that preclude future disputes over the election rules from the outset. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday&amp;#39;s hearing Nymburk and believes the campaign will be safely defuse a potential success of the Czech variety. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta had promised before the election in September is not realized that he wanted to focus on if elected to the national team and the recovery of funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided until the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and so he liked the two-month break to help to defend his ideas on the management of football and to present in a broader context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> &amp;quot;People at all levels devote himself to football, they are impatient and expect that the president is announced on Thursday.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="589"> &amp;quot;He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee. </seg>
<seg id="590"> That&amp;#39;s why he says that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech team. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that responsible for the current problems with the election euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> &amp;quot;Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed. </seg>
<seg id="593"> If they did not allow different interpretations, we have already had a chairman in September, &amp;quot;said Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Just a review of the most important document of the civil association he used as bait for the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> &amp;quot;I should be president, then I guess its me personally and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it does not work.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="596"> &amp;quot;This is a matter of principle, without which he can not,&amp;quot; says Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition, he is not trying to distance themselves against his opponent. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Earlier he had announced he would enter into a collaboration with Jindrich Rajchl imagine that he recognizes because of his legal training and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> Tomáš Paclík he took a long time to no more, which in turn was not a dry thread on Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In football, he moves more than a year and can already point to some successes. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="601"> &amp;quot;His attacks were, however, disparaging, and many people were shocked by his campaign.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="602"> &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why many now doubt of his real character,&amp;quot; Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to its Proklamierungen that he has already commented in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In his opinion, is his strongest weapon, the knowledge of football from the lower leagues, to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the flagship of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> &amp;quot;I would also seek to end all love affairs - the Cause of Bohemians, to the reverberations of the corruption scandal last year.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="606"> &amp;quot;Right after that I would throw myself on negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure adequate funding for all the football,&amp;quot; the forty-six candidates CTK said two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> At that time he also promised that his collection would mean to the tip of the Czech football no personnel purges. </seg>
<seg id="608"> &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d have to work first with the content of all employees become familiar,&amp;quot; he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the long anarchy understandably nervous. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the catastrophic scenarios dezeitigen that accompany the forthcoming annual general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday not go in vain to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="610"> &amp;quot;If really the only point at issue should be how to vote in the third round, then we get over it.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="611"> &amp;quot;Football needs credibility and the only way he wins back when he finally has a new leader,&amp;quot; Pelta is two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career with optimism. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the FAČR begins to work hard at it </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the former deputy chairman Jindrich Rajchl at the AGM on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, this would apparently many people spoil the mood in the dressing. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises, namely, that we start to work hard if elected. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for some soccer fields. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into football and otherwise to continue the work that has begun the previous chairman Ivan Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="617"> &amp;quot;As chairman I would like to devote myself to football as a whole.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="618"> Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national team, professional football, through to competitive soccer for the youth. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> &amp;quot;So I will not say that I want to do everything alone,&amp;quot; said in an interview for CTK Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="620"> &amp;quot;I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member of a certain area is devoted.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will distribute hard task, so the football is progressing in each segment with mileage increments. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="622"> It would be a lot not just delighted, because they, rather than to criticize the work of others, now work really hard to even begin would, &amp;quot;he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement was considered to no longer run. </seg>
<seg id="624"> &amp;quot;From my knowledge, I work 20 hours a day.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="625"> &amp;quot;But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, throwing me not constantly stick between his legs, and every step I take, calling into question,&amp;quot; he said as an explanation of why he was hesitant. </seg>
<seg id="626"> &amp;quot;Many people told me but that I should not give up, because it would do for other things also.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="627"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s trust that we must not lose,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Supposedly it also motivated to be able to continue the work he has begun to Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &amp;quot;In two years we have dealt with a great work and I do not want to throw away now.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="630"> &amp;quot;The processes have been started which will probably only in a few years into its own and I would not like to see that they stop someone,&amp;quot; he said, does hereby express its concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the days before Hasek. </seg>
<seg id="631"> &amp;quot;I believe in the systematic approach and is something that Mirek Pelta not cut it.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="632"> &amp;quot;Behind him, above all people that would make the football so that he would be there only for the elect.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="633"> I can probably blame Some, but not that I&amp;#39;m biased. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="634"> &amp;quot;I try to be objective.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="635"> &amp;quot;I want football for all, because then it all goes well and not just the chosen ones,&amp;quot; said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="636"> He also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="637"> &amp;quot;Although some people say otherwise, I really going to do what is best for Moravia.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="638"> &amp;quot;For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, then ascended the winners in each of the first division.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="639"> &amp;quot;Then could not it happen that now play only three Moravian clubs in the league, which is a problem particularly for the young players in Moravia,&amp;quot; says Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="640"> Because it has now also joined the chief of the Pilsen club Tomas Paclík the battle for the role of the chairman, dares not Rajchl to assess his chances that he will chosen. </seg>
<seg id="641"> &amp;quot;I have a strong support feel in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to vice chairman and now recognizes the need for clear successes are behind me,&amp;quot; led to Rajchl, which includes the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations for the lottery law as regards its success. </seg>
<seg id="642"> On the other hand, he is partly to blame, that the association does not take a single strand. </seg>
<seg id="643"> As he says of Pelta, &amp;quot;he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to a new trust,&amp;quot; he holds the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really have something to offer football. </seg>
<seg id="644"> &amp;quot;No one can question that he has done in just one year in Pilsen excellent job.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="645"> &amp;quot;Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that has taken Ivan Hasek and the staffing of the commissions he would obviously not change fundamentally.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="646"> He would certainly not want hinbiegen things in his favor, &amp;quot;says Rajchl over his rivals. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Europe&amp;#39;s most beautiful pools </seg>
<seg id="648"> Jump into the blue </seg>
<seg id="649"> By Julia Stanek </seg>
<seg id="650"> Paddling in UFO appearance, ceremonial pools in Budapest: When traveling through Europe can meet a big surprise - and relax after a city tour or a hike in the tired legs, bubble baths. </seg>
<seg id="651"> One book shows where wellness is in the water at its best. </seg>
<seg id="652"> When Iris Meder in the past year and a half went on research trip, one could not fail in their luggage: her swimsuit. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Ling lying back on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, marble cherubs they swam towards the edge of the pool waiting for her, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools. </seg>
<seg id="654"> Liked her a bath, she took it at once in her notebook on - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building. </seg>
<seg id="655"> More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her recently published book &amp;quot;Bathing&amp;quot; in front: public swimming pools in Munich, historic palaces, bathing in the Black Forest, &amp;quot;hard-core concrete structures&amp;quot; in the Taunus. </seg>
<seg id="656"> By 13 countries, she led her &amp;quot;journey to the extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe&amp;quot;: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia. </seg>
<seg id="657"> The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast. </seg>
<seg id="658"> With sports, they did not care much, says Medes - only the water that was different. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Just annoying that fans have come to terms with floating blue tiles and chlorine smell, and joggers can inhale the heady scent of pine forests, or listen to cheerful chirping of birds in the park. </seg>
<seg id="660"> &amp;quot;I was one day asked why swimming pools actually have to always be so ugly,&amp;quot; said Meder, who lives in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="661"> &amp;quot;So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="662"> Water surface architecture doubles </seg>
<seg id="663"> Splashing in the diving pool and sauna, essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are controlled, the Medes. </seg>
<seg id="664"> And when the builders have taken pains to swimming pools to be a true feast for the eyes: &amp;quot;Instead of a floor in a bathroom you have a water surface.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="665"> &amp;quot;It is both transparent and reflects the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="666"> Everything is doubled optical: high arched, colorful tiles, stepping stones. </seg>
<seg id="667"> The small-format picture book &amp;quot;Bathing&amp;quot; provides 190 pages of facts about the architecture and cultural history, historic oases - but most of all desire to make a leap into the blue. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Notable examples discovered the pool collector Meder for her research in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="669"> In addition to sumptuous spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an alpine karst cave (cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal spa, the pool with alkalihaltigem water are filled up in a bottle-shaped building houses (Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény). </seg>
<seg id="670"> Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While the Zurich roof bath all the city has in mind, you can look in the outdoor pool, a spa in St. Anton on the snowy Arlberg - and: In the steam room there is a window from which one can observe the activity on the ski slopes. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Perhaps the most extraordinary design pool awaits swimmers at length field: The Aqua Dome Ötztal just looks like a UFO landed in the Alps. </seg>
<seg id="672"> Three open-top trays are concentrated in winter, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Alhambra in the Black Forest </seg>
<seg id="674"> Not in every swimming pool collector of the Medes rose odor of chlorine into the nose. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Many spas smell of sulfur in the bath in the Hungarian Árpád Bekescsaba it stinks so strongly of oil, which is hard to believe, to be landed in a health spa. </seg>
<seg id="676"> The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen healing water that is almost black and its a mud stuck to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special kind of spa experience </seg>
<seg id="677"> Iris Meder was in a place in their search for great swimming holes, however, disappointed as they wanted to visit the open air and sun bath in the Czech Luhatschowitz, they found a cordoned terrain. </seg>
<seg id="678"> In 1902 by architect Dusan Jurkovic designed bathroom has now been closed. </seg>
<seg id="679"> As the Medes a look through the windows of the weathered red, white and yellow art nouveau building, threw it looked like overgrown weeds between the tiles. </seg>
<seg id="680"> Has countered the decline in contrast to a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad. </seg>
<seg id="681"> Three phases have already been through this bath, you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements derived from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra Hall in style, which was added in 1900. </seg>
<seg id="682"> Since 1995, the palace of careful modernization is the favorite resort of the thermal pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she is originally from the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="683"> &amp;quot;It is quite an accomplishment to meld so many different styles to such a great unit,&amp;quot; says Meder. </seg>
<seg id="684"> With such a palace of the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter. </seg>
<seg id="685"> Agricultural speculation </seg>
<seg id="686"> German bank can illuminate commodity business </seg>
<seg id="687"> By Christian Teevs </seg>
<seg id="688"> Is the German bank on their business in agricultural commodities? </seg>
<seg id="689"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the effects of speculation for the poor of the world. </seg>
<seg id="690"> In January, the CEO wants to draw the conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="692"> For the Germans, the matter is clear: in 84 percent of Germans, according to a study is not acceptable for banks to speculate in agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize. </seg>
<seg id="693"> Two thirds of respondents did require that off the German bank and other financial institutions from this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa opinion poll commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report, presented in mid-October the Food Watch. </seg>
<seg id="696"> In it, Harald Schumann, the author shows that the bets on global commodity exchanges to drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear the blame on global hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign is aimed specifically consumer protection against German Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally commodity bets were intended to protect dealers against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But now, most experts are agreed that the gambler is decoupled from supply and demand have - and make profits at the expense of the poor. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Unlike U.S. rival Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to look into the allegations and said that no business be it &amp;quot;well worth adding to the reputation of the German bank at risk.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is examining the allegations in the Food Watch report. </seg>
<seg id="702"> By the end of the year, the examination to be completed, then the results of the management board of Deutsche Bank will be presented - along with recommendation on how to handle it. </seg>
<seg id="703"> The end of January will notify the head of the bank then the action it takes. </seg>
<seg id="704"> In the end, could be a reduction of the raw materials business, or even the complete abandonment. </seg>
<seg id="705"> Ackerman is working on its image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch head Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: &amp;quot;The betting on rising prices of food shows very dramatically, as banks recklessly injure the common good today.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="707"> Ackerman is a top banking lobbyist now a special responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="708"> &amp;quot;The German bank has to remove all equipment from its portfolio, bets where money is used on food prices,&amp;quot; said Bode. </seg>
<seg id="709"> &amp;quot;Whether Mr. Ackermann to starving people, or to the reputation of Deutsche Bank does.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="710"> The insight comes from Ackermann at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO would like to make a few months before his departure from office a perfect picture. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday, the German bank announced that the CEO will not go exactly as planned to the board. </seg>
<seg id="712"> With a shift away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image. </seg>
<seg id="713"> And he needs to potential losses is hard to shave - so that eventually his successor would have to do. </seg>
<seg id="714"> Second Commodity Systems Everyone would terminate </seg>
<seg id="715"> Food Watch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up. </seg>
<seg id="716"> To date, more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign, the organization took part. </seg>
<seg id="717"> On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 people surveyed. </seg>
<seg id="718"> Just eleven percent regard it as legitimate for the German bank offers facilities which will be placed on food prices. </seg>
<seg id="719"> Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Every second person would announce the survey to all systems in which money flows into commodity speculation. </seg>
<seg id="720"> 43 percent would discourage friends from such a bank, 49 percent said they think about it, to terminate your account and go to another institution. </seg>
<seg id="721"> 21er Haus, Vienna </seg>
<seg id="722"> The relocated pavilion </seg>
<seg id="723"> Ingeborg Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> An architectural history of ups, downs and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion of Expo Brussels in 1958 was won prizes in Vienna to the museum, stood empty and degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Now he is re-opened as an exhibition venue. </seg>
<seg id="726"> When swarmed by modern post-war architecture is of clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwarzer for the Brussels World Fair 1958, a striking and famous example . </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzer pavilion was then the Grand Prix d&amp;#39;Architecture for his light and floating-looking steel and glass construction. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The building is still regarded as a landmark of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He was the architect so well known that the built up at the next World&amp;#39;s Fair Pavilion in Austria. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW four-cylinder engine house plus outbuilding schüsselartigem in Munich in 1973 he finally internationally famous. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His planned as a temporary exhibition building pavilion was erected on one of the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden in Vienna South Station, and in 1962 converted to a museum of the 20th Century opened - the &amp;quot;20&amp;#39;s House&amp;quot; it was called. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Suitable, the building was neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called &amp;quot;21&amp;#39;s House&amp;quot; and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Tuesday night opened the Belvedere museum, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Enforced new beginning Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director in 2007, the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein-Arco, Ph.D., art historian with a remarkable career including in youth as Eiskunstläufererin later at Sotheby&amp;#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, rebuilding began strongly by politicians and preservationists, they procured public funding and private sponsorship and set usage. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba foundation of the same are issued, a café and a bookshop there should be, and an office building had to be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the implementation Krischanitz then was the ideal candidate. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because he had converted Joseph Olbrich&amp;#39;s Secession in Vienna and sensitively extended and won the competition, but because he has studied at the Technical University of Vienna Schwanzer and the pavilion for him a &amp;quot;tremendously important place&amp;quot; was where he &amp;quot; almost every weekend, &amp;quot;the exhibition was viewed. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost when they move to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness. </seg>
<seg id="744"> With the current renovation it was much bigger problems: the building was &amp;quot;a centrifugal energy,&amp;quot; says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The profiles of the window glass facade were replaced, used fiberglass reinforced insulation, replacing the glass roof by special safety glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Cold steel girder bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been restored. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two basements took place for the new use, a sunken trench between the house and street lighting provides the illumination, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original exterior doors are still there, the house is in old red-brown rust-color painted. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the cinema is even exactly the way it was before. </seg>
<seg id="750"> And all under the strict supervision of the heritage authority and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> &amp;quot;Often, a material had to be found, which is good and is cheap and well liked by the Archaeological Service,&amp;quot; says Krischanitz and indicates a rough floor in the basement. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and easy. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Difficult it was to the Pavilion, &amp;quot;was coming along from Brussels,&amp;quot; has Krischanitz said recently that a typical &amp;quot;drop-in-the-city story.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="754"> Such an architecture was &amp;quot;always in the wrong place&amp;quot; and would still &amp;quot;give a true consciousness.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, the 21er house is not in the wrong place, because it has occurred, an urban design opportunity: To the Swiss garden precisely formed around the newly proposed &amp;quot;Station Quarter&amp;quot;, with office and residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck will probably occur even more: The 21&amp;#39;s house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz-building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin Temporary bought art gallery, and we hear they been negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location the Swiss Garden. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Railway plans to winter-crisis package worth millions </seg>

<seg id="767"> Last winter, the train passenger had serious problems, since it lacks, among other things in difficult weather conditions on reserves. </seg>
<seg id="768"> Significant new regional trains have been waiting for years for an approval from the Federal Railway Authority. </seg>
<seg id="769"> In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The track is very difficult for even for years that they consider axles of ICE trains more often in the workshop can be after an ICE had at Cologne Main Station a broken axle. </seg>

<seg id="777"> &amp;quot;We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue, without the parties had to go to court,&amp;quot; a German bank spokesman said in New York. </seg>
<seg id="778"> The bank admitted no fault with the comparison. </seg>
<seg id="779"> This is also true for Citigroup, which has committed itself to pay 20.5 million dollars. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the cooperation of the two financial houses. </seg>
<seg id="781"> The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions, and a jump in bankruptcies in order to protect customer deposits. </seg>

<seg id="818"> His almost unfailing sense of making money he has been nicknamed the &amp;quot;Oracle of Omaha&amp;quot; is introduced. </seg>
<seg id="819"> After the announcement of Buffett investment, IBM shares rose by one percent premarket. </seg>
<seg id="820"> &amp;quot;Big Blue&amp;quot;, as IBM is known, is in the stock market a total of more than 220 billion dollars and is connected with Apple, and Microsoft&amp;#39;s most valuable technology company in the world. </seg>
<seg id="821"> At Microsoft, they said Buffett, but he would not enter. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Founder Bill Gates is a close friend. </seg>
<seg id="823"> The threat is palpable </seg>
<seg id="824"> After the discovery of the &amp;quot;Zwickau cell&amp;quot; Turkish media questioned the German law. </seg>
<seg id="825"> One newspaper even talks about a &amp;quot;bloody ideology,&amp;quot; the auflebe again. </seg>
<seg id="826"> The murders of eight Turkish descent and a Greek small business in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background. </seg>
<seg id="827"> This message is a response in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and worry. </seg>
<seg id="828"> For many German-Turks is returning a long-totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Moelln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable right-wing extremist violence with more background against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="829"> That in Germany there was xenophobia, but never in question. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The uncovered right-wing network, however, discloses dimensions whose dimension is far from sight. </seg>
<seg id="831"> &amp;quot;Is the bloody ideology again?&amp;quot; headline in the online edition of Turkish newspaper &amp;quot;Haberturk&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="832"> The newspaper &amp;quot;Sabah&amp;quot;, however, stressed that one of the perpetrators should have been an undercover agent of the secret service, and is concerned that German authorities could be involved in the right-wing swamp. </seg>
<seg id="833"> Prudent response, the Turkish Community in Germany: they remembered at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence. </seg>
<seg id="834"> Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought, together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens. </seg>
<seg id="835"> In bright colors, the interaction had been staged - as a history of success. </seg>
<seg id="836"> Seems like a slap in the face because the reporting of some Turkish media: &amp;quot;Germany&amp;#39;s gift to the Fiftieth&amp;quot; is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform &amp;quot;Haber X&amp;quot;, the lecture series, the background to the murder. </seg>
<seg id="837"> Germany and the issue of &amp;quot;Hurriyet&amp;quot; can not take it, to draw such association. </seg>
<seg id="838"> &amp;quot;It starts to stink,&amp;quot; is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="839"> He emphasized the fact that people had been murdered, and paid the taxes paid by their work makes an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had. </seg>
<seg id="840"> Extremely critical in Turkish-German Internet forums, the actions of the police and their investigation discussed later success. </seg>
<seg id="841"> Why is the German authorities had not already occurred much more likely to be sought in extreme right-wing circles for suspects, surprised the authors. </seg>
<seg id="842"> Some people show themselves to be at least rhetorically drastic means available, &amp;quot;Will this still sloppy, it remains the migrants have no other than self-defense and weapons.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="843"> &amp;quot;Probably the best self-protection will be.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="844"> &amp;quot;From the quality of information and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network very much depends on the internal peace in Germany,&amp;quot; writes &amp;quot;selenium&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="845"> What does it mean when is the inner peace in Germany in danger of attacks illustrated the Mölln and Solingen in the nineties. </seg>
<seg id="846"> The photo of the burned-out shell of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memories. </seg>
<seg id="847"> For no other event of the Turks living here showed clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that distrust and distance in the right lead to violence. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of identity on the Turkish side. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The mistakes of the past does not repeat </seg>
<seg id="850"> The Turkish press was criticized at the time, especially the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Molln. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish President, was on the memorial ceremony in Cologne, however, represented by its Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was one time in his speech, like many Turks, the local taxes contributed. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As if, to calculate the value of a human being according to the amount of his taxes. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep is the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law ever since. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re-evaluation of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, it takes time frank words. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The bank scandal of Lake Zurich </seg>
<seg id="856"> The most adventurous bank in Europe is not sitting in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> UBS was nearly bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slithers from one crisis to another. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it is directed by a German. </seg>
<seg id="859"> So it was not thought safe, Axel Weber. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank had become known in July that he would take up nearly as 2013, a spectacular new job: Chairman of the Swiss banking giant UBS - An unexpected and lucrative career move. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was looking forward publicly praised her beauty to Switzerland and UBS whether their new-found solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> &amp;quot;UBS has managed the turnaround.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="863"> &amp;quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger, Oswald Grübel.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="864"> But in September it became clear that everything would turn out quite differently. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader at UBS in London, had bypassed all the security systems of the bank and gambled around 1.7 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="866"> UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, a place famous not only bankers in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The chairman of UBS has since become a well struck - and everyone asks: When will come Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> It was already known that Weber must advise the Bank from February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the Chairman of the Board, he is already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="870"> Axel Weber is hard. </seg>
<seg id="871"> He is not a banker, but economics professor and central bankers, and had a training period had certainly needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At a stroke he takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that she has already earned the title of &amp;quot;biggest bank scandal of Europe.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because UBS is a huge part - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and slides on the other hand for years of a scandal to the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, remains of the once-proud Swiss bank saves. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It started in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the silent and sound, but also savvy Swiss wealth manager they had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in investment banking is a very large number. </seg>
<seg id="878"> Sun managed by UBS in 2007 on the one hand with $ 1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> On the other hand, it was advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="880"> That makes an impression. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and later years of banking in Zurich Professor Hans Geiger says: &amp;quot;I have my students at that time, UBS still held up as model of a good bank.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="882"> &amp;quot;In retrospect, one wonders: How could I be wrong just like that?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, apparently for the first time that something went wrong in belonging to UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> Middle of the year was chief executive Peter Wuffli back surprisingly, regarded until then as well as a highly intellectual and brilliant bankers. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later they guessed why he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Investment Division of the Bank had gambled with subprime securities and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="888"> To the shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> But they did find investors, but what about the many to have turned up shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secret that not even heard his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But that was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, it was worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The new bank had to announce billions in losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 or the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008 came the catastrophe be the UBS was considering its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the government. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank purchased from UBS for billions problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation were six billion francs for a mandatory convertible, which they could be co-owner of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she realized how dramatic it is for a small country, if it home to such large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> Finally, the total assets of UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> &amp;quot;Once again we could not save the UBS,&amp;quot; says Bank researchers violinist. </seg>
<seg id="898"> At the first disaster was followed to the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later capitulated in the UBS tax dispute with the United States and agreed to publish the data of wealthy clients, who had probably evaded taxes with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="900"> They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including criminal charge. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Thus, UBS, more or less openly confessed to have helped with tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time she lost something that had always been their capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal was not the same Swiss banking secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It was followed by the resignation of CEO and chairman. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of client funds. </seg>
<seg id="906"> Thus, the bank had lost its credibility within a few months in both the central business areas: investment banking through the incorrect speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when it was a bit quiet again, just when you thought, now that UBS would have done it again, there follows this unfortunate story Dealer: An individual trader gambled 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it is evident: The risk management in investment banking, you&amp;#39;re still not clear. </seg>
<seg id="909"> &amp;quot;The case has Adoboli you have to realize that the risk control has changed little,&amp;quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich bank. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Also, the CFO of a major German bank is confident: &amp;quot;The problem with that UBS&amp;#39;s risk control is not under control.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="911"> It was exactly the idea of ​​caution was that the Swiss bankers were begun long ago, keeper of the great fortunes of the world are to: not too much risk, but security for the money - might also be beyond the Alpine republic once to collapse the world . </seg>
<seg id="912"> The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for very fine chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The headquarters of UBS in Zurich, still fits the stereotype of the dignified Swiss private bank - it&amp;#39;s just a bit larger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The location alone is classic. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The Bank is headquartered at the Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to the main station of Zurich, which is framed by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewelers like Tiffany&amp;#39;s can be found here between the traditional Swiss shops like Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> Reside here for centuries, the Swiss banks: National Bank of the Palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Baer. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside are marble-clad walls, standing in front of thick leather chair, next to the bank logo a large sign for &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="921"> UBS knows what the client looks here: security. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of ​​the Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank is. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two commercial banks. </seg>
<seg id="924"> UBS has become too large, it is - especially in investment banking, which had also spread the Anglo-Saxons. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss would have to say there&amp;#39;s nothing more. </seg>
<seg id="926"> &amp;quot;And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="927"> In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS changed, gave her first big profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost in the subprime jungle as much money as the Swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008, the visible disaster. </seg>
<seg id="929"> &amp;quot;That Wednesday, the government decided Coalition of the small country&amp;#39;s seven million, the biggest bailout in the history of their nation,&amp;quot; the author writes Luke Hässig in his book &amp;quot;The UBS-Crash&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros granted to politicians in order to save the bank from bankruptcy standing. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> When speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, included two of the three major Swiss banks together into a huge corporation. </seg>
<seg id="934"> There was a bank that was already in the merger too big for the little Switzerland - and ever growing. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that the two different precursor banks UBS completed: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers were favorable to a lot of money with which they could turn a giant wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are associated with this rise of UBS&amp;#39;s Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 CEO of UBS, Marcel Ospel, and, then Chairman of the Board. </seg>
<seg id="938"> &amp;quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team,&amp;quot; says Bank researchers Hans Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &amp;quot;Wuffli, the high intellectuals, Modest, who knows a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked up by the bank clerk to the top.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel had to leave at the end of Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And at the end Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake: &amp;quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&amp;quot; says Geiger. </seg>
<seg id="942"> &amp;quot;This is a tragic case.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear that arrogance came before a fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Employees of UBS remember much of the leadership meetings where CEO Wuffli spent repeating the same slogan: Goldman Sachs, on this day. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She led the &amp;quot;league tables&amp;quot; that rank lists, the success of the banks at that time documented. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then did the UBS to the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some steps had already succeeded her. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the foreign exchange and equity trading business, she appeared at the top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Consultants who were commissioned lifted, however, shows a weakness in the international business interest in the language of bankers &amp;quot;fixed income&amp;quot;, there is a huge gap to the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> UBS has gaps in American mortgage products. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that nearly cost them their existence. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth investing, both the bank acts as a hedge fund founded in front of her in American sub-prime assets. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It developed into a powerful machine, the securities of American mortgages packaged and passed it - but it also kept itself risks. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Even more than other banks long since sought the exit. </seg>
<seg id="957"> &amp;quot;In the summer of 2007 when the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS has bought there,&amp;quot; said banking expert violinist. </seg>
<seg id="958"> As great as the euphoria, so deep is the case. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager had to go after the other, as the clean up efforts ausfielen difficult than expected. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Positions at UBS were the ejection seat and are still shaky. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who Leads the bank has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> He must find a strategy for a bank of any adjacent business models have been lost. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bank researchers Geiger has already an idea: Stop the investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the roots in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Quite as much the bank will not (yet) do not. </seg>
<seg id="965"> But investment banking is expected to shrink strongly, so much is already clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Next Thursday will the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world to present its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was meant only as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprisingly Grübel from previous split. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Meanwhile, he has prevailed: he will always lead the operations of UBS, said the Zurich-based bank said on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti will return the investment bank to the state in the mid nineties. </seg>
<seg id="970"> 3,500 jobs, he emphasizes. </seg>
<seg id="971"> It is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is she? </seg>
<seg id="974"> What they want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber is now safe. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly, he says so far only, he would find his wife only once a flat in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>

<seg id="994"> Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness in the banks. </seg>
<seg id="995"> The investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this only caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Therefore, it was his opinion too early to invest in European government bonds and banks. </seg>

<seg id="1014"> The one they like, they want to get rid of the other very quickly: crows belong to the city for centuries, but many local residents&amp;#39; complaints are piling on the dirt and noise of the animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> It is an antidote to the &amp;quot;problem birds&amp;quot; not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Rooks were received from the cities to not get out, experts said at the first symposium in the East Frisian idle crows. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> There, experts from all over Germany advised on possible ways out. </seg>

<seg id="1032"> &amp;quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws&amp;quot; advertised, however, the psychologist and anthropologist Mary Uta Juergens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: &amp;quot;a pimple on the face, we can finally bear most confident.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Jurgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the Aschenberger Crow Trail co-founded information on the signs of the life of the highly intelligent rooks. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> The project will now been taken by tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Even the criticism of the noise of the birds Jurgens had their own opinion: &amp;quot;Because a lot of communication that have much to say to each other.&amp;quot; </seg>

<seg id="1278"> If you come at all? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly anyone knows what happened or why this war is ever done. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> &amp;quot;Lack of facts,&amp;quot; said Englund notes, &amp;quot;were pepped with assumptions, beliefs, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1281"> &amp;quot;Beauty and Terror&amp;quot; follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories were mostly memories, letters and other measures already taken from published materials. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Their life stories can be scary or poignant, but they are very much alive in the smaller details Englund losing collection of moments. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them deal with shortages and remedies yourself. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the story of a German girl&amp;#39;s school, he says, &amp;quot;Spare, spare everywhere.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1286"> &amp;quot;Ersatz coffee, aluminum false, incorrect, erasers, paper boards, wooden buttons.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He tells more of the replacement of Essen in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes &amp;quot;meat (and was recently served with a false bone in wood) made of pressed rice and fried in mutton fat was tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes were soled with wood.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There were, as he notes, &amp;quot;837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories deal with honor and valor. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and tells about the war: &amp;quot;We feel that this is after all what was likely intended for men than in the easy chair to sit in with the evening paper or the seller and a cigarette and a whiskey hand, and to pretend that meant such a facade of civilization and barbarism, as if there were not behind their starched and studded shirt-front. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he would probably die and no one take any notice or care. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &amp;quot;When the idea of ​​sacrificing themselves, refrains, one might think that this is done before an audience,&amp;quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead, it is as terrible as &amp;quot;a convicted man who was hanged in secret.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart, and new types of terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> &amp;quot;The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition,&amp;quot; writes Englund, &amp;quot;a war between the factories.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1297"> He captures the arrival of what he calls &amp;quot;a new species in the bestiary of the still young century&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;the word clever and convincing ideological mass murderer in the tailored suit, the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave in unexpected ways and there are just as frivolous behavior as heroism. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Englund discusses the soldiers who were trying actively to infect himself with a prostitute with a venereal disease, to escape the front lines. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> &amp;quot;The grotesque expression which can be found in trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come into hospital,&amp;quot; he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> &amp;quot;Those who were really desperate to rub it in their eyes, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves Englund&amp;#39;s poetry supple and yet unobtrusive and fits perfectly to his superhuman task. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> In dozens of short scenes he captures the way the war as &amp;quot;uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> People begin to wonder why they bring their leaders to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> The best books about the First World War were usually rather distorted as Paul Fussells &amp;quot;Great War and Modern Memory,&amp;quot; and novels such as Erich Maria Remarque&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Western Front&amp;quot; as a comprehensive history. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Englund&amp;#39;s band performs at an unconventional Hall of Fame. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> His book has the most devastating end that I have ever read in a fiction book. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> I give her no more. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> But it is as if he had snapped his book with us this side of the main characters in his face and lit with a match. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them were wearing helmets use. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> They had decided on the night of Monday to Tuesday, because at that time few people in the park are Zucotti. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All other initially believed to participate in an exercise. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in their midst and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> The events of recent weeks as the onset of pepper spray against protesters, which is against the rules of the Department and the squatters a huge increase in public sympathies were procured, not repeat itself. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training was conducted. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Officials had prepared for this by observing how appointments were handled in other cities. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> A disaster drill was held with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Iceland. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> Officials increased the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid installation of a large number of police officers is one - to focus on Lower Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> The last training session was held Monday night at the Manhattan side of the East River. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The command to move into the park, came &amp;quot;at the last minute,&amp;quot; said someone who is familiar with the command, which spoke for a declaration as a &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> &amp;quot;The few policemen who were involved as I know did not know that it came to Zuccotti Park,&amp;quot; said someone who wishes to remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> &amp;quot;The only ones who knew that it went to the Zuccotti Park, were the senior officials of the department.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1324"> One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that was learned the city. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> On 14 Officials wanted to vacate the park in October, but gave way back then, when hundreds of protesters gathered after they had learned of these plans. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> Officials from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile civil servant, which are normally used in high-crime neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in the park come and go, almost as commuters, so that 1 clock at night is a good time to go inside. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> &amp;quot;It was appropriate to do so when the least number of people staying in the park,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> Ambulances with klieg lights and speakers stood in front of the exit at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge ready. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> The lamps and pre-recorded messages that boomed from the speakers, many seemed to intimidate protesters. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> Invaded than the public officials in their light blue jackets in the park, many protesters simply snatched up her things and left the place. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> The police said that would be touched to 1:45 clock no tents for the protesters to allow time to pack their belongings together. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Other teams of officers were seen as they gathered in the area to intervene should be necessary arrests in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Reporters were forced to leave the park. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this was done for their own safety. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> But many journalists argue that they wanted to prevent them from observing the police actions in the park. And they said, the use of officials had been very rough. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> Mr. Browne said that TV stands in Church Street on the west side of the park were able to make photos. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> When the police in the west by the great jumble of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, moving, followed by its employees of the sanitation department who lifted what was left. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> Some protesters who refused to go, were dragged out. Images from this appeared a short time later on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> One of the main core of protesters drew near the kitchen area of ​​the camp in the center of the park position. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp is bound together by their arms. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> Civil defense officials were called to cut loose around her. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> As Mr. Kelly said, until about 3:30 clock no arrests were carried out in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The evacuation was completed, according to the police after 75 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Among the most arrests occurred, he said, because of &amp;quot;disorderly conduct and resisting an arrest.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The most prominent local officials, Joseph J. Esposito was the head of the department&amp;#39;s highest uniformed officer of the department. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also there. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Despite his presence, &amp;quot;directed&amp;quot; Mr. Kelly &amp;quot;the operation is not&amp;quot; as Mr. Browne said. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> In the event that they should access, a second group of officers waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> The Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park road, and at Pine Street, one block south, barricades were erected. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> It could be observed from these locations as the police within the expanding itself to the Zuccotti Park around. </seg>
<seg id="1355"> In one place was seen as more officials, many of them with shields, drove people out. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Approximately 28 people were in the northern area. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> Clock ran south around 5 Pine Street one protester on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air in the tire of a police bus. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> In a place threw the crowd a piece of plywood. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the end came an officer and a protester to the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> Managers of the union will file a lawsuit against the city because of layoffs </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Have the union, the hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, represents plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as layoffs teach because of their disproportionate influence in the schools, poor students, and do not necessarily discriminatory. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The action is probably the last opportunity for the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make the layoffs reversed is still open. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the lowest paid employee of the city and on the 7th October had lost in a move by their work, the union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city access to a health fund, which amused the workgroup, had denied to the budgetary gap should be closed. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools in the last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that we have adopted in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the City Council fired back, telling him that nothing in the Budget Just specify that employees of the school aid would be released. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials of the City Council 37 said they had warned the Ministry of Education and before an action. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the suit in the Supreme Court will be announced formally in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The suit will perform Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as a defendant and eight laid-off workers are counted as plaintiff, all of which are colored or Hispanic women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department of the city, said the city would not be before the lawsuit and therefore could not be commented on their individual claims. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a lawsuit design, the New York Times exists, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the slums of the city to support a claim for discrimination. She claims that poor schools have lost more workers since they are chronically underfunded. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> She argues that while there were no layoffs on Staten Iceland and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, have lost 17 school volunteers in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 volunteers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> By noting the loss of five out of eight school volunteers who in the public schools and 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were hired, says the lawsuit: &amp;quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents, the donations can organize to absorb budget cuts. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P.S.: The budget of the 36th District has been reduced this year by 3.26 percent. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for the extra funding for each charity school enrollment. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union complains also that the head of the high schools by the language in the memo have been misled, which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo used the English word &amp;quot;excess&amp;quot; to describe the action, even if the &amp;quot;excess&amp;quot; (German: on set) in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers from the Central Office be paid. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> &amp;quot;Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred,&amp;quot; says the suit design. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission accomplished, Congress ready to communicate regarding Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> It looks like finally, as Republicans and Democrats in Washington had already come to an agreement regarding the riots in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All that was needed was for this purpose, the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi and the end of American intervention. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday, the committee decides on International Relations of the Senate a resolution that the Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is subject to, and Libya to the successful rebellion and the U.S. American troops for their &amp;quot;courage&amp;quot; praises. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> &amp;quot;This resolution honors the brave people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country,&amp;quot; said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> &amp;quot;It is an affirmation of support for their democratic efforts by two parties.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer, arguing lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in Libya Mission to NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, the Kerry and McCain in front of a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The bill was rejected in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties and there was no vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But this law was on the same day by the Senate. In addition, the board overruled a decision to cut the funding for U.S. operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Thus, the U.S. mission fell into a sort of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was applied but enough to criticize Obama&amp;#39;s approach in the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him to the ground under their feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then the indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in August, was among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi on 20 October killed. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate is perhaps ready to act. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee on International Relations &amp;quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;praising the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partner, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also reaffirms &amp;quot;the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy Libya&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Will the new measures to ensure full support of the Foreign Relations committee received or will they split the legislature, as did the Law of June? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version is opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugar spokesman said on Monday that he now the final version of the new law have not yet seen. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> According to the Capitol, it&amp;#39;s the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every legislative term of the Republican Congress and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area, which is the time to vote in the Senate or Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to get her to change to a vote, although they have tried often enough. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Good lattes change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that were submitted to Congress and include a range of topics. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are double - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate presented - others differ only slightly from each other. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> It is only in the Senate at least 15 versions of the balance budget amendment and a dozen more, the &amp;quot;control federal spending&amp;quot; would. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among the Republicans who want to polish up her resume - the opportunity to brag that they are &amp;quot;written&amp;quot; such a measure have. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Budget Enforcement Act, passed in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget balance. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators for a non-binding resolution voted to support the idea of ​​such a change. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> About the budget, some members are getting at the number of terms present, the members of Congress can limit, while the Republicans pick José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage is, as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states reject this. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So eager, like the members to propose amendments, as they move much faster in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> The 111th Congress submitted 77 such legislative changes. the 110th 66th Congress </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The speed pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which more than 150 regular members suggested changes every two years, the numbers, the Senate library. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they were not much more successful than they are today. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last change is to add the - the 27th - Was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> &amp;quot;Got him, but not defeated,&amp;quot; said Gifford&amp;#39;s first television interview after the assassination </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after a gunman had shot at close range during an election rally in Tucson on she joined the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) on Monday night on national television. She sang alone for Broadway play &amp;quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&amp;quot; and said the desire to recover, to be greater than the return to the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> When she along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News &amp;quot;20/20&amp;quot; occurred, she struggled for words and needed help walking. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The broadcast showed the slow recovery from the severe damage that shared the ball, their skulls pierced the left side of her brain and crosses her head from front to back, has had done. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she returned unexpectedly returned to Congress and triumphantly cast their vote on the debt brake. </seg>

<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked her how she felt, said Gifford (41): &amp;quot;Very well.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour &amp;quot;20/20&amp;quot; specials, which was shortly before the release of the new book of the couple recorded: &amp;quot;Gabby: A story about courage and hope.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The Special pursued Giffords recovery since the assassination of 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you see them in the hospital bed, with shaven head and a long scarf over his forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> You can only lift a finger or two, when her husband encouraged her. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists to show her how to perform simple movements. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A twitch of the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, her first words: &amp;quot;What.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After a few days Giffords whispers a word &amp;quot;toast&amp;quot;. She wants her breakfast is changed. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> Videos that are played on the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords&amp;#39; recovery: You can see how the Congressmen together with the therapist to Cyndi Lauper&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&amp;quot; and Tom Petty&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Free Fallin &amp;#39;&amp;quot;sings. </seg>

<seg id="1439"> During the recovery of his wife, so Kelly told Sawyer she said: &amp;quot;I was hit.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1440"> &amp;quot;So, I would say:&amp;quot; Gabby, you were not defeated, said Kelly, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You were just made. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you&amp;#39;ll get through this and you will relax you and you will come back stronger than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops feel pity rather than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> On cue, gathered hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The amount in black tuxedos stood and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> &amp;quot;The servicemen and women were seen as heroes,&amp;quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer at the gala, which was observed among others by the Chief of Staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of different forces. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> &amp;quot;They were introduced as orphans,&amp;quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I&amp;#39;m sure the organizers have been kind. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But there was no respect, not really. It was pity. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops will be showered with praise for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has its price, say service members. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is increasingly behaving as if their men in uniform would do harm. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> &amp;quot;We were not victims,&amp;quot; ​​said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, commander of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon go. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> &amp;quot;But apparently, the only way the support is the one to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who are not ungrateful or in conflict with the public, who want to serve them appear. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They have also realized that the anger, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was met, was far worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result of conversations taking place about compassion in private between breastfeeding and war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons have returned from battles with the Marines warned the retired colonel Mark Cancian, they warned that people could see their world outside the military service from two different perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some would consider it with a sense of awe, as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others would wonder if there is a &amp;quot;raging, violent veteran under the surface&amp;quot; conceals said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over after his return, a senior government positions in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly inquired if he was able to withstand the same after returning from combat the pressures of a demanding post in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> &amp;quot;When you talk about your ministry, you have to contrast the negative impressions hold,&amp;quot; said Cancian his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in the lack of American interest in the war. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Performance on the battlefield are from a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely singled out as praise. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> &amp;quot;We appreciate as a nation no longer military heroism as it was very common during World War II,&amp;quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, focus the praise of politicians and the public largely to the plight of a service member. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them or for the severity of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> Military faces up to growing pressure to crack down on rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention in a rape before a military court. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> If it does not happen, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Lance Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th Weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleagues at night. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from dinner with a friend back when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer with him. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked if he could accompany them for a drink in her room. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> &amp;quot;My alarm bells went on,&amp;quot; said Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texan brushed aside their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought, &amp;quot;Oh, he is 19 </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas, &amp;quot;she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> &amp;quot;I wish I had on my gut feeling is.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after they had left on Lyman&amp;#39;s room, the man walked up behind her, pressed her down and raped her, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November wait Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided in the will, whether an action they have against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld charged , is admissible in court. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld are not taken against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC filed the lawsuit initially covered 17 applicants, which increased but in the following months to 28 months: 25 women and three men who claim all that they were raped by soldiers, colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to investigate, or condemn adequately provide law after the alleged attack is available., </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says they follow the top military leadership, as the problem begins there. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> &amp;quot;The military is hierarchical,&amp;quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> &amp;quot;Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retribution? The leadership.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that she has contacted since February, nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs say lay their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit as many other actions to maintain the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride has made an application to dismiss. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The records of the court that there Newsweek keep a detailed on the defense strategy in the first place, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers for violations, which have occurred in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Because of a law of the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are in active service soldiers inflicted. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> &amp;quot;The alleged damage incurred during military service of the plaintiff,&amp;quot; says the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this story. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, so the distinction is only in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both in Iraq and Afghanistan teams play increasingly important roles of soldiers, particularly in make contact with local women in war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them in combat. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time that the military is modernized, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And it is in their struggle not alone: ​​three additional cases are pending in addition to their. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School prepares the Veterans&amp;#39; Legal Services Clinic, a lawsuit against the four major military academies because of alleged support of a misogynistic atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Regardless of this collects the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America, a lawsuit against the military, is based upon the diagnosis of &amp;quot;personality disorder&amp;quot; concentrated, received rape victim, in order to remove from office - a common practice, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of Service Women&amp;#39;s Action Network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Your group filed suit in December against the Veterans Administration (engl.: the Veterans Administration) a, in which she accused her discriminatory practices in their handling of benefit claims for people who reported having been sexually abused in the service. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws were independently submitted by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, the Congress, provide a set of clues. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> (: Office for preventing and reporting sexual abuse dt) of the Department of Defense 3158 sexual abuse appear in 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office was. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But most abuses are reported at all and considered by the Pentagon&amp;#39;s own estimate of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 cases, which occur every year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, published in March examined the prosecution rates: 2010 20 percent of the recorded cases were in the military court, only half as many as in civil law. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiff in Burke&amp;#39;s case, describing their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In Lyman&amp;#39;s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she says, she has been asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape, a number of police officers, doctors and commanders. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people said, as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of which was ultimately acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> &amp;quot;I remember well the day when the verdict was read,&amp;quot; says Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> &amp;quot;I thought the labor would be used. I ran screaming from the courtroom.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1519"> &amp;quot;They took me to the psychiatric department, and I remember that I did when I came out, told my commander.. That was not his case this was my method&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed with a personality disorder and declared unfit for service. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010 she was dishonorably discharged, so that they receive no support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the action, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is progressing, is pure speculation, said John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Nevertheless, he notes, &amp;quot;In my view they should move forward.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first asked the question. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is lagging behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which brings with it a liability. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: &amp;quot;The odds are against them ... but it&amp;#39;s important for them to try it.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will change only when good people are willing to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke will begin the lawyer of the plaintiff, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs in future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> &amp;quot;We will fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform,&amp;quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whichever comes first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: As researchers observe on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before he became the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday had Breivik, who has confessed to having committed a school shooting in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent much time until his attack at his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists chat, support the far-right groups on social networking sites. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But how do you find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> That&amp;#39;s easy - you just need to log in to Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> &amp;quot;We have found that it was not difficult to come to them,&amp;quot; said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British think tank Demos on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebook&amp;#39;s hiding personal information is encyclopedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the page to their desired demographic data accurately determine with scientific accuracy - as do marketers for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartlett&amp;#39;s team found a half-million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and aimed them with adds, but related instead to be with a new band or a new diet product, invited the adds users to take a survey, in which according to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and assess their own future was asked. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues are able to more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries were to ask - without them even once had to leave her office. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> &amp;quot;It is a fairly new method of research,&amp;quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results come as no surprise. Online Sponsors of right-wing groups are mostly angry young, male, and about immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a surprising twist kind of &amp;quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism rational, democratic and less violent than those who remain sitting behind their computer screens.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1546"> DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Think tanks, political scientists and medical researchers use the site to study everything from health issues to trends in society &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot;, text messages and status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users, which add an average of three content per day, generated Facebook&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;data Supernova,&amp;quot; a research boom that could increase the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by almost 800%. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study through this site people who would normally not reach with his clipboard on the street. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> &amp;quot;If you tried before, people to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1551"> &amp;quot;They had to inform the first party and which was never granted access to them,&amp;quot; says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> &amp;quot;If Facebook is this all away - go directly to them.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the site offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook, significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on the subject. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno suggests that peer students to monitor, for example, residential advisors, the page and help students when they postet too many status updates. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> &amp;quot;You can not solve a problem if you did not see it,&amp;quot; said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno&amp;#39;s co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children&amp;#39;s Research Institute in the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> &amp;quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk, which would have otherwise found.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook taps also constantly on the data of its own population. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The data team at the site has statistics on the relationship status, Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, turnout in the midterm elections in 2010 and were National Happiness Index created (used primarily by looking at the information, which only has Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long known that the side of their should make large data repository accessible to others for research purposes.) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> However, users of Facebook know that the page they observed whether they like it or not. To a friend who is thousands of miles away, to play Scrabble, can allow one side to deploy their own personal information. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook is part of a survey, from which they do not even know something? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have a strict set of guidelines on how they collect their data offline, online anything goes. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> &amp;quot;I do not think many people have ever thought about the fact that a researcher might study their profiles,&amp;quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study from 2006 in which he, the public pages of students studied on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> &amp;quot;What they are concerned, it was all about her and her friends.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the statements are true in a user profile and contributions. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> &amp;quot;What they say on Facebook, and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,&amp;quot; says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools, anyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> &amp;quot;There is no substitute for the real world go out and talk to real people,&amp;quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> &amp;quot;Social research must attend to the social - and a lot of social life still happens offline.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1572"> &amp;quot;Cold and inhuman,&amp;quot; Anders Breivik Behring first appears before a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Anders Breivik Behring, the man who has been two shootings in which this summer in Norway has 77 people were killed himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a &amp;quot;resistance&amp;quot; fighters described. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> &amp;quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar in Norway,&amp;quot; he told a courtroom with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> &amp;quot;I raise an objection to the court, since you received your mandate of organizations that support the ideologies of hatred, multiculturalism and because it is supported.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1576"> &amp;quot;I acknowledge the laws but I do not plead guilty.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he &amp;quot;did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can bring his views to express.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, leave, turn to the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered that the police reserves Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody, he spent four weeks without access to the media. He said that the authorities of all visits and all correspondence will control just over eight weeks. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some were hoping to be able to see into the eyes Breivik, others wanted to confirm that it remains under lock and key. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Everyone participated with the aim that everything boils down to an incarceration. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> &amp;quot;I thought, he seems cold and inhuman,&amp;quot; said a survivor of Utoya the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> &amp;quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a step further, since I have seen the suspect and heard.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and then left. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> Despite Breiviks bizarre note, he would be part of a larger &amp;quot;resistance&amp;quot; movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It may suit some, that the attacks of 22 July seems to be the work of an individual and not the extremists was a radical group. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But makes it easy to automatically grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> &amp;quot;I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not,&amp;quot; said the relatives of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> &amp;quot;It would be so much easier if he did.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which this week has been shown in a theater </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared with some of his Henry Ford and the engineering genius picked it out as a great modern inventors. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What to find Apple fans but perhaps most telling in the recently rediscovered job interview that has been dusted off this week before feature presentations in major markets, is to understand how much of this creative force business processes and workflows. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who tinkered busily diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from &amp;quot;a disease of thinking&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;a truly great idea makes up 90 percent of the work ... [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1595"> In 1995, Bob Cringely, the TV series &amp;quot;Triumph of the nerds&amp;quot; on the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat for over an hour, along with jobs in which they performed a rare, detailed conversations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time had passed than 10 years since Apple had been forced out of jobs. And he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of Cringleys interview was used to track specialists, he says, that the master copies of the interview were missing on delivery. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> It was only after Jobs&amp;#39;s death it was discovered a complete copy of VHS in the garage of the Director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the film 68minütigen &amp;quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview,&amp;quot; which is this Wednesday and Thursday at the Landmark Theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who is well known that he abhors in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly busy here in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> During the interview it comes to four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds pondering where jobs clearly weighing his thoughts and endeavors to accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also times when jobs come &amp;#39;perfectionism to light when he apparently responded impatiently for him anschubst Cringelys questions and more quickly respond to themes or subplots of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost interview appears somehow incredibly far-sighted, if rated jobs, do what other companies he believes is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of computing. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing, posthumous tributes read the career jobs&amp;#39;. But jobs here to be seen as the avid dreamer who is on the verge of greatness, something is very different, original and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things could be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Shortly after this here is accomplished, he went and did it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost interview: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> How he learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> &amp;quot;Throughout the years in business I always ask:&amp;quot; Why are you doing things? &amp;quot;And the answer that you are getting is.&amp;quot; Oh, so it is easy to make. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks about things in depth. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I&amp;#39;ve found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs will continue its efforts of, to streamline the accounting records at Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Amazed at how costs have been recorded - usually began one with &amp;quot;standard cost&amp;quot;, which were estimated to be mere conjecture to and which were then matched with &amp;quot;deviation&amp;quot; - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the cost of doing business could be determined down to the smallest . </seg>
<seg id="1615"> As the Pope was ridiculed: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs talks about the &amp;quot;blue box&amp;quot;, which he built with Steve Wozniak, has a device that lets you sneak into the phone company and could result in long-distance calls for free. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> About the unit has been written about much, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a paid phone, make a call and then connect from an AT &amp;amp; T network to another as they grind through as many satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> &amp;quot;We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and if you bellowed into the phone, it was one minutes later the phone out next door again,&amp;quot; says Jobs, chuckling. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> &amp;quot;We were young and we learned that we can create something for yourself, can control the billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Both of us, we did not know much, but we did not build this little thing that can control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I do not think it would be without Apple. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious trick Wozniak and he almost pulled off, as they in the middle of the night via the Blue Box at the Vatican called and wanted to speak with the Pope, as best they could while Henry Kissinger imitated. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with American diplomats, the two had to laugh out before the Pope himself got on the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As he was in love with the technology (and unexpectedly called Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years ago when he was looking for replacement parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received for summer jobs part time job at Hewlett-Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> &amp;quot;It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company that I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he was &amp;quot;the first desktop computer that was ever produced,&amp;quot; saw. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with the Braun tube, and I fell in love with him. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would climb at HP as a teenager and hanging up on this machine and write programs for them. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How to improve innovation: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times a job interview, how to spontaneously invent new products. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career when he attached some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He worked with a payment deadline by thinking of only 30 days and had both the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> &amp;quot;I remember at sweeping arguments ... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, the $ 300 would cost] and I got up, went outside and found a manufacturer.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to build for $ 15. That was incredibly believable. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> About big companies, the decrease: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions into stumbling and lost control of their shares advance. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you better make a copier or printer, so what?&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are such people], which ultimately lead the company and the product with which people are forced out of the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The product genius that led to this monopoly, is from people who have no concept about good vs. products. bad products, cut - Crafts necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> This happened at Xerox ... </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox could have the whole computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> It would have been ten times greater than can be that Microsoft could have been the 1990s ... </seg>
<seg id="1647"> They got the defeat from victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> On innovation as an art form: </seg>

<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the laws of health, accepts as a court case </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the day of the gathering of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question of whether it will hear a challenge to the health law by President Obama, two measures of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner which was sponsored by the law firm that represented the case to court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine justices came to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases was treated to an action, 26 states have raised against the far-reaching health care reform, the last year have been decided by Congress, a bill that among conservative activists everywhere in the U.S. was a buzzword. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judge agreed with the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected probably the result of which will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, which at the time when the court decision is announced, will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the law is to tilt will probably be Paul Clement, former Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements Law Firm, PLLC Bancroft was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group that is dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day represents one of the industry associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, to challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process enormously. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case, place in a Washington hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Service had, among other things Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health care reform </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: the two judges visit the Federalist Society events for years. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And that does not violate ethical rules. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, judges freed from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states that: &amp;quot;A judge may participate in fundraisers law related and other organizations, the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or as per the program does not host such events.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas filed two out of the case related to law firms and a company with a strong financial interest in this to alert morality and government activists. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> &amp;quot;This startling break with morality and contrary to the Code punishes the actions of certain judges lie, the Court should consider itself to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&amp;quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a citizens&amp;#39; rights movement in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> &amp;quot;The judges and won over a dinnierten Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending before the court.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Their presence and support of a fundraiser for this event undermine any claim to impartiality, and are not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics who say it would matter to court lightly with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society, mix. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And Thomas&amp;#39; wife, Ginni is a known conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> By contrast, the conservatives argue that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance before a judge. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Your critics urged Kagan, withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, since it is involved too much in the defense of the law to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan makes no attempt to do so. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Boeing takes record order of 18 trillion dollars worth of land </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Emirates airline ordered 50 two-course Boeing 777 with an option for 20 additional aircraft. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> In addition, six Boeing Dreamliner, Boeing sold to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $ 1 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> It is truly a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 units of its products. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But it&amp;#39;s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft as a whole is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines needed from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2520 airplanes worth 450 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Boeing announced at the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft, based on the value of the order: 50, two popular Boeing 777 jets. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The hammer was commissioned by the Dubai based Emirates Airline. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> The airline has also, so Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which can increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars. </seg>

<seg id="1695"> The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &amp;quot;This is absolutely positive for Boeing,&amp;quot; said Neal Dihora, stock market expert to Morningstar. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> &amp;quot;The quality of this particular customer is very high.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Many airlines in the Middle East are in the possession of the oil-producing countries. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> So they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which harms the airlines in general, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not as damaging as the country deserves a higher oil price. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> &amp;quot;They have a natural hedge,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The appointment of Emirates Boeing confirms leadership position in the market for large aircraft and helps keep the rival Airbus SAS in check, attacking the supremacy of the A350. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> Boeing&amp;#39;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay deployment of the main A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> They postponed the launch to gain more confidence after the customer had a higher payload and range required. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $ 67.94. </seg>

<seg id="1711"> &amp;quot;They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have voting booths occupied, roadblocks set up ... and asked people to vote for the [PRI].&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1712"> The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Vallejo seems to have struck just Claderon, which had led in the polls before election day. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Calderon, a conservative candidate of the Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> Silvano aureoles, the candidate of the PRD left Democratic Revolutionary Party, the current lame duck governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-hand guide for the presidential election in 2012. </seg>

<seg id="1722"> The violence is still going on. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Maria Luisa Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear of the local elections. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> The PRI victory strengthens the party, no matter how distasteful the elections appear also in Michoacan. </seg>

<seg id="1727"> The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world, &amp;quot;everything in your power,&amp;quot; must do to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc, either by the International Monetary Fund, or by direct mutual agreements. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the &amp;quot;dispassionate&amp;quot; look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leaders and European resources through Asia a long-term collapse of the global economy helps prevent. </seg>

<seg id="1732"> &amp;quot;Asia may be protected up to a certain extent, but it is not immune.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1733"> &amp;quot;If China and India can help so, then by all means.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1734"> Europe&amp;#39;s monetary union in recent months, fell into a severe debt crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> In recent days, Italy&amp;#39;s increased interest costs on both dangerous and the Prime Minister of Italy and Greece have resigned. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> The emergence of severe debt crisis in Europe, stoking fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging countries should join forces to support the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Mr. Nag predicted that any support of Asia will be channeled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - offer its European partners in Asia, greater bargaining power - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that &amp;quot;India will do everything in his power&amp;quot; to help the euro zone, as the domestic economy is now suffering from the decline in exports and foreign capital flows drying out. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> &amp;quot;No one wants that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>

<seg id="1741"> &amp;quot;It is not an option, it&amp;#39;s a job, where else can we work for our millions of young men and women.&amp;quot; </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the Pentagon to potential cuts in the defense sector </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Defense Leon Panetta heated to Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. So he set off a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian production lines. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon is already considering cuts in the amount of 450 billion dollars in the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts are needed more by 600 trillion, or if Congress can not make a conclusion in the paper edition. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> &amp;quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,&amp;quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that a failure of the Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure would result in 23% overall cuts and a halt to many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> &amp;quot;Done Such a high reduction on such ill-considered way, most of our marine and construction projects would make impossible - you can not buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and hurt other modernization efforts seriously,&amp;quot; said Panetta to Senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> &amp;quot;We would also be forced to involuntarily separate us from many of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly be civilians with leave of absence in order to achieve this goal.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1756"> &amp;quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those who will maintain our military and harm our alert seriously.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts were finally meet the combat troops, &amp;quot;said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> &amp;quot;During the war time quotas are in the fight against terrorism by the seizure is not directly affected, would be of serious interference with the basic budget, the war effort adversely affect,&amp;quot; Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> &amp;quot;Personal settings have to be shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and adjust supervision, support the war.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1760"> &amp;quot;The salaries of the staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to dealers and the war would be legal and political support to be disturbed.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators, Panetta replied 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Department of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> &amp;quot;The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would begin a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1763"> &amp;quot;We are vehemently against this draconian action,&amp;quot; the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they Panetta&amp;#39;s letter published. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> &amp;quot;This is a result with which we can not live, and there is certainly none that we should impose ourselves.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1765"> &amp;quot;The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United Equip and their occurrence should not be permitted.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Increase if Panetta&amp;#39;s letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure to a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has increasingly blunt the possible cuts pronounced, although he was for many years to gain experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the forefront of the Pentagon, and knows that he is serious decisions to. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week in the defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead - with a military shell, but without a core. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> &amp;quot;There is a ship without sailors.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1770"> &amp;quot;There is a brigade without ammunition.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1771"> &amp;quot;There is an air force squadron without enough trained pilots.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &amp;quot;There is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission,&amp;quot; Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> &amp;quot;It is a force that lacks morality and alert and not in a position to take on potential adversaries.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1774"> &amp;quot;You can be a really angry.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an appendix to his letter to McCain and Graham led Panetta to new details, such as creating reductions &amp;quot;significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our use worldwide and Eingreiffähigkeit, resulting in an unacceptable risk to future military operations . &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> To this list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that require Army and Navy, to replace the Humvee. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> If you were to stop further development and testing of the F35, this would save over the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollars, but proponents say that it is an important next step in the upgrade, so that potential threats from China and other opponents can be dispelled. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How to unmasked a lie </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at the recent headlines shows how widespread and serious deception and lies far in our daily lives. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain is busy trying to meet the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, sir. Both sides accuse each other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The line of Penn State is accused of perjury because it has allegedly withheld reports, according to which has abused a retired football coach boys sexually. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In the past week was overheard on an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama asserted against, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers and shake countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he brought denials in circulation, which were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in campaign financing, which is related to the cover-up an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then of course nobody forgets who has experienced it, the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has raised, as he has lied about during his second term in the Oval Office, his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories of cheating in school and college examinations are common. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There were incidents in which teachers have their students exam answers given, so they stood well on their own performance reviews. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors who teach the contrary should send a message that lying and cheating are okay. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much fraud we are experiencing? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> As studies show, we lie every day 10-200 times </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Many of these lies are white lies but when. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that foreigners are lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> To detect lies and &amp;quot;expose lies&amp;quot; one, to learn which is important for everyone, and this is both personal and professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a board game such as charades away, where it is the goal, &amp;quot;Gotcha!&amp;quot; to call, is a serious deception uncloak a field of knowledge based on scientific data that were collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities, led by the far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> One result of the research is that most of the old myths were revealed about the lies. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies look in your eyes. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> They stutter, stammer, blush and fidget not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> From this one can not but conclude that these liars are difficult to detect and expose. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> A skilled Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth when he learns something about the structure of the allegation, the subtle facial expressions, making inquiries and timing. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I have spent several years trying to examine the scientific results of the extensive and growing range of unmasking. And it is clear that the uncloak a deception is an advanced skill that is easy to learn and our orientation in our complex world helps, especially when the setting or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration of their own professional responsibilities include . </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liars are very good at assessing other people, to arouse their interest and to control their own emotions. And they intuitively feel, how they are perceived by others. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research, we know, the extroverted people lie more often than introverts, that men often &amp;quot;self-oriented&amp;quot; telling lies than women whose lies &amp;quot;based on other&amp;quot; more - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell, are mostly &amp;quot;fat lies&amp;quot;). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that if a person has been exposed as a wrongdoer, while others feel less guilty for having lied to this person. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> How can you tell whether someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> First, by observing the normal behavior of that person. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is called &amp;quot;baselining&amp;quot; the starting position. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It provides a reference point for future evaluation of changes before. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know better, when someone trots normally constantly with his foot, so that they do not wrongly accused when he trots during a meeting with his foot. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then pay attention to striking accumulations of verbal and nonverbal behaviors. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Consider these clusters as alarm bells ringing, not as evidence of an unmasking. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who deceive freeze, perhaps, if they try to remember their history. Maybe their feet pointing towards the door, or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a &amp;quot;relaxation after the interview,&amp;quot; this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Questioner often incorrectly indicate that an interview is over, just to keep after this relaxation after the interview on the lookout. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Also watch for the language of your subject. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past tense, as he claimed his wife was dead still alive and sparking a national search for her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Deceptive persons may also use a distancing language, &amp;quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&amp;quot; or if you repeat a tricky question as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most common verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use &amp;quot;qualifying language&amp;quot; when they answer a tricky question: &amp;quot;Well ... to tell you the truth ... as I understand it ... to the best of my knowledge and belief.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1821"> This response is more perceptive than factual, which often set off alarm bells. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no magic formula for exposing lies, but you can learn skills that have revealed a possible unmasking. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> These capabilities can rarely be any victim of fraud, both in private and professional life. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> Controversial plan will be revised after an oil pipeline hazards caused by delayed U.S. approval </seg>
<seg id="1825"> A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which is the union is angry, while environmentalists reassured that the pipeline be built companies trying to plan the project again, so you can return to normalcy. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> Trans-Canada said on Monday that it will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of ​​the Sand Hills in Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> The company announced the decision at a press conference in Parliament House from Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> Alex said Pourbax Trans Canada that the company was still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, albeit with a different course. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This occurred after an announcement by the State Department in the past week, after which would be to postpone a decision on a federal approval for the project was reviewed by the new potential gradient that the area of ​​the Sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a In large water supply shun. </seg>

<seg id="1863"> In the first year that is Mario López Valdez of the government, rose in Sinaloa, unemployment and illegal work, while the decreased foreign investment and the economy stagnated. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> 2011 will remain in the economic history of Sinaloa in memory. It is the first year, at which fueled Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and high hopes about economic growth, is in the government. However, due to climatic adversities can be no question, but rather a deterioration of the main economic indicators of growth. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The low temperatures in February, not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but put also the growth of the state economy strong boundaries and caused in the first quarter, a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent This is mainly due to the historical degradation of agricultural development to 31.16 percent, which benefited the brakes on further economic sectors. </seg>

<seg id="1870"> &amp;quot;What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity, market losses due to cuts in funding by the legislation that was passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally amass U.S. dollars, it is not easy to have them work for you to invest it or use it for something else, &amp;quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Migration stopped </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Lopez Cervantes pointed out that rising unemployment is inherent also a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> &amp;quot;The number of people who left the country seeking work abroad, particularly in the United States has decreased. On the one hand stay due to the immigration problems and partly because it is difficult there to find work. These people search here and work here, which in turn increases unemployment, &amp;quot;he says. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Moonlighting </seg>
<seg id="1875"> The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of undeclared work. These include according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without pay into the coffers of Social Security. </seg>

According to the Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), FDI from January to June totaled $ 630,597, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $ 5,143,312 during the same period last year. </seg>

The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well coordinated attuned Government teams are not been sufficiently coordinated, &amp;quot;he said. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Slow economic development </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Lopez Loredo said that events such as the frost made it difficult at the beginning of the economic development of the country and slowed. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> &amp;quot;The small business flow is the result of several events, including the chill. One of the most important impact is a slowing economy that is not enough in motion to produce a dynamic economy, which could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, We finish the year well below our expectations, &amp;quot;he said. </seg>

<seg id="1985"> Monti has managed in less than three days to form a government that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt in an excessive level. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> The new, guided by former Commissioner Monti government must adopt a tough austerity package, which was supported by the Euro politicians to regain confidence in the ailing Italian. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The pressure to rush bearing down on Monticello, was reinforced by the fluctuating market conditions, due to the Italian government bonds for 10 years at 7 percent interest was charged. This corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti said: &amp;quot;We said we would support this government for all forces.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="1989"> We believe that this government is the last chance to come out of Italy this emergency situation. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> The chances of success were Montis by supporting the party of Silvio Berlusconi&amp;#39;s PDL, which on Saturday had to withdraw due to the crisis, increased significantly. </seg>

<seg id="1992"> The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed a majority made up of technocrats government, which just makes Monti. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> Support by the Parliament </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The new government needs a strong parliamentary support Monti for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Resistance to his efforts, or postponing the reforms could again result in a devastating attack by the financial markets. </seg>

<seg id="1999"> Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in response to the crisis in an extremely fast change of government in motion. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> After a brief sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, are due to uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds again reached critical levels. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current EU rescue package. </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Monti said his government had until the next elections to be held probably in 2013, last, in spite of predictions that the politicians will just give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the preferred options. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Monti said he would like to take politicians to his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of engineers, an indication of their concerns about the financial markets imposed by the pressure of the process. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Political sources indicate that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the games, the inclusion of people from the political life more complicated. </seg>

<seg id="2039"> This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it&amp;#39;s been great. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> I&amp;#39;m the only one vacation in Costa Rica have been. It is such a beautiful country that we are still determined to stay there for a few days. </seg>

<seg id="2046"> Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Does not that a bit of pressure out of your visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest shows we have laid in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We played a couple of big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to have made us ready for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Really, we feel like playing there. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle. For this part of Costa Rica to the best country in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> As you&amp;#39;ve come to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing? </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> My friends are always down for surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the areas are excellent for surfing. In this way, about people who love to surf, we have learned from it. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> With an eye on the tour with their giant shows have offered many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Since we have never played there, we are also no limits. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a good and varied repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> You never repeat your repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think this is partly so because we have nine boards and play over 120 songs can. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision, which we will play each, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> If we take two or three songs we have not played for some time, the repertoire, we can focus our better maintained and they surprise us, because we recall the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that is why for the audience. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> This tour will celebrate its twenty years of your history. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If you look back, you find it hard to believe in your success? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, totally. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I believe that none of us has imagined, to play once in a great rock band, and the long and another 20 years. That seems like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We continue to follow these blessings and find it great, even now still together to make music. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We like each other and are excited to produce music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world we wanted to visit ever want. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It has always been an honor to be among this group of big bands. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising and unusually plentiful, if a movement emerges from a group of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups come simultaneously from the same city. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes, we always play together yet. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Soundgarden we saw on their tour. We are pleased to still be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that arose. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together for so long with the same musicians. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands survive. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and well we take care of each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friends, why have musical avenues opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> One trusts the other and his music. We could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success you could always do what you wanted. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> How do you find a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The way we have grown, it has made us easy to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We make sure not too many times to be on tour, because it is too easy to succumb to this game with huge masses of people who love your music. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as one remembers that the people came for the music, you have to remember the fact that you are the music and what she has brought into being sure, not eager to be a famous rock star appeal. That has never interested anyway. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> What memories do you have of your other project, Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we have very good written songs and at the beginning it was great. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were a band for three years, which had until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never released an album. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which are built up with the band and friends. When I hear a song or see pictures, I think that was an incredible man Andy and how he made me laugh. There was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> He was an extraordinary person and we miss him. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Is it true that you know their work, in particular, have Eddie Vedder and the band therefore chosen for the opening? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos from multiple groups, and this band we liked best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Roberta can offer live. This will definitely exciting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why do the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter changes every time you play live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That&amp;#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> By whom were you influenced as a bass player? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Of so many + </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first that come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ... </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass player that I like. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How about Pearl Jam has managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer just a fad? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we all do not feel very connected to the word grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, I remember the bands that I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time. Although they are still important today, I think it&amp;#39;s great because it&amp;#39;s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> At first their music was dark, now it is positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> That&amp;#39;s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album, something that might seem frivolous. But there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> On both I was in tears when I heard it played like Ed. There are very dark song. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - affects your music and your artistic work and these two songs represent the clear for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> However, I also believe that a happy person, and can still make dark music. </seg>

<seg id="2169"> Everything indicates that the nightmares have found the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the road Balmes an end. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday afternoon that they had illegally occupied and organized them into the big festivals that the neighborhood had been driven to despair. The evacuation took place without a court order without police intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> After the eviction, the door lock has been changed to avoid a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> &amp;quot;As of now, the entry will be checked,&amp;quot; confirmed the caretaker. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> The squatters who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were occupied - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and leave all kinds of garbage, especially with doses of alcoholic beverages. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> In the three lower floors were held huge parties, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to desperation. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Besides the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damage them. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Its owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that their business would have declined since the beginning of the squat by 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> The owner of the nightclub pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition because they were selling the drinks to three euro, and they cost € 10 at the discotheque. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> It was also the owner of the recreational premises of the neighbors complaining about noise were displayed while they claim the noise is not by visitors to the disco stemmed, but by the squatters, and in particular of the guests at the celebrations that were organized there, and, according to the Angry neighbors in recent weeks, more and more. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> The manager of the nightclub, said that the harassment was so great that they agree with the owner of the building was to have to pay for the last nine months no rent. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they have in recent weeks received more complaints from the neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Popular Party) in the city council of Barcelona, ​​Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week to evacuate the building immediately and get the problems of civic coexistence and the coming down of the district under control. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but that the squatters were penetrated in recent months to all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some there was even come to shoplift. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> In this sense, he added that &amp;quot;it was necessary to put an end to impunity and anti-social acts in which access to the building.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2184"> Yesterday another building in the district of Nou Barris of the Catalan police were cleared. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> At 15.30 clock approached the police, the Montral Road No. 35, after she received a call from a neighbor who had watched four people wanted to enter the building. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> The four were arrested immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects are apart from the arguments about the fees agreed with the tender. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The tender for the city 16 gates opened the debate about the meaning of Collserola in Barcelona again. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Mid-1980s, the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its diatribe on the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as a giant park in Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was even compared with figures in the Central Park of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many back among the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that does not spread into north-south direction, but up (mountains) and bottom ( Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification as a nature park Collserolas plays with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> Served as the model no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with feral pigs in the role of Yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far it was, as the city in September, a huge call, consisting of 16 contests, spending more for access to gates Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> Undoubtedly, the concept refers to a gate of a park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either this is so, or someone who intends to make gates to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question is obvious: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The tender is not only from an organizational point of view but also in terms of a reflection on the city the talk of the mouth of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It&amp;#39;s been almost a recurrent theme, the two members of this long-established caste, who meet in the elevator to fall back, can. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And this very fact the material provides for one of the few similarities between what to think about three architects from Barcelona, ​​and some university professors who have applied for the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldan, Daniel and Marta Modol Bayona: The contract is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> For Roldán &amp;quot;it is necessary&amp;quot; to speak after the attack on the coast of the &amp;quot;front on the mountains&amp;quot;, as far as the discourse of Ildefonso Cerda, who over the green apples, is not been held. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> &amp;quot;We should proceed from the principle that Barcelona&amp;#39;s largest park, the beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, &amp;quot;says the architect, for the title&amp;quot; &amp;quot;contains within itself: it must not be&amp;quot; gates of Collserola &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; lexical case of as entrances to a park, but as a restriction of areas to act on those needs. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol as Roldan and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an &amp;quot;intellectual challenge&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;some risks&amp;quot; conceals within itself. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risks posed by the &amp;quot;uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it these days&amp;quot; after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of ​​the Forum had their &amp;quot;swan song&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first concern is their own limit to what can be built. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> &amp;quot;Something always does narrow to determine the next step&amp;quot;, ie going over. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> &amp;quot;You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the General Plan, Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol who consider themselves more closely to the question says simplify, the site of Collserola that goes in the direction Vallesana, &amp;quot;can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona&amp;quot;, and this for purely topographical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol reminded that there is already a degree of patronage de Collserola that is not &amp;quot;should fall on deaf ears,&amp;quot; although he was the city administration thankful that she has given his body the way &amp;quot;from the first moment&amp;quot; in this project participate. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> He also noted that the proximity of the mountains to the city of safe conduct, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although his &amp;quot;doubt&amp;quot; statement as to whether this technical profile which launched multi-disciplinary teams (&amp;quot;exactly the right, &amp;quot;he says) should instruct&amp;quot; We architects should only be a tool. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer is complex to the question in the title of this article, as lacking in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola: &amp;quot;There have been tendered 16 competitions in cross section,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;on the axis of the mountains, the sea. But there are no longitudinal perspective, which views the region as a whole. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2217"> This has, at least in his case meant that he participates in the 16 contests. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate with the architects of the gate next to it would collide. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In his opinion the city should guarantee absolutely that the strips directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so equipped, the result is a smoother transition between urban and green areas. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal which is freely </seg>
<seg id="2221"> After 72 days of silence, freeing the agent of the Casino Red&amp;#39;s brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the process, which is run against him for alleged extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> After 72 days in captivity Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent for the Red Casino has forgiven him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, leading the case against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> After the attack on the Casino Royale released Sergio Gil Garcia, owner of the Casino Red, a series of photos and videos to see where Manuel Jonás is that it forces allegedly to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration&amp;#39;s secret operation of the betting house approved. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> According to the criminal complaint, the prosecutor opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor panistischen, on 2 Was arrested September for 30 days. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to the Casa de Barrio Antiguo Arraigo 1 in the capital. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the officers of the Ministerio Público had rejected the offenses of bribery and organized crime. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> On 19 October he was transferred to the prison of Cadereyta, because he had allegedly bribed the owner of Red Casino and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in the medium security prison, as death threats against him were available. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of the prison city of San Nicolas de los Garza. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> On 25 October he was sent to the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yáñez, a prison regulation. He discovered that after the nearly two-month investigation EXIST sufficient evidence to convict Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house, to open this in turn can. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> This Monday asked the representative of Red Casino, Víctor García Gómez Aldo Judge Jose Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor, the penalty issue, which is why he is put in the hours released. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> During the court hearing said Ramiro Arias, the clerk of the court assigned the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, whether this damage was repaired and the owner of the betting house which had expressed his forgiveness. The lawyer gave the name back, however. </seg>

<seg id="2236"> The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details about the aircraft accident in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed and known. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transportation in Mexico) informed that indicate the findings of the accident in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed and that the helicopter with his whole undamaged structure is slammed directly against the ground, without the pilot had made an emergency landing can take. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At a press conference said Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather conditions were suitable for flight. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> &amp;quot;The fact that the propeller blades had been in contact with trees 25 meters high, with the fuselage of the helicopter lost, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several contacts the ground.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2240"> He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transportation of personnel. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> He also said that the investigations in the field, on which the machine was run down, no helicopter parts were found. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> &amp;quot;During the search no airplane parts were found in other places, the charge related to the entire structure. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transportation. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The area has a bevel 7-30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> Currently the priority is to get the test results as soon as possible, but this could several months, maybe even take a year. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> For its part, assured Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliaries (Secretariat for aircraft and support services in Mexico), the Estado Mayor Presidential helicopters flown on impact with cruise speed and the plane fell on a soft slope. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> &amp;quot;This information strengthens the assumption that this was the time of impact to a normal flight operations.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2248"> At a press conference included the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome on six relevant issues that should be considered in the study: </seg>
<seg id="2249"> VFR: </seg>
<seg id="2250"> In line with the flight standards it was a flight to the rules of perspective flight. This means that the team would have had during the flight and ground-sufficient view. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The AICM suitable weather conditions recorded at the start. During the connecting flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State went on a few low clouds. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Selected routes: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is possible that the team was selected because of the clouds, a lower area with a better view towards the valley of Cuernavaca. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Point of impact: </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are the same. Perhaps there has been no impact from the loss of control of the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight path. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The available information to date suggests that the helicopter straight and lateral direction was bounced. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of the plane scattered remnants suggest that the helicopter was bounced with its intact structure on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No evidence of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The remains of the aircraft at the accident site can offer neither fire nor with explosive. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The last survey results indicate several surface contacts. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> The investigations on the spot aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is steep and has a skew of seven to thirty degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is gone likely to break. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Some data indicate that the helicopter could have had several contacts the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a thorough search on an area that went beyond the roped-off area at the scene could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforces the assumption that the structure was intact plane slammed into the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS announces a research protocol to locate the gene for obesity </seg>
<seg id="2268"> She leads a Mexican Social Security Institute research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Institute) announced that it directs a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title &amp;quot;Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth,&amp;quot; with which the genetic markers associated found to be overweight. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz Lopez, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica s Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, specializing in Biochemistry) at the Hospital Clinic de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers set up was. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) del Instituto Nacional Politécnico (IPN). </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday will be conducted from 8:00 clock tests with children and adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtemoc (west of the State of Mexico) and since 8 Will continue in October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the State of Mexico). </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the goal is reached 500-600 study subjects, the study is on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and continued on the Morelos (in the north of the capital district) completed. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He explained that the purpose of this study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in conjunction with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> To mark the world day of diabetes, he said it would strive to represent three thousand children and teenagers between the ages of six and should complete 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents&amp;#39; nutritional questionnaires. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family medical history to risk factors, diabetes or renal failure could result in control. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He stated further, measured to the mentioned Saturday, the study subjects (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure checks and blood tests such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood ) were determined. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz Lopez emphasized that this investigation would be carried out at the concerns of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight of young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &amp;quot;Resulted in the health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 that was in almost six years has increased the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 per cent of the girls with obesity by 47 percent. The obesity had increased dramatically,&amp;quot; said the specialist, the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified, because the genetic history of the Mexican population differences from that of other nations. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He stated that a (n) Mexicans (in) was on average 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity in the context . </seg>
<seg id="2283"> More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity push in the inability to burn the excess of taken us energy (calories) from, so this will be stored as fat. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers explained that the direct benefits for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, would be found in whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It would even investigated the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inside arms (acanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All information was kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to parents all the measurement results and beat them in front of lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz Lopez said that there were three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases, sedentary lifestyle, which means lack of movement in everyday life that most of the day to spend watching television and use of transport, rather than short distances to feet to go. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high caloric intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics that will be analyzed in this research project. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM developed with polymer modified asphalt, the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and compared to temperature fluctuations </seg>
<seg id="2291"> If the signs emanating from the pavement, respected, it would not be required to repair almost 200 000 potholes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of ​​the Valley of Mexico) erupts, said to Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt pavement geschähe appropriate to reduce the number of potholes significantly or even completely avoided. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his lecture &amp;quot;potholes from a technical point of view,&amp;quot; he occasion was the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with polymer-modified asphalts develop to create a the asphalt-like mixture, but greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures has. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Nájera Herrera said that this kind of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some northern cities in the country, should be used to improve the behavior of the pavement and thus to avoid the occurrence of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a hydrocarbon compound, is a part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Viscoelastic behavior of asphalt means that this is at high temperatures close to 180 ° C behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C, it is very viscous and fixed at 50 ° C, almost, as it is brittle at low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &amp;quot;This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but varies on a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations&amp;quot;, said the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researchers noted the FQ, the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible pavement, which is composed is composed of six layers of materials, which included the last three asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the upper layers of lies, a wear layer of asphalt, which drenched from small, then there is solidified in asphalt and stones. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Each one of these stones wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles are to move and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the pavement. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> &amp;quot;If it was modified asphalt, the forces would spread out even better,&amp;quot; said the chemical engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> &amp;quot;On the wear layer,&amp;quot; he explained, &amp;quot;a final coat is laid, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, ie sand, which was bathed in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Since this layer is in contact with vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and they must produce friction. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> On this road surface most forces receives and distributes the base course also requires an adequate thickness and the material of which it consists, shall be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations are more important factors to consider, especially the water, &amp;quot;he said,&amp;quot; because it affects the behavior of the wear layer significantly. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the ground is wet, water enters into the film and appears only in hard back. This causes a weakening of all layers of the pavement and consequently the occurrence of potholes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If a pothole is formed, &amp;quot;he said,&amp;quot; is first removed the top layer, while the wear layer will only affect it. But the damage is not immediate, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first sign of appropriate maintenance programs. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the Sistema Nacional de investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) said that the vehicle load is another important reason for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the pavement always be in proportion to vehicle load and the need to ensure that compliance is the avoidance of many potholes this regulation. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research projects were slow in coming, for example, on asphalt emulsions that are in other countries is even already on the market, and where the potholes were repaired easily and without using high temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What was missing the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ramirez Serna, the crown of Miss Colombia did not get. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle receives his 14th Miss title. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Once again went blank from Valle del Cauca in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the band that identifies them as the new Miss Colombia, to make a show. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> By that night result obtained in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar was in itself, the department is already at 14 Miss title and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which held the crown almost in the hands had. The proclaimed Misses include: Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque ( 1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question that many ask today is: What was missing? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result is the demise of a great favorite, who had shown at each screening, they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing was she the queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie was chosen by Vogue, title, and the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia at home. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor that is considered critical to the decision of the jury to nominate them for the first miss, is that they are the answer to the question &amp;quot;What book has influenced you most and why?&amp;quot; To it by Martín Gómez of Murillo been made of the Carreta Literaria Leamos was, had not convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> &amp;quot;I read a lot, I think pretty much in the literature, I think it&amp;#39;s a way to civilize themselves, ultimately I think that the book that shaped my childhood for most, &amp;#39;The Little Prince&amp;#39; is a very deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the moment I read &amp;#39;Crime and Punishment&amp;#39;. It is a book of universal culture, which we should all read. I&amp;#39;m reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that `Leidenschaften&amp;#39;heißt. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> One answer, which met with little approval, firstly because of the term `to zivilisieren&amp;#39;und secondly, because they had not specifically stated, had influenced the way in which each of her book, she said. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after the ceremony, Melina, to feel calm and happy with the result: &amp;quot;The universe is as it happens, what needs to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all people: Please read a bit of `The Little Prince &amp;#39;. It is a great book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things, is said to be the darling of El Valle is burned out. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred, which reaped all Beifälle and had received in advance all prices (catering competition Easter, public vote on the best-made visual costume and Reina Madre), &amp;quot;the other candidates had been jealous, what stresste the Queen, who therefore could not shine on stage. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And you could see in her first performance in swimsuit at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators at the coronation ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although they both appeared safe, but she lacked the strength and momentum that featured representatives from the Magdalena and Atlántico on display. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the &amp;quot;Como en Casa&amp;quot; for channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, &amp;quot;shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition, but not finally becomes queen.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2330"> In addition, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that the Jury regarding Valle convince her interest in social work could not understand what is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> It&amp;#39;ll have a reason, said that two days prior to the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who dedicated herself to the social affairs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> &amp;quot;Beauty alone for Miss Colombia is not enough. One must also look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that they had worked before entering the competition on projects,&amp;quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with their defects in the derriere and fibrosis, which is noted in her stomach. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose as a candidate for &amp;#39;natural beauty&amp;#39; with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernan Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body that there are better there, &amp;quot;but their problem was with the fibrosis of the abdomen, for me to be honest hardly noticeable, their scores expressed on the last Day. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2336"> Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos of view, the problem of women from Valle del Cauca, the surgical intervention, which they had subjected themselves were. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> &amp;quot;The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how they should let them do it right. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Her body has never been her strong suit, and that body had to pay them. &amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this award, the first awarded by the National Beauty Contest, created after the show in a bathing suit is a cruel prediction that should be true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had been a consolation prize, so as not to have come to enjoy the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Whether that&amp;#39;s true or not, the fact is that Melina today takes up her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers them the opportunity to appoint the National Pageant Colombia in an international competition to represent . </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, they will go down as one of the queens, who had escaped, despite their overwhelming presence of the crown in Cartagena, in the story. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Such was the work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A Lophoskopist from Cali emerged as the man who &amp;quot;Alfonso Cano&amp;quot;, identified in the story. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials play a key role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On 4 November was a Lophoskopist the determination unit of prosecution (CTI) from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed one, &amp;quot;Alfonso Cano&amp;quot; by comparing the fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the Department of CTI, this week Eliazar Gonzalez-call service, a man in Puerto Tejada had a collaborator for 21 years in criminal investigations. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in communities of Chocó, where he had to go frequently for five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were located, he should identify. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> In 2000 he moved to Valle on and after the completion of required courses, he specialized in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin that is exposed to friction, ie the palms and soles. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> The week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Something big was waiting for him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew he should identify two corpses, and that it was suspected that might be one of the man who is the oldest guerrilla who led the world. Therefore, he should take the ten finger-print of Guillermo León Sáenz sheet (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But when he reached the place with the Untersuchungste where was the corpse, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was similar to figures he had seen in the mass media, not in the least. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was very much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints do not lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a trowel and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse as that on the print sheet. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He had been right: it was &amp;quot;Alfonso Cano&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Still the same night was the native of Puerto Tejada man responsible for the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón tell that it was indeed the leader of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Looking for clues </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen Sijin from Cali was the appreciation that the President Juan Manuel Santos Gonzalez Eliazar at a press conference on the use to &amp;quot;Cano&amp;quot; they bestowed, very important. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people do not know our work. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The fingerprinting is an exact science without errors, which can be a key factor in the reversal of a criminal offense. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten identify not only dead bodies, they also assist investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> With their arrest, put many criminals with false identity papers, or they have none. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We take them off the fingerprints and looking them in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researchers told us that he had stolen a piece of crack in a wall of a house had to be propped up because the thief at this very spot with his hand as he drew out a stuffed with jewelery and cash safe. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> &amp;quot;Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting are. But in this case, we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and the offenders who had participated in several thefts identify,&amp;quot; he recalled. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> Fingerprints can also use the murder suspects are released or charged. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently, a dead body was found surrounded by liquor bottles. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> In the determination has been suggested that a family member could be A suspect, and actually voted a fingerprint match on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is still the place where the offense was committed, taken in context. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist the CTI stated that &amp;quot;the fingerprints of chemical or physical reagents were taken from the object.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2373"> When they appear, a trowel or a tape is used for the taking. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> After the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the Civil Status Office. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> &amp;quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&amp;quot; the expert explained by the CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He said that not everything is as it was depicted in the TV series SCI. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> Just as all is not gold that glitters, is not all that it touches a fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But still it can be used when performing an appropriate comparison. </seg>

<seg id="2406"> GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and end the spiral of the free fall in early March </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that lead onto a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that Japan is the second World War I had experienced. </seg>

<seg id="2413"> Nevertheless, the actual change in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build infrastructure or build new. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> Woke up, Japan is mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which now represents 60% of Japanese GDP. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> This variable increased by 1%, triggered by the increasing expenditure on cars, travel and leisure activities. </seg>

<seg id="2458"> The CDU is proposing to elect the EU president because of general voting </seg>
<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the program, but has prevailed in the fall, especially to those activists do enough to assess the government&amp;#39;s policy with regard to the Greeks in Italy today and tomorrow may be too lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> The proposed presidential request by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Below 1001 delegates had voted the other hand, only nine, ten had to abstain. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The standing ovation lasting several minutes, which were initially due to their Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble lieβen, part of the three pan-European leanings of Finance openly no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The main idea of ​​the Chancellor bears - as well as the Antrage - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is &amp;quot;not less but more Europe.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &amp;quot;nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor, &amp;quot;the time for a breakthrough came in Europe&amp;quot; is. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could occur through the control of the European Union empowering modification of the Lisbon Treaty as regards the policy of the countries in the euro zone expressed, as it could, however, in the election of the president lead the European Commission based on general voting &amp;quot;to make Europe a face to &amp;quot;give. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> However, this is definitely one of the application proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Godfather. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly there is little likely that the 47 to agree quickly on this revolution: Large-Britain is hostile to the cause, and to know the managers of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The milestone has been laid. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Similarly, the delegates have an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously would result in a strengthening of the position of Germany with him. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> The calm on the climate within their party thoughtful Chancellor has, therefore, the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl reinforced. However, she no longer tries to win their conference at the expense of &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; or to the European countries in difficulties, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> Unless the request of the European importance of the &amp;quot;Franco-German friendship,&amp;quot; devotes a paragraph, calls Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not directly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Because it points out that Leipzig was two centuries ago in the center of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, one of the supremely humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army. </seg>

<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 November arriving in Bordeaux to go to a family allowance fund and a speech about that - since 2007 recurring - theme of struggle against social fraud and economic dependence on the state to make. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> To accompany the attack that originates from the desire to subject the economy in a hardness test, on the other hand, however, is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker absenteeism. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, with household economic goals: the government is targeting the launch of a fourth day leave before consideration of a sick leave among workers in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In German well, this means that a sick employee would lose without specific authorization from the company to pay for four days, so therefore at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A Maβnahme, quoted by the daily &amp;quot;Les Echos&amp;quot; threatens to evoke anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And the other with a more symbolic character Maβnahme would go along: the state officials to give an uncoated waiting period in case of illness (so far there is to it, in contrast to the three waiting days in the private sector, no waiting period). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Meanwhile, these issues are under discussion, the majority also sparked anew the issue of fraud, is being targeted at the time of absence from work related abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> &amp;quot;Checks will be much more important, and beyond these rückzuvergüten, if required,&amp;quot; warned Xavier Bertrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the impact of this release regarding the reality of fraud in the areas of health messages out of proportion a little. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is, in fact, since 2002 the subject of constant observation, as well as political campaigns, which have borne the most fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Let us, however, initially at the national numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the National Health Insurance CNAM in 2006 were paid more than 237 million euros days severance pay. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> Pursuant to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health presented the daily settlements in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros dar. 5% of health spending </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount fell about 46% of maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% concerning sick leave, witch means 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And therefore, 2.5% health care spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In 2010 the French against the 17.8 days in 2009 were granted on average, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group only 14.5 sick days. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average of some differences glossed over: another was, in 2007 by Monster.com, site for career planning, publishing, pointed out that 75% of the 40th 000 respondents, French employees stated that they had taken no sick days only. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another, recorded this time by the health insurance study makes clear that 37% of sick days were in 2010, of shorter duration than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% higher. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared with its European neighbors, the French workers tend not to work more than elsewhere disability. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> One in 2010 by two researchers from the French, governmental Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) longitudinal study showed that between 1994 and 2001 overall absence rate (illness or justified otherwise) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20 % and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The sick leave fraud is a very small proportion in terms of moonlighting dar. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Regarding the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002, brings with it, that there is systmatische controls on sick leave in excess of 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, the CNAM (public education for education and training of technicians and engineers) found less than 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285 000 of realized short-term sick leave, witch means in 37 050 cases of &amp;quot;unfair or too long&amp;quot; were. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the cases systematically controlled sick leave of more than 45 days duration were counted under 1.2 million 11% of &amp;quot;non-conformist or unjustifiable&amp;quot; cases, witch means 132,000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Altogether, this makes 169 000 &amp;quot;unjustified&amp;quot; attacks on millions of workers who have made a sick leave claim. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A number that represents only a weak Ausmaβ compared, for example those of the black economy. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a July released property report with regard to this question, this is 9 to 15 billion euros in tax loss of profits is per year, or more than the total cost of daily allowances, and so much more than the defraudation at last. </seg>

<seg id="2519"> Euthanasia and suicide should be legalized accompanied, according to a panel of experts </seg>
<seg id="2520"> The Canadians are living in denial of death, as appears from a report of the Royal Society of Canada </seg>
<seg id="2521"> The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians working together with regard to pain relief treatment for the best pain reliever to provide, and this is also going well on the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> The Canadian society lives in a negative attitude toward death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians can actually be one to talk to their doctors about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, where six experts were involved, which in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, are linked. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is, and on patients who are considered able to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> As a prelude, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent company EIU that had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe together. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada is here on the 10th Rank has placed the study noted that &amp;quot;death is the medical care in Canada produced a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians reported no access to painkillers, we may exercise by the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts. </seg>

<seg id="2530"> Viewed from across the country establish the rate of 86% of hospital deaths that occurred in Quebec is the highest. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> In the sensitive issue regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide are the authors of the report conclusions to the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert to want to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide are oppositely directed. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> Are now but according to experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries inspected, have their approach to euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, so the practical implementation of euthanasia or assisted suicide of incompetent or non-consenting persons would entail. </seg>

<seg id="2540"> As for maintenance or adjustment of the means for patients is to situation is less clear, the author of the report. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> Also near this place in their list of recommendations that should be specified in the Penal Code, that the withdrawal of funds for a legal opposition had been submitted should not be considered as criminal. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> The expert panel urges, moreover, that the health care professionals should be trained in the task to respect the cessation of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of criminal prosecution to have. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians working together with regard to analgesic treatment in order to provide the best pain reliever available, and this is also going well on the cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> Finally, the committee calls regarding the Canadian back in the institutions of health care widely applied means to relieve pain or lebensabschlieβender measures that could drag them to at least consider, as they nor euthanasia were used to reduce physical pain, they referred to the same procedures . </seg>

<seg id="2676"> Energy Policy: </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Facts should prevail over dogma </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Is there a topic that is not based on short-term considerations or because of emotions must be dealt with, then this is surely the energy policy. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power Measurments and the competitiveness of enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> It is reasonable to accept an election meeting on the occasion to reflect on this subject and about the role of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> The debate will only bear fruit if the totality of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> The French were to substantiate their opinions on objective facts and rational data. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Although 7 billion people are on this planet, driving the demographic evolution of a doubling of electricity demand above 2050, should not have to give a huge proportion of people on a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> At the same time you have to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources to produce electricity can remain stable, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a vanished from the environmental debate topic, in order to fight against climate malpractice. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> The accident of Fukushima changed any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Therefore, Germany remains sealed for its decision in isolation, to give up nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a viable replacement source substitution, even in Switzerland, the mere intention to build nuclear power plants, only the last generation. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few States have, however, continue their projects with determination. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> The United States has in turn decided to Fukushima, annexing their park another unit by taking the once abandoned after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Iceland operation. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Even if that is focused on renewable energy sources, German model sometimes portrayed as a model, so, however, contradicts the reality of the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="2691"> The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of a price increase of electricity prices, increased by the use of imported gas increased energy dependence on Russia in particular, caused by an increase in gas-and coal-fired power plants CO2 emissions. </seg>
<seg id="2692"> The totality of these effects is unpleasant are already being felt within a few months. </seg>
<seg id="2693"> The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> Denmark is a part of European leaders concerning wind energy, from which it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the largest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy, which links its CO2-emissions and its electricity prices will rise by 65% ​​and 50 % higher than the corresponding European average. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Thanks to the stability of our energy policy to pay our neighbors in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bill. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> As the price of energy is in the globalized economy is a key part of the competitiveness and a stable mortgage industry on national soil, have the French company because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Any significant reduction in respect of nuclear power would, therefore, a significant increase in energy prices lead to what the noble statements would be an illusion on the re-industrialization of our country and to defend the purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveys show that is a price that relate to large majority of French people is willing to pay as little as they can detect resistance to the principle of this energy source. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Let us recall that the energy policy of our country has made it an industry with 125.00 and 410.000 direct jobs induced build. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Because of its strong export character brings a plethora of specialized small and medium enterprises on the international markets and turning them into creators of countless jobs. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> France should take the decision to phase out nuclear power, which a Groβteil would fall victim to these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and exports of nuclear energy would shrink more and more. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> Which one would hire an electrician to function designed EPR at sixty years, if the demise of its producers is inevitable? </seg>
<seg id="2703"> To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no more a work of the devil as a panacea for the generation of electricity. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> Developed by the company, Areva, low-CO2 solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> The highest level of security must be maintained for the nuclear power is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> In France we have a security authority, the uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction is carried out in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> Their work teams that have made a name for their professionalism are of the idea just too obsessed with security. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> Within 50 years the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> Only one, in Three Mile Iceland, has occurred under normal operating conditions, it was without consequences for humans and the environment. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> In the drama of Chernobyl reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error has been evoked. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters unprecedented magnitude was caused, which caused the deaths of several thousand people. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> The nuclear industry will also draw lessons from this accident, as she had done previous to the two. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German designers and operators of nuclear power plants, represents the EPR is a design that makes it resistant to such phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> Since it is considered among electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, would be a freeze in Flamanville a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by them could be free rein to seize the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best Energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate that is determined as economic, social and financial situation of our country. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Guided by Nicolas Sarkozy, immigration policy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative organs because of the numbers subject to policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a &amp;quot;state of human rights&amp;quot;, as had France itself entitled. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently, the students directed against foreign harassment by the authorities, the newsreels had coined the Home Secretary had casually (see Libération, 23 May) announced that France &amp;quot;no talent, masons and waiters from abroad was necessary.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> On this subject two countries have a broad consensus between right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> From the right side of the sound of Jacques Chirac was struck, which had declared in 1976 that &amp;quot;are likely to represent 900 000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, not a problem for a country,&amp;quot; from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990, France &amp;quot;could not hold the entire world poverty.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The only difference is the degree of generosity </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of invasion by hordes of Polish national soil plumber was divided in 2005, both from right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden to the economy and French society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the degree of generosity that is to admit the immigrants to willing. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande, is limited in its program to banalities, indicating co-development allow it to solve our &amp;quot;immigration problem&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This conception of immigration as a burden, a problem may possibly affect the elections, but it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Like us, the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work realize that the latest findings concerning sums of Immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) among the specialists, a broad consensus exists regarding the positive influence of the immigrant tide of economic growth, wages and employment in host countries. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The limiting immigration would undermine the growth and harm the labor market situation. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears over the impact of migrants is based on the idea that this threatens the local workforce, especially the less qualified to substitute, by putting pressure on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much better than they did as the native laborers, because they carry schwerpunktmäβig occupations in sectors that are underutilized job technically. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low-skilled immigrants to work in sectors that local laborers little irritating, the more skilled immigrants to work in the most dynamic sectors in which the training is not the labor supply adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive wage effect </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between natives and immigrants also causes a positive effect of the influx of immigrants on wages and domestic employment situation. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri is calculated in this way that a 1% increase of the immigrant tide miteinbezogene a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% is bringing about. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this without considering the fact that the immigrants brought in by the idea of ​​the diversity of creation and economic growth is conducive (high proportion of naturalized immigrants in American Nobel Prize winners, were Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo founded by immigrants). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Migrants also contribute to the social systems in net, in the European countries on average at a height of about 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years, immigrating to Germany person in the state budget through its average lifetime net contribution (revenue minus expenses) by introducing some 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to be the start of his mandate, the lack of intersections &amp;quot;with teeth&amp;quot; to bring about. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> This said teeth, which should deter the immigrants achieved, however, exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has invented democracy, is now, to think through the European democracy </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a precious commodity, is also a fragile commodity. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The European continent should be able to even remember who it was invented in Athens for more than two thousand years the whole of the 20th Century about the tragedies of World War II, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also in Franco&amp;#39;s Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Greece had the Supreme can endure. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some had probably thought it was sufficient to exercise the voting rights, and indeed to see the most direct way possible, a triumph for democracy and for all of their enemies. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> It is known since Napoleon &amp;quot;the Little&amp;quot; that acted it is a feature of the mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy is, is this not a sufficient condition, and can just as easily become &amp;quot;an instrument of repression&amp;quot;, as it was the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and foremost political and democratic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The change of attitude of the Greek true-false referendum would in this respect, revealing character had twice: once to the need for a powerful return of the policy, on the other side, but also those of the unsettling feeling of the impossibility of its inappropriateness. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be considered obsolete. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that target the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, not in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain in order to push for a national success of the referendum, which was organized in response to the needs and in reverse order. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A free ticket for the European autocrat or a jump blindfolded into the emptiness of the Nationalist retreat: A fabulous choice for the citizens! </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want to cleaver, but a collective task, from full right to clarify and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at a European level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know the rest no longer to end where the bullet - there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe, which bows to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from his swoon, and his lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is Europe that is humiliated on an international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> It is concerned about transfer of sovereignty to Europe - this is Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every one of his affiliated nations. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is to return the sovereignty of the people, the leadership of the European project to indicate the source. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is situated on the whole, if the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free himself from the markets and a future through investments can initiate. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis, decisions at the European level as a condition that can not be made without totally democratic Legality, without us, certainly to lead to disaster. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought a long time was urging everyone today to the European economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> I agree. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But this is without political integration and strengthening of democracy - as envisaged by the citizens - imagine would be a folly again and another dead end. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We must take a new step in European integration us. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> To create in the Republic of France, it took the fact to &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; Republicans. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The interests of the revolution could not afford enough alone here. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This teaching remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> We need to form a more integrated Europe on an economic level. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be achieved by creating a politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> We Europeans need to create Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> &amp;quot;Contactless&amp;quot; smart cards are becoming common </seg>
<seg id="2773"> The World Fair for smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude its doors. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> The year 2011 was, according to the really smart € with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (cash cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> The tragendste segment here is the contactless technology, the payments on public transport or payment of purchases made possible by simply holding the card to a reader. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> Compared with a year earlier sold 320 million should this year 460 million contactless smart cards are sold worldwide! </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Its market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards) represent. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> Europe wins in terms of contactless payments to the ground, after a long time the Asia-Pacific region has lagged behind. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals to accept this. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> In France, the beginnings were modest: only 400 000 contactless Visa cards were distributed. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The supermarkets, however, make steam. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Carrefour has therefore issued this year, 2.5 million passport contactless MasterCards. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> In order to move towards higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> &amp;quot;Have two big French financial institutions are obliged to hand over their customers systematically in future bank cards, which are equipped with a contactless chip,&amp;quot; announces Nébouy Gérard, CEO of Visa Europe, France. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Banks test payment by mobile phone </seg>
<seg id="2786"> This is only a first step on the way to the payment of the future: the mobile phone. </seg>

<seg id="2800"> &amp;quot;The way to proceed with the two organizations and the relationship of intelligence indicate a clear cooperation,&amp;quot; he said without going into further detail. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Paris seems to do a similar analysis. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> The investigation into last January which had taken place in Niger kidnapping of two French ports brought to light. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> They should have been on the following day at the same time as several of their captors at a getöten by French special forces carried out operations in a restaurant in Niamey Aqmi kidnapped by followers of Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory. </seg>

<seg id="2807"> According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are especially interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time period in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, the other leads to a man , regarded as the Aqmi and the sect to be related. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> &amp;quot;This is progress, but you have to wait for clearer evidence certainly before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem&amp;quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2839"> He had called for a full-blown, but constructive exchange of ideas with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama). </seg>
<seg id="2840"> But Huntsman is not heard, since he stagnated in the depths of public opinion polls. </seg>

<seg id="2858"> Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe </seg>
<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> It will supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>
<seg id="2861"> The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with flying colors. </seg>
<seg id="2862"> About 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast with orchestral sound and gourmet buffet at the inauguration attended the new gas pipeline Nord Stream will link Russia and Germany under the sea directly with each other. </seg>
<seg id="2863"> The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte of the Netherlands have symbolically turned together the control of the valve, which carries Russian gas to Western European network. </seg>
<seg id="2864"> The new gas pipeline will be 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas per year extra provided by a first pipeline of 1,224 kilometers, connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2865"> A second pipeline, a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is permitted to be completed by the end 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2866"> And it already makes the eventuality of building a third line echoes to track itself. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> Gazprom has for the timely and accurate completion of this huge building like a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream pipeline will provide gas supply that is a direct to Germany, whilst avoiding any pipeline route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For this reason, these two countries lose some of their power: for them it is now difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close the entrance to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, involved in most of the debate was not shied away compared to the Nord Stream pipeline with a &amp;quot;new German-Soviet Pact,&amp;quot; in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the issue is politically sensitive The curative. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has won the endorsement of the Russian project an even higher degree of security. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But at the expense of a weakening of European energy, because the project has made a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has made it ready in less than five years, his vision have a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, the strong gas consumptions and go their gas reserves are running low, to enforce. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> &amp;quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way,&amp;quot; Francois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by pointing out to what extent the groβen gas contracts by political and economic side are important. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> All this in the broad smile of Lubmin numerous representatives in Gazprom&amp;#39;s managers explained in terms of gas supply. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> The underwater cable is made of steel with concrete coating, they should protect them from ship anchors. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> It rests on the seabed at 200 m depth. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> Had to be avoided when it was built during the Second World War minefields dating. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &amp;quot;Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution&amp;quot;, was announced by Jens Mueller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> HOT STUFF had strengthened measures designed to protect the fauna and flora to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The line is a long line of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is cut along the entire length by anything: neither valves nor maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> A control was provided platform off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained, as the Swedes were a little eager, a Russian state company settle on a permanent manner at the level of their coasts to see. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> &amp;quot;In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute,&amp;quot; specified Jens Mueller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak in the escape of gas transmission, gas located so into the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> This case is considered by the designers but only unlikely, since the Schweiβnähte was estimated to be from a leak resistance per 100,000 years. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot that is controlled for purposes of external observation from a ship, as well as a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It has the form of a cigar, miβt one meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and propelled by the gas pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three full days of travel through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the unit provides accurate information on his arrival on possible deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty long years, without having the slightest repair must be submitted. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This is 200 bar at the access control, 100 in cash at the exit point. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have joined forces to realize this project. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The wiring remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Furthermore, here are the German companies E.ON and BASF&amp;#39;s affiliated (according to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (both 9%). </seg>
<seg id="2898"> These five companies have formed a grouping calling itself the North Stream and charged with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> It is headquartered in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> Gazprom has subsequently leased the entire capacity of the society of its gas transport, on Twenty-year renewable contract. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> &amp;quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter How much do the real amount of gas transporting fails,&amp;quot; specified Jens Mueller. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> The financing of the gas pipeline construction has been secured for 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> The total labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion € for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> For GDF Suez was the total investment, for example, 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> The minority shareholders are, however gewiβ to recoup their expenses back, because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability. </seg>
<seg id="2906"> The gas transmission occurs on a sandy, pine-forested shoreline revealed in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> The 4.5 meter high gate valves form the gas outlet. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> Since last Tuesday of the terminal with one million cubic meters of Russian gas supplies will elapsing per hour. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> Moleskine is a brand notebook. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> By an Italian company about fifteen years ago launched Moleskine would like to give the letter back new style. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> It has an air of adventure, with candlelight and spent hours writing delivered. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> The Notebook by Moleskine is easily recognizable with his black, rectangular cover, his rubber band, the eggshell-colored pages, such as aging throughout time. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> The Moleskine notebook as we know it today, however, emerged in 1997. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided its time to bring it a distinguished design notebook on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Maria Sebregondi, then technical advisor to the company, is charged with the launch of the new product. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> The notebook was called by a traditional production techniques, Mole skin (mole skin) inspired, which means a Baumwollack used for example for covers of upholstered benches. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> This type of notebook was asked by writers and travelers very much. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> &amp;quot;Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject revive, who was until the 20th century avant-garde artist as an icon,&amp;quot; said Maria Sebregondi, now brand managers at Modo Modo. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> The success occurs. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> Between 2006 and 2010 sales increase by 26% and establish themselves with sales of 12.7 million units. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> This is a far cry from the usual production of the first years in which only 3000 notebooks are designed. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is executed in 70 countries, from France to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> It is difficult to prepare a composite sketch of the buyer, since the notebook business as well as enthusiastic students and professionals. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> Moleskine has the image of a cosmopolitan, cultured and open to spiritual clients. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> The small Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet sites like Fnac, in small boutiques in the city center and knows how to assert his identity. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> &amp;quot;We are the spirit of the times and followed his new stationery, which consists despite the boom in e-mails,&amp;quot; said Maria Sebregondi. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand exposure called &amp;quot;Detour (detour)&amp;quot; was launched, exhibiting the artists and architects in their own notebooks. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> In August, the company introduced during the film festival in Locarno also a cover with a leopard pattern on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Moleskine has benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and was able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases ... The brand has the full range of products. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> A success, the envy brings on the scene: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo from SG Capital Europe Fund investment, today&amp;#39;s Syntegra Capital was acquired, and struck up a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers working in such good shape? </seg>
<seg id="2935"> About 19% of disabled people are to find a job. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Today begins the &amp;quot;15th week of work for the disabled&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> Despite a purposeful public policy that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average mean value: 19% versus 9% of the total population Arbeitlosigkeit. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Discouraging? </seg>
<seg id="2939"> &amp;quot;No, it says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the&amp;quot; Week of work for the disabled &amp;quot;align.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2940"> &amp;quot;The results achieved within fifteen years, progress has been substantial.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2941"> &amp;quot;At that time the unemployment rate is not twice but three times as high.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2942"> &amp;quot;Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount to do.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2943"> It must be said, however, that for the unemployed with disabilities continue to survive numerous obstacles before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> More often it hits the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="2945"> They have a low skill level: 80% of them have no school and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities under the 2.3 million students in higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Finally, the long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities compared to 38% in the overall average. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> In short, there are so many criteria that are difficult to re-start work, and &amp;quot;form the core of the problem&amp;quot; that the said Christian grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an organization formed in 1992, the company is assisting to recruit disabled workers. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> So much material on the brakes. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> Remains the unspoken, the attitudes, which, although of course, but nevertheless continued to develop slowly. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> One was in April of the association IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have &amp;quot;a weak level of knowledge about disabilities,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;over-represented&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually Mind poor ones.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2951"> Result that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987 is to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> The latter, referred from 2008 numbers originating at a ratio of 2.6%. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> &amp;quot;We are now at around 3%,&amp;quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is mandated to collect contributions from companies who violate this law. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> Proof: The number &amp;quot;fees paid&amp;quot; permanent establishment has been reduced as the sum of the amounts paid in 2007-2011, namely zahlenmäβig of 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
<seg id="2955"> &amp;quot;The 2005 law provides that premium increases, creating a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2956"> &amp;quot;But it also brings a real improvement in knowledge particularly in the groβen business groups expressed.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2957"> According to the Ministry of Labour employ only 59% of premises 20-49 employees, disabled workers, businesses with 100 to 199 employees and 82% contrast. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Hazard: &amp;quot;How lucky&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Even before the &amp;quot;Blue Tuesday nights (20:45 clock) defied, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had their pleasure that they brought the friendly match, not conceal. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> It would be too much to claim that there was a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks volumes symbolic. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Side by side on the podium of the spectators were seated George Stade de France and Eden Hazard Leekens well and happy to make peace. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> Five months after the spirited gesture of his player&amp;#39;s attack against Turkey, the Belgian national team coach had nothing but praise harvested about his person. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> &amp;quot;I am very satisfied with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &amp;quot;I want to look forward,&amp;quot; the native of Lille, in turn assured. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> As for the contrast between his statement in club and national team, &amp;quot;It is a unity that justifies everything.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2966"> &amp;quot;In Lille I am throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2967"> &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s time for me to go to the Start.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2968"> Hazard is coming to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France, at last, &amp;quot;to shine&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Without fail, however, to the grade of &amp;quot;pleasure&amp;quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> The French national team he cheered since the age of 7 years, his victorious campaigns he led between 1998 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> &amp;quot;I was always supported,&amp;quot; he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This inevitably contributes to significant improvements in the &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; nature of this encounter even more. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> So much in advance: &amp;quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) it will be,&amp;quot; he recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re just crossed my path.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &amp;quot;Playing against them may mean groβes luck!&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Leekens left his hand with kindness &amp;quot;pride&amp;quot; which suggests. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> &amp;quot;The pride of being a gala match&amp;quot; unsubscribe. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> &amp;quot;Pride&amp;quot; also - in his capacity as a &amp;quot;neighbor&amp;quot; - to confirm that France &amp;quot;has become a team at a very high level,&amp;quot; and little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &amp;quot;Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,&amp;quot; he said enthusiastically. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championships, so the technician does very well with the plane of the Blue (the French national team) share ... namely to Brazil in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> &amp;quot;We come out small Belgian Large Cap,&amp;quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &amp;quot;We are going to plan a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2983"> &amp;quot;You will notice in the upcoming games.&amp;quot; The game against France involved. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Portugal very confident </seg>
<seg id="2985"> The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with a worldwide optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> In the first leg of the two teams had missed the sobriety. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> &amp;quot;At the end of his 90 minutes we are a happy team and above all a Happy Land.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2988"> Paulo Bento sees already in Poland and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> For him it is not the slightest hint of doubt that &amp;quot;La Seleccao,&amp;quot; his national team for which he was responsible for September 2010, qualify for Euro 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> For Portugal, this means, in fact, only 90 minutes bliss. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an enemy, namely Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> In view of the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Portugal clearly dominated over more than an hour the game, but the team was unable to impose the all-important matter of the stamp that the pressure would have taken away from her. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> &amp;quot;This is a good result, but this involves some risk, because we have made no away goals.&amp;quot; </seg>
<seg id="2995"> Home, however, in their bright radiant with Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident in front of an audience that would also heiβ be on the game by strike, even if the game was, of course, billed as &amp;quot;very tight,&amp;quot; said the optimistic, however, clear-sighted Bento. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> &amp;quot;We expect a very close match, but are entirely convinced that we can gain the upper hand,&amp;quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> &amp;quot;We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European&amp;quot; relativized, however, the successor to Carlos Queiroz. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The draw on Friday the Portuguese forces in Bosnia to achieve a goal and win. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> A draw may be the Bosnians, who also have a goal necessary to meet already. </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &amp;quot;This is a good result, but this involves some risk, because we have made no away goal,&amp;quot; Bento regrets. </seg>
