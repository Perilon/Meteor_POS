<seg id="20"> Seen in this light, it is rather astonishing that the Muslim fighters at all of the infidels dogs help. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In their defence, may well serve only the fact that the air strikes by NATO not by any General from America, but by Allah even led the omnipotence after every successful hit was praised. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The winner in Libya? the West is not one of them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We took in only in a gun battle, served the interests of Islam and our politicians were in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit. </seg>

<seg id="78"> More than a third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9% of all pupils and 5% of all children are overweight. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Recent opinion polls - obese children come mostly from families with ungesundem lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="80"> So once again, how important it is for the development of a healthy people the milieu in which it grows up and the examples that surrounded him. </seg>

<seg id="82"> More than 19 percent of overweight children, on the eve of the Aufklärungsaktion under the slogan “ obesity is not a coincidence ” for chips for dinner. </seg>
<seg id="83"> In families with Dickerchen include sport is not just to the Lieblingsbeschäftigungen, but also the majority of today &apos;s students, only 15 percent said that their parents are at least once a week on time for active movement. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Survey of 900 children </seg>
<seg id="85"> The survey found last year against the end of the academic year, were almost 900 children from schools across the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="86"> This was the second year the action “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” by the general insurance company and the society Unilever is supported. </seg>
<seg id="87"> To date, the project more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8. classes. </seg>
<seg id="88"> Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity are responsible. </seg>
<seg id="89"> “ Only the half of children, for example, five times a day, in the mode of breakfast - second breakfast, lunch - Vesper - to eat for dinner, one of the main elements of a healthy diet, ” is one of the survey results. </seg>
<seg id="90"> No breakfast and the sausages for dinner </seg>
<seg id="91"> Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular Frühstückszeit the family, important for the healthy development of a child. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In the Czech Republic frühstücken but only 23 percent of the families of the students. </seg>
<seg id="93"> And, in most families breakfast alone. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The worst was the fact that in every tenth family is not eating any breakfast. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Breakfast is the foundation stone of the day - to - day healthy diet. </seg>
<seg id="96"> The Umfragetest brought to, among other things, the day that the families of overweight children more frequently to unhealthy chips consumed. </seg>
<seg id="97"> And nearly everyone, with no regard to weight - drink every day sweetened soft drinks (70%) </seg>
<seg id="98"> While driving more than 40 per cent of children sport, but fewer than half of their parents are doing this - just 15 percent. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Just think your own menu together </seg>
<seg id="100"> Another part of the poll, made it possible for selected children (204 boys and girls from 172 13 schools), from opportunities offered after appetites and believe their own menu together. </seg>
<seg id="101"> “ What czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a long way from the ideal of a healthy diet. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Among their favourite foods were many Mehlspeisen Fleischgerichte, and, of course, Süßspeisen. </seg>
<seg id="103"> “ Alarmierend is above all the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks ”, will be in the final report on the survey highlights. </seg>
<seg id="104"> At lunch, the main course, triumphed pasta just before poultry. </seg>
<seg id="105"> Pulses, liked the children almost not at all and the popularity of fish and Gemüsegerichten as lunch was very low. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Hinkehr on health </seg>
<seg id="107"> At the same time, the survey showed, however, that the children are willing to change their eating habits, if it is right for information. </seg>
<seg id="108"> “ In the control group of the Umfragebeteiligten, the questionnaire following the conclusion of the aufklärenden lecture “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” filling out was, in many cases, a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy eating there, ” is in the results of the project. </seg>
<seg id="109"> For example, this was evident in the sweet Limos, where many children began to ordinary water to give priority. </seg>
<seg id="110"> The children crossed in the questionnaire, more often chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less dumpling or sweet food to eat. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Experts say a Stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
<seg id="112"> In the initial article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit of gemeckert that a little bit too much food, for a start. </seg>
<seg id="113"> As anticipated, I do not have the slightest of what is to come. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of troubled characters and a seminar on how the “ place ”. </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is worse to come. </seg>
<seg id="116"> The closer examination, so more information and practical challenges before us. </seg>
<seg id="117"> But even if the course each on Saturdays and Sunday, he is still full. </seg>
<seg id="118"> This time, we debated with director exists (on the course, not a single man part), as a woman, not the ideal proportionierte figure. </seg>
<seg id="119"> And that is still the most of us. </seg>
<seg id="120"> The first is too short a neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is up to the Stylisten, broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We also got tips, such as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - that is, with great from the waist up, wide and narrow their waist - hip nicely and figurbetont attracts without too provocative. </seg>
<seg id="123"> If, for example, the difference between their waist and Hüften is so great that the rock or the pair of trousers really do not fit, you should at least a little bit to tailor - make their groups. </seg>
<seg id="124"> The you will certainly not regret, because well - based clothing is simply unaffordable. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In such a tailor - made Rock you feel are much better than in a “ off the, the full of high - and, in the absteht verrutscht their waist, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, allow clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung. </seg>
<seg id="127"> In this lot of information and Figurtypen, I am pleased that a whole week I have time, I thoroughly over. </seg>
<seg id="128"> And yet, I fear that, given the homework assigned to it almost impossible to achieve. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Each of the Kursteilnehmerinnen received a Promi allocated, for which it is fitting attire and come up with to - Tagesbekleidung Abendrobe. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Should the current appearance, Modestil of the stars and the Figurtyp account. </seg>
<seg id="131"> I should Miranda Kerr “ attract ” that you possibly from the campaign Victoria &apos;s secret. </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the heart of juble I, as it is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, the last time well the hundred kilos of increased (okay, this is a bit of an exaggeration), or even the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
<seg id="133"> The clothes are we from ausschneiden magazines or on the Internet, and then printed grafisch. </seg>
<seg id="134"> In the “ Moodboard ”, as the whole result is to then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design. </seg>
<seg id="135"> It is very important, even on the side of the graphic Stylings. </seg>
<seg id="136"> The Stylist, the models are not only physically, but also creates the so - called product side in the journal (after specific target, for example, trend - handbags, coats, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="137"> It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="138"> But the only on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="139"> This means that a Stylist must have a good view. </seg>
<seg id="140"> With the information about Figurentypen angefüllte Samstagsvortrag, three visitors from the seasoned industry: </seg>
<seg id="141"> By Jan Stylisten Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the Modefotograf Ben Renč. </seg>
<seg id="142"> Jakub reminded us that fashion is the illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id="143"> And eingeschickter Stylist can with a single Bekleidungsstück in a very different way to work. </seg>
<seg id="144"> The magic word means variability. </seg>
<seg id="145"> You can, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the wear jeans, a T - shirt or coat, you can have it but also on the naked body, Absatzschuhe to attract it as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is enough, the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and immediately, the whole look very different. </seg>
<seg id="147"> “ To play with, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Most came to me but the Council to be the following: “ first of all you have to know the rules of perfect. ” </seg>
<seg id="149"> “ Only then you can violate them, ” said Jakub. </seg>
<seg id="150"> At last, is clear to me why we all these theories pauken must what to do with what can combine and why, even if, in Modejournalen often quite another to see. </seg>
<seg id="151"> By Modeschauen. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that a Stylist much more Bekleidungsvarianten have prepared, as it will finally be photographed. </seg>
<seg id="153"> So you have for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) to be prepared, at least 15 to stylen. </seg>
<seg id="154"> And also that the clothing the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="155"> With all that are going to have to get the attire. </seg>
<seg id="156"> That image and sometimes Styl half the success, swiping us Jan Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="157"> You only need to be even Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing a world star with respect. </seg>
<seg id="158"> In the Czech Republic, the services of a Stylisten more reserved. </seg>
<seg id="159"> Even celebrities is often a waste of money for (the main thing is that I, as I am is a secondary issue). </seg>
<seg id="160"> And if one of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size sport, as he or she really needs. </seg>
<seg id="161"> It will then be only googlen with security to note that the tabloid writes, the corresponding Promi have again or declined, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to not to believe that a Stylist only to the fashion to focus on and then the clothes “ assemble needs. ” </seg>
<seg id="163"> In his work he needs, in particular, with the people communicate, which he stylt and it must be a skilled psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="164"> People assess without, and to please his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="165"> “ If we have any manager, their Kleiderschrank to sift through and beautiful pieces to supplement, then it does not eliminate the whole a cupboard and say, my God, this is terrible. ” </seg>
<seg id="166"> “ At least a few worthy things on which they recommend what you can, ” says Mario. </seg>
<seg id="167"> He showed us specifically as a so - called “ Platztasche must contain. ” </seg>
<seg id="168"> In other words, so a bag at the their waist zuknöpft and in which all the necessary Proprietäten in. </seg>
<seg id="169"> No such clear terms, such as the gap, Abroller Haareentfernen Sicherheitsnadeln or does it contain such Utensilien, such as a Nylonfaden (helping the Stylist the photography of products such as handbags or hats from), specific clips to the back of the clothing gerafft will, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are prohibited, so that the material does not break down) and, of course, Nähzeug. </seg>
<seg id="170"> So that we not only have to listen to, but also something virtually can try, we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes. </seg>
<seg id="171"> The photography studio, where the floor is, it can damage the Schuhsohle, much less the outside. </seg>
<seg id="172"> Us o klebten and klebten we … </seg>
<seg id="173"> With the gap, we must not even affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged. </seg>
<seg id="174"> So you have really sent. </seg>
<seg id="175"> Mario delighted me by my “ creation ” without restrictions praised. </seg>
<seg id="176"> The skill is not just my strength. </seg>
<seg id="177"> All of this was just the fraction of what we in the second weekend - Fortsetzungskurs to be told. </seg>
<seg id="178"> One thing is I have since become clear - the Styling at a professional level, is not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="179"> V Need for speed: “ the run ” - the illegal race across America </seg>
<seg id="180"> Recession </seg>
<seg id="181"> Originally, careless driving has been hit by a series of entirely preventable, dilettantischer mistake to Routinefahrt to Frühschicht. </seg>
<seg id="182"> It managed to ambitions in large part to meet, but what is the point if no one seems to want a bit more to do. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Even before he came to the Ladentische, part of the new with the subtitle “ the run high expectations. ” </seg>
<seg id="184"> He promised, but the already bejahrte Spieleserie “ Need for speed ” back in a new dimension to delay in the spielbaren Demonstrationsbeispielen he seemed really not only one of many action - Rennspielen. </seg>
<seg id="185"> We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist of the car is rising and will continue on foot. </seg>
<seg id="186"> But as it was in NFS is so accustomed to, in essence, is a lot different than it had expected. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Sure, there are potentially very decent Arkade - race, but on the whole, the game by some unnecessary mistakes diminished in this series are already more or less for a few years to have a presence there. </seg>
<seg id="188"> So there are really no more mistakes, but rather evidence of a in principle incomprehensible laziness of the Spieleentwickler. </seg>
<seg id="189"> The adventure begins very well. </seg>
<seg id="190"> For now, it will be in the history of introduced, whose main character Jack personal nature of certain problems; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America. </seg>
<seg id="191"> In San Francisco, on the west coast, will it get steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York to be. </seg>
<seg id="192"> The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements. </seg>
<seg id="193"> The entire route is in ten stages and in more than 50 individual race divided. </seg>
<seg id="194"> This means that every race at another route, and that the various stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu. </seg>
<seg id="195"> It has no moment the impression that game is always the same. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Some areas are still very nicely, although the technical level of chart does not have the earlier parts of the series. </seg>
<seg id="197"> That is not something I get too excited about. </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the journey through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape wirk visually very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Now and again bring atypical elements of a bit of a change in the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="200"> In the desert, for example, is a surprise to the point of view of the desert storm cripples. </seg>
<seg id="201"> In the mountains, in turn, must be to watch your step, that is not an avalanche buried. </seg>
<seg id="202"> By the way are fairly well in a row the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="203"> Only a few, but they do. </seg>
<seg id="204"> For a while we tried, the required number of opponents to overtake (in principle a classic race), you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), it still expected a duel between a face - to - face with a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="205"> And there is also the police force that a blow the whole thing. </seg>
<seg id="206"> A novelty are passages in which Jack of the vehicle leaves. </seg>
<seg id="207"> It is more about certain interactive including animations, in which Jack before anyone escaping and where the players must help by it at the right moment, the right button. </seg>
<seg id="208"> So it is not complicated. </seg>
<seg id="209"> It is surprising, however, that it is in the game a lot less passages, as one would expect (actually the only three). </seg>
<seg id="210"> In the end, that is the thing is more likely to have the advantage, because as this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above to the elements that make the game to vary. </seg>
<seg id="211"> The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts. </seg>
<seg id="212"> That is to say, from today &apos;s point of view, is pulling out of the trees, on the other hand, you could not argue that it would be bad. </seg>
<seg id="213"> Anyone who seeks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="214"> But a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren Fahrmodell our supermarket will remain very well, although the competition could find better. </seg>
<seg id="215"> Until then, as far as all in good order. </seg>
<seg id="216"> Real problems, there are only after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="217"> In contrast to the Kollisionsmodell Fahrmodell is not O. K. </seg>
<seg id="218"> Of a game of this kind, it is hard to expect there to be complicated deformations and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea of how the car, then, is clearly not everything is in order. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Case in point: the close Überholen or Vorbeifahren of oncoming cars “ scratches ” it in some places in the other car only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but we went into a tailspin on wild performance. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Or the Karre to scrap metal. </seg>
<seg id="221"> Thanks to the Restart - system which is nothing more, from annoying it is ever - present. </seg>
<seg id="222"> The Restarts are so resolved: if you have destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference. </seg>
<seg id="223"> Only - in every race has only five Restarts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> When they are exhausted, everything is from square one.. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The Restarts are actually more of something like a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it is hard. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Sometimes does not help the Restart, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often to the same places. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Some curves, for example, in a very specific way, because otherwise if we simply do not. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Elsewhere, there is a list of the “ civilian ” cars always in the same configuration, regardless of whether you as a first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later. </seg>
<seg id="230"> This is particularly in situations annoying when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away, but until it gets to the cars are already in such a position that they get or delay. </seg>
<seg id="231"> And it is no matter when they arrive, everything is designed to have this situation to always close to your nose. </seg>
<seg id="232"> The opposing parties have other benefits. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Throughout the game, there are a few places where you always in the same place from the same opponents will be overtaken again regardless of the time. </seg>
<seg id="234"> On Verrücktesten, this is the end of the game to the long bridge, one in the head. </seg>
<seg id="235"> The Kontrahent a must here seem to come hell or overtake. </seg>
<seg id="236"> And if he then had a is, then that is a, of course, the point of view, so that they initially by car a couple of times in Klump drive. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Clearly, you want the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clearly that they quickly the pleasure the game spoiled. </seg>
<seg id="238"> And that is a shame, because, in spite of a simpler Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and at times so aktionsgeladen that they no longer know, where one of the head. </seg>
<seg id="239"> And in principle, regardless of what “ guilty ” of it is - the concept with 50 unique routes, the organisation of the race in a way that no boredom, pay, or something else … </seg>
<seg id="240"> A far - fetched idea is also the Wagenwechsel during the race. </seg>
<seg id="241"> We must filling stations on the road not overlook the fact that just because you cannot change the car, even though in most cases the car enough that it is. </seg>
<seg id="242"> The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="243"> The sports cars are good for the urban areas, the strong american brand for the precise motorways and exotic super sports car for the technical journeys, for example, to the Serpentinen in the mountains. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Hand in hand with the way Spielgeschichte is also the tasks - mode (challenges) - the race in the individual localities, which is in the history of it. </seg>
<seg id="245"> There is not only medals, but also own Erfahrungspunkte for the win, which together for the tasks (challenges) and history. </seg>
<seg id="246"> In order to enhance the Fahrerniveau, have different open: the car started to the Backgrounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is, at the same time as the online role Autolog, among other things, the own achieved results compare with those of other players and also for further collective functions. </seg>
<seg id="248"> A further incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story. </seg>
<seg id="249"> Here it is: the car in an underground tunnel (I), where it was in the dark on the track for boils (say). </seg>
<seg id="250"> On the Tacho look paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h (I), but there is at once from behind a metro and drives a hard - line to scrap metal. </seg>
<seg id="251"> In our editorial we will probably still argue for a long time about whether this was a Blackout of Spielgestalter, or whether the authors to be so stupid. </seg>
<seg id="252"> The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression that, in most cases, appealing and here and there, even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Even more galling is that some of the exciting moments Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatic. </seg>
<seg id="254"> That is particularly the accidents with greater number of concerned, where a continuous FPS not of any good. </seg>
<seg id="255"> As far as the Tonwiedergabe is O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache. </seg>
<seg id="256"> In an effort to such a broad range of possible as more young audience, was a “ Soundtrack lá each of something ” - but who is buying such a game because of the music? </seg>
<seg id="257"> The overall impression of Need for speed: the run? the feelings are more mixed. </seg>
<seg id="258"> When the game not by these totally unnecessary mistakes would diminish if we had with the held conviction able to claim that the run the best piece of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="259"> But in fact, the game somehow unfinished. </seg>
<seg id="260"> In a class for pleasure, but we must be prepared for this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye. </seg>

<seg id="278"> “ The Lisbon Treaty, the balance between the various institutions felt from the order. ” </seg>
<seg id="279"> I would not have expected that such a hard war flares. ” </seg>
<seg id="280"> “ There will be five to six years, until the dust settles and all with their new role have become used to be, ” began girl Milena Vicenová, the czech ambassador to the European Union, quite strongly their lecture at the law school. </seg>
<seg id="281"> How seriously it the motto “ understandable and openly about Europe ”, it has shown in the first part of their lecture, in which it was able to the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that some of his editor, the faculty of the Karlsuniversität therefore have envy. </seg>
<seg id="282"> Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy. </seg>
<seg id="283"> “ Initially, according to criticism that it is too quietly - a grey official who is such a role not up, but I have to say that it has all the short, how well it is the issue. </seg>
<seg id="284"> “ He is a person of the 27 member states, it will listen patiently, communicate with and the particularly clear idea of, as it is with the EU is to continue. </seg>
<seg id="285"> The new position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the answer to the question: who is the really - the European Union? what number should I call? ”, in other words, as an important step to agreement and better visibility of the EU &apos;s policy towards states, such as China and India. </seg>
<seg id="286"> No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban </seg>
<seg id="287"> Mrs Vicenová dedicating the agenda, in accordance with the European Union, and lives in the near future to live. </seg>
<seg id="288"> The czech presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success. </seg>
<seg id="289"> The Czechs had the financial crisis and the faltering and gas crisis summits for the Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="290"> The fall of the government during the presidency describing it as a great Negativum, the image of the Czech Republic much damage. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In the words of the ambassador said, it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has still not been overcome, quite hectic. </seg>
<seg id="293"> And there is still the seven - year EU budget is approved, but the matter because of today &apos;s economic situation is much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="294"> Whether or not it is a slim and Thrifty budget, which industries take precedence, which countries more or less will all of that is now on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="295"> The ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with which it came to Brussels: “ understandable on Europe ”. </seg>
<seg id="296"> “ If there is one thing I do not like, then it is gräuliche acronym, concepts and technical jargon, which no one understands. </seg>
<seg id="297"> How can I as citizens actually know whether Brussels really curly or round cucumbers and variable invented just bananas or whether we actually someone Quargel wants to ban. </seg>

<seg id="300"> According to the EU Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics, to be, the more the negative, the positive side of the matter. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Even more galling is the poor representation by the Czechs in european institutions. </seg>
<seg id="302"> There are many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to Motivierungsbriefe to write and, last but not least, the weak support the czech side. </seg>

<seg id="304"> “ Do you think if a Pole or hungarian come to me and a Slovak in the vicinity, says the Frenchman next to me: “ Hey, what is it because the heads together - is the back your V4? ” and will not make a fairly acid straight face. </seg>
<seg id="305"> Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states. </seg>

<seg id="310"> “ There will be more and more of these institutions, which, in the end, on a strong “ a multi - speed Europe ”, ” Mrs Vicenová expected. </seg>
<seg id="311"> In this respect, it also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all the issues with the impact on the whole of the EU by all member states must be discussed and not just by the countries of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="312"> Story: fire </seg>
<seg id="313"> The innovator IBM enters into its second century of existence </seg>
<seg id="314"> They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this is the word “ longevity. ” </seg>
<seg id="315"> For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although since its establishment in a century has passed. </seg>
<seg id="316"> On this basis the longevity, already their first chief visionary behind Thomas J. Watson Sen. </seg>
<seg id="317"> Already he was of the slogan, countless global problems could be solved easily, if people were prepared to make a little bit of thinking. </seg>
<seg id="318"> Its slogan “ think! ” has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants place should (and, at the same time, to the title of the internal magazine on IBM as long ago as 1935 began issuing). </seg>
<seg id="319"> This was also the basis of Watsen well prepared business culture. </seg>
<seg id="320"> “ For us from IBM, this long - term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="321"> IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to his principles and not shying away from everything else all around it to change. </seg>
<seg id="322"> The allowed us, in the course of the first century, the technology, the business and society to transform. </seg>
<seg id="323"> We hope that in the next 100 years, creating even more, ” said Samuel J. Palmisano, who is now director of the company, marking the anniversary. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Educational system </seg>
<seg id="325"> Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its workforce, in a similar way, as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia, the IBM - people had, as one of the first american workers paid holidays, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and a thoughtful set for best creators and distributors. </seg>
<seg id="326"> As more sophisticated, the long - term relationship of IBM with their customers. </seg>
<seg id="327"> The company was, from the beginning, the brilliant in the Talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM on any discrimination, and could be scheduled to pick and choose. </seg>
<seg id="328"> In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman will invariably - of Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="329"> Is the only 30 years at IBM, has adopted the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and Strategiechefin. </seg>
<seg id="330"> IBM makes in the last few years, so - called online Brainstormings, from where many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="331"> No wonder - ideas there is enough in the company is almost half a million people. </seg>
<seg id="332"> An institution with a good reputation </seg>
<seg id="333"> Its strong position in the business guaranteed the company a strong image and this inside and outside. </seg>
<seg id="334"> “ From the beginning, IBM had more of the concept of an institution, as a technology company, ” said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="335"> “ IBM is not a technology company, but a firm Geschäftsprobleme through technology helps solve, ” added George Colony of - Consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="336"> As the company has stressed, there is a difference in the market only to be present or it with this presence directly. </seg>
<seg id="337"> IBM in the states of their logos for family “ Big Blue ” is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown. </seg>
<seg id="338"> It is one of the most diverse technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and Konsultationsleistungen with incredible - purpose of servers to nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Of all american technology company IBM most patents and five of its staff members were awarded the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="340"> His best - known inventions include, for example, ATM machines, credit cards, Finanzswap bar code, or even the Diskette. </seg>
<seg id="341"> With around $20 billion stock market value (by market capitalization) IBM during this year, the second - largest technology companies (right after Apple), and for the first time since 1996 Microsoft obsolete. </seg>
<seg id="342"> Looking ahead </seg>
<seg id="343"> Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate, for example, the attempt to their own operating system, OS / 2, the online service Prodigy, or the computer IBM pc Jr. </seg>
<seg id="344"> “ Business is based on the moving forward, so we should not be emotionell to the past ”, according to Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="345"> That is why IBM is not a problem, his ground on various platforms to build, and if they do not work, they also must leave. </seg>
<seg id="346"> In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Promising technologies </seg>
<seg id="348"> In the profits of IBM committed to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in each one - fifth. </seg>
<seg id="349"> It was still in 1990 with a hardware fünfzigprozentigem share more than most. </seg>
<seg id="350"> Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets at a value of $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of the future technologies. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In these investment goes IBM after 2008, as the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world fegte. </seg>
<seg id="352"> IBM also was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, in the midst of the Great Depression of its large scale of investment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> So far, it appears that the company IBM today &apos;s crisis emerges unscathed. </seg>
<seg id="354"> The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig by 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The Unternehmensslogan of IBM is: everything can change - not only the values. </seg>
<seg id="356"> It is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis. </seg>

<seg id="413"> But hand on heart, which Ms believes it has already, in search of a well - seated Oberbekleidung only through a Kleidergeschäft to bummeln and not all (in all kinds of Farbkombinationen) in the booth to try? </seg>
<seg id="414"> Even if the shopping for the majority of women is a hobby, for men, it is often the pure hell. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Consider it just as often, her husband said, it is better you out there … </seg>

<seg id="441"> I think any of us has a harmless bit of gossip to camp. </seg>
<seg id="442"> Believe me, this is all women. </seg>
<seg id="443"> But that is not to be confused with the major Klatschtanten calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, who are all in their area and contempt for the particularly Frauenkollektive represent a significant danger. </seg>
<seg id="444"> Jágr and Voráček gave Philadelphia with their Assistenzen to victory </seg>

<seg id="452"> A bit later, the second hit “ a czech track. ” </seg>

<seg id="454"> A second before the Abpfiff the first third of the Heimspieler Patrick Dwyer a Short - Hander, but the second was one - third then again the Flyers. </seg>

<seg id="462"> “ All the years in the NHL, my players their game on me and now turns the tables in order, ” schmunzelte Jágr. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Carolina made game even more to the tragedy - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who is from a Strafschuss hold, in a door. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Matt Read prevented any further complication, in which he was successful, there are two against one. </seg>
<seg id="465"> “ Goody goody acted Pronger still in our region. ” </seg>
<seg id="466"> “ He got off the Puck, I took on and (Read) led to more distant amongst these groups result. ” </seg>

<seg id="470"> The Candiens losing in addition to her know Beck also their leadership in a unverloren Penalty - shooting 2 - 3. </seg>
<seg id="471"> One of the Strafschüsse Tomáš Plekanec could not convert. </seg>
<seg id="472"> More than the lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team is the high illness shortfall in the defensive - the game they played only with five Abwehrspielern to end. </seg>
<seg id="473"> “ That is a bad thing. ” </seg>
<seg id="474"> “ The game we play with only a single experienced players, to the end of the rest were young players. ” </seg>
<seg id="475"> “ But there is nothing so that we must be ready, ” said Jacques Martin. </seg>
<seg id="476"> “ Any change in wave after wave of others and we had nothing. ” </seg>
<seg id="477"> “ We had the game easier and the Puck from our third rausbringen. ” </seg>
<seg id="478"> There was still room, ” said P. K. Subban, one of the Abwehrspieler. </seg>
<seg id="479"> The Czech gate - keepers Ondřej Pavelec rejected 30 shots for Tampa Bay, and was so essential to the 5 - 2 victory over Winnipeg. </seg>
<seg id="480"> At the gates of the jets, a series of five defeats concluded, had five different shooter share. </seg>
<seg id="481"> Development of higher fares since 1989. </seg>
<seg id="482"> In 1989, there have been only five in the then ČSSR approved state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
<seg id="483"> The travel agents sold at the time, above all, only travel in the socialist eastern bloc countries, in the West, at that time only on the select few. </seg>
<seg id="484"> And so went czech tourists in the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the German Democratic Republic (GDR)), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Korean Peninsula, Crimea, on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea and Hungary to use it. </seg>
<seg id="485"> An exception was the light of the period from 1962 to 1972, when we travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia a pro - western course and that is why the trips to Yugoslavia severely restricted. </seg>
<seg id="486"> A great paradox of the socialist times it was that it is not even citizens of the soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was, in the context of the socialist countries to travel freely. </seg>
<seg id="487"> If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union to, then took a so - called Einladungsbrief, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible. </seg>
<seg id="488"> Even then, the travel agents also travel to the West, but then had to be huge queues at, or even in the hot - water bottle in the travel agency sleep, or at least good “ well - known ” in the travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Even so, the issue has not gone. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The so - called Devisenzusage - the condition for an exit in the west, has only been “ politically reliable ” people granted to the other could not travel. </seg>
<seg id="491"> The czech currency was not free umtauschbare currency without Devisenzusage, it would be impossible to have the necessary financial resources (western) currency for a trip to the West finding. </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Czechs weither therefore spent most of their holidays at home, it &apos;s no surprise that the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit still continues. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The Velvet Revolution of 1989, followed by a Reiserevolution the Czechs in the foot. </seg>
<seg id="494"> Until 1989 during a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things were spent the Czechs in the last year of their Auslandsferien 4.5 million in countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id="495"> A huge paradox, of which one is now no longer is aware, is the fact that you are currently in the most popular holiday destination enjoys the Czechs - Croatia to 1989, is not being able to go, because it is part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="496"> From the beginning of the 1990s, the last century to the Devisenpflicht in neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which is a huge wave of Kurzbesuchen above all to Vienna in Austria and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="497"> The Tschechoslowaken able for a long time, of their movements in the West simply cannot get enough of, everyone wanted to at least a few days there have been. </seg>
<seg id="498"> So slept the czech tourists in travel to Paris in the tent city in the park, because who would have the money to stay in one of the hotel or in a pension. </seg>
<seg id="499"> A typical feature on foreign travel by the Czechs then was a with tins, beer and Dauerwurst etc. vollgepackter boot. </seg>
<seg id="500"> Another important milestone was the introduction of the Czech - free umtauschbaren crown after decades could be our tourists the western currency finally free to buy. </seg>
<seg id="501"> Our standard of living and thereby also Durchschnittsgehälter rose, in 1997 in another important moment einmündete. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Thanks to the increased demand for travel began the travel agents after 1997 regularly travels through the charter flights to prepare the air travel, thanks to the possibility of Mengenrabatte negotiate, than in the past, incredibly cheap. </seg>
<seg id="503"> At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments on all of the advanced countries in the world, as the travel even easier. </seg>
<seg id="504"> Another interesting moment in the history of the “ post - velvet ” travel has occurred in 2000, when thanks to high demand the first direct charter flight in an exotic country handles - to Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="506"> Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel each year in exotic countries. </seg>
<seg id="507"> Another important moment in the era of the “ post - revolutionary ” development marked, came in 2008. </seg>
<seg id="508"> On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirements for czech tourists on, which is the country most definitely in the advanced countries in the world have brutalized. </seg>
<seg id="509"> In 2008, spent the Czechs, for the first time more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in its history, they spent for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt destinations, including the cost at more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita. </seg>
<seg id="510"> The general meeting to find a new chairman - again threatened a stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="511"> Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and there is that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association (Czech FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know. </seg>
<seg id="512"> To this day, there are still no agreement on the electoral law would be elected. </seg>
<seg id="513"> And without that, there is no vote on the three potential successor. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="515"> In June, Hašek of his role, and his colleagues in the departure of inviting had come to an agreement and a strong person to find the football to follow. </seg>
<seg id="516"> Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old spat between the two Verbandskammern once again, which is not on a joint candidate can agree. </seg>
<seg id="517"> This was clearly on September 16, as the new chairman should be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="518"> The delegates to the general meeting were free of the Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the trial led to no result and it was not only about the election itself. </seg>
<seg id="519"> One could not even agree on who in the Vollsammlung actually vote - are only the statutory representatives or with a power - wielding officials. </seg>
<seg id="520"> In this one point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in Vollmachtbasis not admissible. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The disputes in the electoral law, however, continue to take in. </seg>
<seg id="522"> The executive committee did not have more clarity on the issue, in whose meetings - regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Even if the ideas about the choice of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same. </seg>
<seg id="524"> The question is: how can we in the third round, a stalemate to avoid? </seg>
<seg id="525"> “ The bone of contention is the question of whether it is in line with the statutes of action, or whether a very different model must be found, ” said the Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice - chairman of the FAČR, which in the management of the professional football. </seg>
<seg id="526"> According to a registered model prevails in the third round one candidate, the greater the prozentuelle support in the chamber, for which he is standing. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Moravia is said to be ready to compromise on that one candidate wins out, the higher the number of votes from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="528"> The Czech Republic, in turn, is on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count at least a two - thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id="529"> “ Then, the two Vorrunden make no sense, this way, all the Zweikammerkonzept in question, ” Svoboda understands the objections of the moravian side, the best there is, the electoral law not tweaking, but under current statutes to choose. </seg>
<seg id="530"> The true surprisingly Tomáš Paclík to, even if it is apparent that the statutory election rules of all the candidates most likely to be Pelta meet. </seg>
<seg id="531"> “ My wish is that as far as possible after the statute is elected. ” </seg>
<seg id="532"> “ So that no nonsensical Ersatzvarianten up, as in the last general meeting, ” said the owner of the Victoria (clubs) Plzeň which, for the first time, standing in his opinions and, above all, to Pelta abgrenzte. </seg>
<seg id="533"> Pelta but remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="534"> In his view, will be in the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidates in the future will work constructively. </seg>
<seg id="535"> “ The possible qualifications of the national team for the Euro today would be sure to reassure the people. ” </seg>
<seg id="536"> “ If the football until the euphoric wave ride, it is also the willingness to cooperate more, ” said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience and both at professional, and regional level. </seg>
<seg id="537"> Rajchl there is more circumspect. </seg>
<seg id="538"> “ I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent. ” </seg>
<seg id="539"> “ It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules to witness the “ baseline ”. ” </seg>
<seg id="540"> “ That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded. ” </seg>
<seg id="541"> “ I hope, however, that the common sense prevails in the end, ” said Rajchl. </seg>
<seg id="542"> Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is not. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Some negotiations must be supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification at all will be completely. </seg>
<seg id="544"> The Charterflugzeug, amongst other things and Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice fly should, in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder do not start and so it sought urgently for a Ersatzvariante, as a part of the executive committee, but are still on the site of the Barrage - Hinspiels. </seg>
<seg id="545"> At the end of the day, then surely the meeting at ministerial level is essential to the supposedly it on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands the country would like to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="547"> There is a lot at stake: benefits of the Czech Vertrauungswürdigkeit football and the forthcoming general meeting of the czech ČSTV, the sport after the financial problems of Sazka &apos;s new direction. </seg>
<seg id="548"> Paclík is in the fight for the position of the chairman, because it is not a suitable candidates </seg>
<seg id="549"> If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting of a strong candidate would have picked up, all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) met, he would do not relate to the fight for this position of concessions. </seg>
<seg id="550"> “ When there is a good candidate, then I would strive for it and to the election. ” </seg>
<seg id="551"> “ But in the current situation, we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find, ” said Paclík ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The main reason for Paclík, into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go, it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, that the head of the FAČR. </seg>
<seg id="553"> Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the function of the chairman of just one year plans to exercise, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary shareholders&apos; meeting. </seg>
<seg id="554"> In the position of the chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in the Fußballgeschehen is involved. </seg>
<seg id="555"> “ With some eligible people in person. ” </seg>
<seg id="556"> “ Hard to believe that some people have said that they want to do is not currently with the czech football. </seg>
<seg id="557"> “ Those views would like to have changed, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="558"> Most of all, disturbs Paclík supposedly Pelta &apos;s link with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands Berbr novel, a man with kontroversem reputation, the behind - the - scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to Delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings to influence. </seg>
<seg id="559"> For Paclík is, therefore, that it is unacceptable that Pelta, held the position of the chairman. </seg>
<seg id="560"> “ In his victory would today &apos;s state einkonserviert and in the czech football is not making any progress at all. ” </seg>
<seg id="561"> “ The support provided by Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, football twice badly, ” said Paclík. </seg>
<seg id="562"> Now he is also essential that Pelta &apos;s name some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen to identify in a Korruptionsaffaire fell from the Pelta, however, emerged with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="563"> “ I do not know what the prestige of a victory by the Pelta (tsch.) football should get involved. ” </seg>
<seg id="564"> “ And as we would in the eyes of the FIFA and UEFA off, ” said řekl Paclík, his former utterance, “ he will sell the Pilsner football club, if Pelta chairman will ”, but something more coolly. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In the Donnerstagwahl Paclík should win, he would, however, be a future cooperation with Pelta quite imagine. </seg>
<seg id="566"> Just as thinks another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the General Assembly in October had supported with a fiasco. </seg>
<seg id="567"> “ He (Pelta) would be the first, on which I would go. ” </seg>
<seg id="568"> “ He has great ability. ” </seg>
<seg id="569"> “ I would have him well, for example, as head of the national team. ” </seg>
<seg id="570"> “ But I do not think that it is capable of, the association as a manager. ” </seg>
<seg id="571"> “ I caught my nose but not in issues that I do not understand, ” said Paclík in September that raised eyebrows – that he was behind the dismissing the Schiedsrichterkommission with Luďěk Macela at the top, was the Dagmar Damková replaced. </seg>
<seg id="572"> Paclík claims that he felt the role of the Verbandsvorsitzenden increased. </seg>
<seg id="573"> And holding up his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen which, with its support in May, the first triumph in the league. </seg>
<seg id="574"> “ I have the power to do so, something in the Fußballmilieu to change and to a certain degree of cultivation of this. ” </seg>
<seg id="575"> “ In order to limit the influence of interest groups, which tend to disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen to influence what by in - bound descends into situations, ” led to the Paclík, no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta &apos;s leader, Daniel Křetínský. </seg>
<seg id="576"> As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the czech Olympic Committee, with the help of the political leaders to live that more money from Lotteriesteuer in the sport. </seg>
<seg id="577"> “ This is one of the key things, to which the new chairman should pay attention to. ” </seg>
<seg id="578"> “ If it on the taxation of Glückspielen, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but there must be clear where the money is going, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="579"> His connection to the club Paclík Pilsner is also not a handicap in, even though he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR need to “ bipartisan ”. </seg>
<seg id="580"> Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec Rajchl, with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="581"> “ This is not ideal. ” </seg>
<seg id="582"> “ It makes my opinion but also not much point in my shares in the club to a Drittperson Pilsner hypocritical to after a year and a half back again, ” said the Paclík clear. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, the stalemate in future ausschlössen. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt Miroslav Pelta, namely that he would do in the event of his election campaign for the new statutes FAČR gets in the future disputes over the electoral law, rule out. </seg>
<seg id="585"> The official from Jablonec is before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in the event of success of the Czech selection sure. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds. </seg>
<seg id="587"> He decided at the last moment, in the election before the last general meeting to participate in the two - month pause it might help to put his ideas on the leadership of the football to defend and in a wider context. </seg>
<seg id="588"> “ People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president on Thursday is known. ” </seg>
<seg id="589"> “ He feels that it is high time that the Association of someone who is headed, says the man who, in particular, with the club Jablonecer is linked, but also many years in Sparta, and in the executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Also, he has said that it has sufficient experience, the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="591"> He is convinced that for today &apos;s problems with the election of the euphoria is responsible, in the days of Ivan Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="592"> “ Unfortunately, in the shareholders&apos; meeting in June approved statutes, which do not fully, as it had all assumed. </seg>
<seg id="593"> If they are not allowed to different interpretations, we should have, as of September, already had a chairman, ” Pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="594"> The review of the most important document of the residents&apos; association he used as a sweetener to the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="595"> “ I should be president, then I will accept the me personally and I am personally prepared to take responsibility if it does not work. ” </seg>
<seg id="596"> “ It is a matter of principle, without which it can be, ” Pelta said. </seg>
<seg id="597"> In addition, he did not try to stand up to his opponent. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Earlier, he had announced that he can work with Jindřich Rajchl imagine, because of his legal education recognises and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy. </seg>
<seg id="599"> He also Tomáš Paclík, it has been for a long time, which, in turn, no dry thread to Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="600"> In football, he is more than a year and can already in some successes. ” </seg>
<seg id="601"> “ His attacks were herabsetzend, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign. ” </seg>
<seg id="602"> “ Also doubt now many of his true nature, ” Pelta addressed his opponent, the most faithful to his proclamations remain, for which it has in September. </seg>
<seg id="603"> In his view, the most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football of the lowest divisions, to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="604"> And this should be the hallmark of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="605"> “ I would try to do all Affairen to end - of fog Bohemians, up to the Nachhallen the Korruptionsskandals last year. ” </seg>
<seg id="606"> “ Afterwards I on negotiations with the private and public sector to sufficient funding for the whole of football ”, said the candidate sechsundvierzigjährige ČTK two months ago. </seg>
<seg id="607"> At the time, he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football no human cleansing would mean. </seg>
<seg id="608"> “ I would have to start with the monitor all workers get to know, ” he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the length of the anarchy understandably nervous. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk not in vain. </seg>
<seg id="610"> “ If there is really the only point of contention is how, in the third round, then we will get over that. ” </seg>
<seg id="611"> “ The football needs credibility and that wins it will only back when he finally has a new Leader ” Pelta, two days before the potentially decisive day Funktionärskarriere optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins </seg>
<seg id="613"> If the former vice - chairman of Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim of vermiesen. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard to begin. </seg>
<seg id="615"> He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual Fußballbereiche. </seg>
<seg id="616"> He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA to improve, more money in football and otherwise, to continue the work of the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek has begun. </seg>
<seg id="617"> “ As Chairman, I would like to football as a whole. ” </seg>
<seg id="618"> From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the Nationalauswahl, professional football, up to and including the Leistungsfußball for young people. ” </seg>
<seg id="619"> “ This is not to say that I want to do it all, ” said Rajchl in talks for ČTK. </seg>
<seg id="620"> “ I am a Teamspieler, and therefore the powers of the executive committee, so that every member of a certain area. ” </seg>
<seg id="621"> And I will work hard so that the football in each segment at moving forward. ” </seg>
<seg id="622"> There were many enchanted, because they, rather than the work of other to criticise now itself really began to work hard, ” he added. </seg>
<seg id="623"> Because of the critical atmosphere in the Fußballbewegung have considered, no longer standing. </seg>
<seg id="624"> “ I know that I am working 20 hours a day. ” </seg>
<seg id="625"> “ But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, I did not constantly put spokes and every step I make, in question, ” he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="626"> “ A lot of people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise there other. ” </seg>
<seg id="627"> “ The trust is that we should not waste, ” he said. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Allegedly motivated him to continue the work, which he suffered Hašek has begun. </seg>
<seg id="629"> “ In two years we have a great deal of work done and I will now not simply throw away. ” </seg>
<seg id="630"> “ It processes have been launched, the only in a few years to play out, and I would hate to see that they stop someone, ” he said, and now his concerns to saying that, in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return. </seg>
<seg id="631"> “ I believe in systematic approach and that is something that Mirek Pelta not. ” </seg>
<seg id="632"> “ Behind him, especially people who made the football would make that he only for exclusivity is there. ” </seg>
<seg id="633"> I may be some of the accused, but not that I would be biased. ” </seg>
<seg id="634"> “ I am trying to do, to be objective. ” </seg>
<seg id="635"> “ I want football for all of them, because it then all is well and not only the specially selected, ” said Rajchl. </seg>

<seg id="694"> This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
<seg id="695"> The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid - October. </seg>
<seg id="696"> It shows the author Harald Schumann, the betting on the global commodity exchanges pushing up prices, and the banks therefore complicit in the global hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="697"> The campaign by the defender is targeted specifically against Deutsche Bank, head Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Originally, Rohstoffwetten intended for traders to hedge price. </seg>
<seg id="699"> But in the meantime, most experts agree that the gamblers from supply and demand have - and at the expense of the poorest profits. </seg>
<seg id="700"> Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to to investigate allegations and said, “ there is no business worth, the reputation of the german bank to put at risk. ” </seg>
<seg id="701"> According to information from looking into a mirror ONLINE international working group is currently the accusations of the Foodwatch Report. </seg>

<seg id="705"> Ackermann tinkering with his image </seg>
<seg id="706"> Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: “ the betting on rising food prices shows a particularly vivid, as reckless banks today the common good. ” </seg>

<seg id="708"> “ The german bank must all sites from its portfolio, in which money for betting on food prices will be used, ” Bode said. </seg>
<seg id="709"> “ Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the german bank is concerned. ” </seg>
<seg id="710"> The insight of Ackermann is at first glance a surprise, however, it is clear that, by the president of the company himself a few months before his departure from the office of a perfect picture. </seg>
<seg id="711"> On Monday, the german bank, announced that the CEO is different than planned not to its Board of change. </seg>

<seg id="722"> The pavilion umgezogene </seg>
<seg id="723"> By Mrs Wiensowski </seg>
<seg id="724"> A Architekturgeschichte highs, lows and happy endings — the austrian Weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels in 1958, was won by prices in Vienna for the museum, was empty and verkam. </seg>
<seg id="725"> It is now as Ausstellungshaus re - opened. </seg>
<seg id="726"> If of modern post geschwärmt will clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, the typical of the belief in the technological progress, then the austrian pavilion of the architects of Karl Schwanzer for Brussels&apos; World Expo in 1958 and famous is a good example. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Grand Prix d &apos;Architecture for his easy and float - looking - glass - steel construction. </seg>
<seg id="728"> The building has, to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="729"> He made the architects so well known that the and at the next World Expo austrian pavilion built. </seg>
<seg id="730"> With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was in 1973, after all, internationally renowned. </seg>
<seg id="731"> His Ausstellungsbau planned as a temporary pavilion had been following the exhibition in the swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof established in 1962, and converted to a museum of the 20th century - opened the 1920s “ House ” it was called. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Lift the building but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="733"> It was, however, so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more. </seg>
<seg id="735"> Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion rebuilt, he is now “ 21er House ” and will, in the future, as a museum of contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="736"> On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum, which the House, where the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in every respect. </seg>
<seg id="737"> Won the restart Agnes Husslein - Arco, 2007, the new director of the austrian gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Husslein - Arco, qualified art historian, with considerable career including the young people as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby &apos;s, the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of the modern era than Gründungsdirektorin Salzburg, converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern by, they provided public funds and private Sponsorengelder and established the use. </seg>
<seg id="739"> Except Gegenwartskunst should the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous Foundation issued a café and a bookshop, and it should be a Bürohaus had to be built. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
<seg id="741"> For the operation was then Krischanitz the ideal person to work. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Not only because it Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna Secession sensitive converted and extended and won the competition, but also because he is in Schwanzer in the technical Vienna University and has studied the pavilion for him a “ incredibly important ” was the ground when he felt “ almost every weekend, ” the exhibitions considered. </seg>
<seg id="743"> He knew the Ur - draft, and he was very familiar with the problems of the building, which at its transfer to Vienna and its Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost. </seg>
<seg id="744"> At this restructuring, there was far greater problems: the building was “ a Energieschleuder, ” says Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Fensterprofile the outside glass of have changed, glasfaserverstärktes Isolierglas set up and the Glasdach by special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Kältebrücken - damaged are more or been replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Two Untergeschosse made room for the new use, a abgesenkter Lichtgraben between House and road will ensure the Belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer - pavilion. </seg>
<seg id="748"> The original Außentüren have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz - Farbton removed. </seg>
<seg id="749"> And the theatre is even more closely as it used to be. </seg>
<seg id="750"> All under strict supervision of Denkmalbehörde and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="751"> “ Often had a material are found, it is good and proper, and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked, ” says Krischanitz and points to a raw ground in Untergeschoss. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Despite all the pressures, problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy. </seg>
<seg id="753"> It is difficult, with the pavilion, “ the came from Brussels, ” Krischanitz recently said that a typical “ rates - in - the - City - history. ” </seg>
<seg id="754"> So a architecture is “ always in the wrong place ” and wanted to give a proper still “ awareness ”. </seg>
<seg id="755"> In this case, the 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is a stroke of urban happened: the swiss garden is emerging around the entirely new planned “ Hauptbahnhofsquartier ”, with office and residential buildings. </seg>
<seg id="756"> And another stroke of luck may be happen: the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz - construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin temporary Kunsthalle bought, and we hear, they have negotiated with the city for a neighbourly location within the swiss garden. </seg>

<seg id="846"> The photograph of the Brandruine Solingen is deeply rooted in the german and turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a real threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance in right - wing violence could result. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The attacks, however, sharpened the we - feeling on the turkish side. </seg>
<seg id="849"> Not repeat the mistakes of the past </seg>
<seg id="850"> In the turkish press at the time, in particular, the failure of the german policy after the attacks, criticizes, Helmut Kohl refused, the survivors of Mölln to visit. </seg>
<seg id="851"> After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the turkish President, at his funeral in Cologne but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was at the time in his speech on how many charges but Turks. </seg>
<seg id="852"> As berechne is the value of a people for the level of its very. </seg>
<seg id="853"> The current reporting the turkish media shows once again how deeply the suspicion of many Turk from Bremen in the abandonment of rule of law since then. </seg>
<seg id="854"> In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re - evaluation of the extreme right - wing terrorism in Germany needs this time it openly. </seg>
<seg id="855"> The Skandalbank by Zürisee </seg>
<seg id="856"> The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="857"> The UBS during the financial crisis was nearly bankrupt and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Now it is a german. </seg>
<seg id="859"> It had thus Axel Weber is certainly not intended. </seg>
<seg id="860"> After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was in July 2013 honourable, that he almost as a spectacular new job candidates: Verwaltungsratspräsident UBS, the swiss banking - unexpected and lucrative Karriereschritt. </seg>
<seg id="861"> Axel Weber was public, praised the Switzerland whether their beauty and the UBS whether their newly acquired solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="862"> “ The UBS has the Turnaround managed ”. </seg>
<seg id="863"> “ I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel. ” </seg>
<seg id="864"> But already in September, it was clear that things in an entirely different way. </seg>
<seg id="865"> A trader of UBS in London all security systems of the bank violated and around 1.7 billion euro gambling found themselves. </seg>
<seg id="866"> - UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="867"> The Verwaltungsratspräsident since then as the UBS is also wounded and all ask: when will finally come Axel Weber? </seg>
<seg id="868"> Already, it became known that Weber &apos;s February 2012 to discuss. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And the Verwaltungsratsvorsitz takes it back in May, not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday told us. </seg>
<seg id="870"> For Axel Weber will be tough. </seg>
<seg id="871"> He is not a banker, rather Ökonomieprofessor and central bankers and have an apprenticeship period certainly needed. </seg>
<seg id="872"> At a stroke, he will take over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just once again has demonstrated that they have long the title of “ Europe &apos;s biggest Skandalbank deserves. ” </seg>
<seg id="873"> Because the UBS has one huge - until recently, it was the largest asset managers in the world - and slides, on the other hand, for years by a scandal in the next. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Nothing, it seems, is the once proud swiss bank. </seg>
<seg id="875"> It began in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="876"> Until 2007, the UBS an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="877"> The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften swiss Vermögensverwalters they had combined with ambitious targets: you also wanted to, the investment banking business is a very large number. </seg>
<seg id="878"> So managed the UBS in 2007, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollar high - net - worth customers more money than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="879"> And, on the other hand, was it as an investment bank in the league of the world &apos;s largest banks huddle. </seg>
<seg id="880"> That made sense. </seg>
<seg id="881"> The former banker and subsequent long - standing Bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans auditions told: “ my students, I have the UBS then always as a good bank. ” </seg>
<seg id="882"> “ From today &apos;s perspective, one wonders, how could I just so wrong? ” </seg>
<seg id="883"> He was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="884"> In 2007, for the first time, it would appear that something substantial schieflief in the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="885"> In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising back until that as hochintellektueller and ingenious bankers. </seg>
<seg id="886"> A few months later, suspecting it, how he had taken. </seg>
<seg id="887"> The Investmentsparte the bank had with sub - papers gambling found themselves and had to write off billion. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In order to absorb the UBS announced a capital increase to the tune of as many as 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="889"> For investors, it was, in fact, however, what, on some until shortly before the nose gerümpft: a non - transparent asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an arab sovereign wealth funds, so the silence was that they did not even his name. </seg>
<seg id="890"> But this was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="891"> In April 2008, there were worse. </seg>
<seg id="892"> The bank had to announce new Milliardenverluste, Marcel Ospel Verwaltungsratspräsident, is still the second - best - paid on board of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="893"> In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis and the collapse of the state had to be rescued. </seg>
<seg id="894"> The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation, six billion francs for a Zwangswandelanleihe they Miteigentümerin of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="895"> The whole country was shocked - because she has said, as dramatic for a small country, if it is so large banks. </seg>
<seg id="896"> After all, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the performance of the Switzerland (see chart). </seg>
<seg id="897"> “ Once again, we could not save the UBS, ” says Bankenforscher auditions. </seg>
<seg id="898"> In the first disaster joined the second. </seg>
<seg id="899"> A few months later, surrendered the UBS in the tax dispute with America and declared that it was prepared to make the data high - net - worth clients, perhaps with the help of the bank had evaded taxes. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Moreover, they pay a 780 - million - dollar as repayment of unjustified profits from this business and Strafaufschlag. </seg>
<seg id="901"> So that the well - known UBS more or less open to tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="902"> At the same time it lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="903"> After the scandal was the swiss banking secrecy is not the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="904"> It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Verwaltungsratspräsident. </seg>
<seg id="905"> And the exodus of Kundengeldern. </seg>
<seg id="906"> The bank within a few months of their credibility in two key portfolios lost: in the investment banking and wealth management in the speculation errors made by the aid to tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="907"> And just when it was a little calmer, just when you thought, here &apos;s UBS will get it back, there is this unfortunate traders - history: an individual traders gambling found themselves 1.7 billion euros before the bank notes that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="908"> And it appears to be: with the risk management, the investment banking business it operates are obviously still not. </seg>
<seg id="909"> “ With the case of Adoboli, we find that the risk controls too little has changed, ” says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanzprofessor on banking institution of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="910"> The Finanzvorstand a major german bank is sure: “ the problem of UBS is that it will contain not under control. ” </seg>
<seg id="911"> It was just the idea of caution, with the swiss bankers for a long time was launched, guardian of the major assets of the world: not too much risks, for security for money - went beyond the Alpenrepublik times the world would collapse. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The coffers of the swiss banks were a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and especially noble Sprüngli for chocolate. </seg>
<seg id="913"> The UBS &apos;s headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the sterling swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger. </seg>
<seg id="914"> The situation is standard practice. </seg>
<seg id="915"> The bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße by the Central Station from directly to the Zürichsee leads by the covered summits of the swiss mountains frames. </seg>
<seg id="916"> The buildings here are magnificent, the Ladenmieten are among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Jewellers as Tiffany &apos;s will be here as the swiss Traditionsgeschäften Confiserie Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="918"> For centuries, the swiss banks, the National Bank of the palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear. </seg>
<seg id="919"> The Empfangssaal the UBS enters one by a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Inside, the walls are thick marmorverkleidet, empty chair, in addition to the bank - logo is a great sign for the “ safe ”. </seg>
<seg id="921"> The UBS know what the customer is looking for here: safety. </seg>
<seg id="922"> This idea of the swiss bank have both swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point out - or betrayed, as the head of a small swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="923"> His name, he preferred not to read in the press, after all, like all swiss bankers, even with the two big business. </seg>
<seg id="924"> The UBS has become far too big, it will, especially in the investment banking business, which is also the Anglo - saxons have spread. </seg>
<seg id="925"> The Swiss have there is nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="926"> “ And if you are, they have a long time ago the habits of the Anglo - saxons. ” </seg>
<seg id="927"> Indeed, it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, the UBS changed its high profits and induced then the debacle: no european financial institution in the sub - prime jungle so much lost money as the swiss banking. </seg>
<seg id="928"> On 15 October 2008, the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="929"> “ On that Wednesday decided the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bail - out in the history of their nation, ” writes the author Lucas Hässig in his book “ the UBS - crunch. ” </seg>
<seg id="930"> Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros for the politicians to the bankruptcy of the large bank to save. </seg>
<seg id="931"> How could this happen? </seg>
<seg id="932"> When you talk with swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="933"> In June 1998, two of the three swiss banks to a huge corporation. </seg>
<seg id="934"> There was a bank that has been in the merger was too large for the small country of Switzerland and continue to grow. </seg>
<seg id="935"> It helped that the two different precursor, the banks UBS supplemented: a rich, but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalised. </seg>
<seg id="936"> Suddenly, the investment banker internationalised favourable to a great deal of money, with a huge wheel. </seg>
<seg id="937"> Two names are with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Konzernchef of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="938"> “ I always thought that Wuffli Ospel and were a Traumteam, ” says Hans Bankenforscher auditions. </seg>
<seg id="939"> “ Wuffli, the Hochintellektuelle, the modest, and a great deal of models and statistics, and understands the Bauchmensch Ospel, from the top of the Banklehre heraufgearbeitet. ” </seg>
<seg id="940"> But Ospel has finally Wuffli leave. </seg>
<seg id="941"> And Wuffli was probably at the end of a fatal error: “ he thought his models are the reality, ” says auditions. </seg>
<seg id="942"> “ This is a tragic case. ” </seg>
<seg id="943"> Tragic, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="944"> It is clear: an excess came before the fall. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Staff of the UBS will remember clearly to the leaders - meetings, on which Konzernchef Wuffli again and again on the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone. </seg>
<seg id="946"> The american bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="947"> She led the “ League Tables ” rankings that the success of the banks that time documented. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Then, after UBS wanted to the top. </seg>
<seg id="949"> Some of the steps were her deals. </seg>
<seg id="950"> In the Devisengeschäft and in the trading in shares, she played with top. </seg>
<seg id="951"> The consultant, were called, but a weakness: in international Zinsgeschäft, in the “ Bankersprache fixed income ”, there is a huge gap on the biggest banks. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The UBS have gaps in american Hypothekenprodukten. </seg>
<seg id="953"> To close the gap left UBS in an adventure that they almost the existence of cost. </seg>
<seg id="954"> Hungry for growth, both invested by the Bank itself, as well as a before her established hedge funds in american subprime assets. </seg>
<seg id="955"> It has become a huge machine, the securities on american packaged mortgage lending and passing - but also risks even maintained. </seg>
<seg id="956"> Also, as other banks for a long time out. </seg>
<seg id="957"> “ Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market in flames, the UBS bought there, ” says Bankenexperte auditions. </seg>
<seg id="958"> The euphoria, so deep the case. </seg>
<seg id="959"> A manager after the others had to go, the attempts to clean up are more difficult than had been thought. </seg>
<seg id="960"> Item in the UBS, for this and to date have been shaky. </seg>
<seg id="961"> Who now leads the large bank, has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="962"> It needs a strategy for a bank to find all the obvious abhandengekommen business models. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Bankenforscher auditions has already an idea: put an end to the focus on investment banking, asset management, return to the swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Quite so far to the bank while do not (yet). </seg>
<seg id="965"> But to shrink the investment banking firm, it is already clear. </seg>
<seg id="966"> On Thursday, will the new Bankchef Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The 51 - year - old italian - swiss was really a temporary solution designed, as the Bank is surprising of predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="968"> Now he has pushed through: he is the business of the UBS, shared the Zurich Bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Ermotti wants the investment bank to the levels in the mid - 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="970"> He cut 3,500 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="971"> But that will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="972"> The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="973"> Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="974"> And they want to make money? </seg>
<seg id="975"> These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now. </seg>
<seg id="976"> Publicly he says so far, only that he and his wife once a home in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Next year. </seg>

<seg id="1014"> The one they may be, the other, they want to get rid of very quickly: Krähen belong to the erased from for centuries, but in many local authorities are more frequent Anwohnerbeschwerden on dirt and noise of the animals. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> It is a remedy for the “ Problemvögel ” has so far not in sight. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Saatkrähen are from the cities not to get out more, experts said the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen Leer. </seg>

<seg id="1259"> Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book “ beauty and a history of the First World War, told in nineteen destinies ” with a long list of main people who contribute to a to heart. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> Here, a piece of advice about how we could: you are raising this side of caution and you make it to your Lesezeichen. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> You will see these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well to get to know each other, and these protagonists than your GPS function, as the beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and lost your illusions are deprived of. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Peter Englund is a swedish historian and journalist. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> He has an unusual book written, which he did not incorrect as “ a work of the anti - history ”. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather “ a book about how it was. ” it is about “ emotions, impressions, experience and moods. ” </seg>
<seg id="1267"> “ Beauty and the experience of war of terror ” almost 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, Krankenwagenfahrer and clerks. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Some of these people to be heroes. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Some are prisoners of war, to lose Gliedmaße, be crazy or die. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Each of these lives truce as Votivkerzen in a church that some will add, while others fade away. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Englunds book is different from the usual history books. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> It also revised the idea, the First World War was just the devastating entrenched position in the Westfront. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> “ Beauty and horror ” moves with Expertenblick on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, of East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> On the soldiers in this book, a fall Bienenkörbe celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> This is almost from the beginning, a very moving book. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> The war has flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina, the following Kordit smell. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> Imagine you are a woman who at home with their children, and the cannon &apos;s fire in the distance, you hear or take the flight? </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Who is at all? </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war in the first place. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> “ A lack of facts, ” Englund said that “ were on assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, hare - brained ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares, rumours treaty. ” </seg>
<seg id="1281"> “ Beauty and horror ” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard root, a young german Schiffsmatrosen. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other things have already published material removed. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> Your Lebensberichte can be terrifying or simple, but they are very alive in Englunds the details in that collection of small moments. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Many of them act of shortage and Behelfen. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> In the history of a german Schulmädchens tells it: “ a substitute, replacing everywhere. ” </seg>
<seg id="1286"> “ Ersatzkaffee aluminium, wrong, wrong, eraser Papierverbände, Holzknöpfe. ” </seg>
<seg id="1287"> He told more of the Ersatzessen in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> He describes “ the meat from large compressed and rice cooked in Hammelfett (and least with a false bones from wood served), tobacco, from dried agricultural roots and dried Kartoffelschalen, shoes, with wood besohlt. ” </seg>
<seg id="1289"> There was, as he noted, “ 837 Nahrungsersatzmittel registered in the manufacture of hot dogs were allowed, 510 - registered Kaffeeersatzmittel. ” </seg>
<seg id="1290"> Some stories act of honour and bravery. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> An American acknowledges its own rush towards the ferocity and says of the war: “ one feels that in spite of everything that is, more for men than in Lehnstuhl to sit with the Abendblatt or the best - seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and to do so, as such a façade of civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind the own strengthened and beschlagenen Hemdbrust. ” </seg>
<seg id="1292"> Conversely, a british soldier recognises that it is likely to die, and no one notice or would be done. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> “ If you by the idea of self - sacrifice, is backing away, you would think that this is happening in front of an audience, ” he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Instead it is so terrible as “ a convicted man who was hanged in secret. ” </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Other observations act of the old Europe, the fall apart, and on new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> “ The conflict has been a growing economic competition, ” writes Englund, “ a war between the factories. ” </seg>
<seg id="1297"> He catches the arrival of a what he “ a new species in the Bestiarium the young century ”: “ the word - looking and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick, the slaughter, while he is sitting behind a desk. ” </seg>
<seg id="1298"> People behave to unforeseen way and there is also frivoles behaviour such as heroic acts. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively trying to a prostitute with a Geschlechtskrankheit contagion to the Frontdienst to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> “ The bizarre expression can trade with Gonokokken - Eiter discovered, as soldiers and bought their genitals grease, in the hope that the way to enter the hospital to come ”, he writes. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> “ Those who really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which led to them the rest of their lives were blind. ” </seg>
<seg id="1302"> In this translation from a Peter Graves will Englunds poetry and elastic but intrusiveness and fit perfectly in his human task. </seg>

<seg id="1362"> The union, the hundreds of Schulbetreuern, the last month have lost their jobs, representing the city on Wednesday, is planning to sue, because the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence in schools, the poor students, not necessary and discriminatory. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The complaint is probably the last chance, the local council in the trade union, 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, still is open. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer Betreuungskoordinatoren, and other staff members, who are the worst paid employees of the city and were on October 7, in a move that had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for that last year the city &apos;s access to a Gesundheitsfond, the working groups, had denied the Haushaltslücke should be closed. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> The allegations were made by the authorities rejected outright. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> At a hearing of the council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, last month, the redundancies are part of the budget that passed in June. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> A member of the City Council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that staff Schulhilfe will be made redundant. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Officials of the council 37 said that they had, and warned the Education Ministry in a complaint. on Wednesday it will give a press conference, at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan, formally announced. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> The application will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of the city as a defendant, eight laid - off workers as the plaintiff, all of which are non - white or latin american women, as most of the workers who have lost their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of the city, said that the city was not the case and therefore could not comment on their individual claims. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> According to a Klageentwurfs, of the New York Times, the trade union has on the number of job losses at schools in the slums of the city, a legal case for discrimination to support claims that poor schools more workers would have lost, as they are chronically underfunded. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> It points out that, while there is no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools&apos; s Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 Schulhelfer in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost 46 and aid workers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> With the observation by the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern, 36 in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, “ this is not a neighborhood - wealthy parents who can organise donations to budget cuts. ” </seg>
<seg id="1374"> P. S.: the budget of the 36th district, this year has been to 3,26 per cent cut. addition, lost money, the city of their method of calculating the Extrafinanzierung for each Armenschuleneinschreibung changed. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The union also complained that the head of the High - all with the language in a memo in the bottle, which led to the dismissal of the Betreuungskoordinatoren approved. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> The memo used the word “ excess ”, to describe the act, even if “ excess ” (german): send in the United States usually the change of practitioners of the payroll a school in a pool of available workers to describe the central office will be paid for. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> “ Sechsundsechzig Betreuungskoordinatoren have been laid off, not to, ” says the Klageentwurf. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya </seg>
<seg id="1379"> At the end of the day, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington, already on the uprisings in Libya to communicate. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long - time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the american interference. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate a resolution, which the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), and Libya is for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their “ courage ” praises. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> “ This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya, with the reconstruction of the country have begun, ” said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> “ This is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties. ” </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The language may sound was innocent, but so far nothing easy in the Libya debate. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> This summer arguing legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya - the NATO mission. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution, which the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya approved. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The law has been in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties rejected and there was no vote. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> But on the same day, this law in the Senate and the House by overruling a decision to cut money for american operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> As a result, the US mission in a kind of purgatory legislative - with a Congress that found enough, Obama &apos;s approach in the context of the mission to criticize, but not angry enough to him once the rug from under their feet. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Then the indecision of Congress overtaken by events. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Tripoli fell in August, among the libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> Now the Senate may be willing to take action. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The resolution of the Committee for international relations “ congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and perseverance of the extraordinary in its self - liberation ” and “ commends the men and women of the US military and its coalition partner, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their exceptional courage and professionalism. ” </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The resolution also “ reaffirmed the national interests of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy. ” </seg>
<seg id="1396"> Will the new measures the full support of the board to foreign relations received or are they the legislators divide the law in June, has done? </seg>
<seg id="1397"> The latest version to the opposing the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the leaders of the Republican Committee. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> Lugars spokesman said on Monday that it has the final version of the new law have not seen. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> According to Capitol Hill, the onus is on the Senate, this week on a constitutional change that a balanced budget that calls for a top priority in almost every Kongresslegislaturperiode of Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to be time to vote in the Senate or the Congress. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Other legislators have so far failed to do so, the changes are being put to the vote, even though they are often enough tried. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes, which were presented this Congress and a whole range of subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> Some are twice - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate before other soft only slightly. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> There are alone in the Senate at least 15 versions of the Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung and another dozen, the “ federal control ”. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their customers, especially rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast about that any such action “ written ”. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which in August was adopted, that requires both Senate and Congress on a revision of the Haushaltsausgleichs vote. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> In March, 58 senators for a non - binding resolution that favour the idea of such a change. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> On the budget, to some members of the number of the rules, the members of Congress can come up with that limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York) the limit of two terms in office, the president wants to tear up. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> The Republicans Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes, including the right to a good education and health care. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> An amendment, a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen bans, as well as an alteration to the burning of flags from a recurring presentation. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> Some legislators also want the removal of federal laws when two thirds of the states vote against it. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> So keen, as the members suggest changes, so poorly they move more quickly, as in previous years. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> In the 111th Congress, legislators 77 such changes in 110. Congress 66. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> The pace of pales in comparison with that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly more than 150 proposed changes every two years, so the figures that the Senatsbibliothek available. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But they were also not much more successful than today &apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> The last change that needs to be added to the 27 -, was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already in 1789, the Congress proposed. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> “ Getroffen, but not defeated, ” Giffords in the first television interview after the attack </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Ten months after an armed man from close distance while canvassing in Tucson shoot at them, the Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday night on national tv and sang the only Broadway - piece of “ the Sun wants to come out tomorrow ” and said that the desire to recover, is greater than the in the Congress to return. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> Alongside Diane Sawyer of ABC News “ 20 / 20 ”, after fighting words and needed assistance walking. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> The program showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet, the shared her skull, the left - hand side of your brain durchbohrt and its head, from start to finish, crosses, has caused. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Three months ago, she returned surprising in the Congress to triumphantly their voice in debt. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 were wounded, smiling, Gifford laughed and sang and described her recovery as “ difficult ”. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> When Sawyer asked her how they feel, said Gifford (41): “ quite well. ” </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one - hour “ 20 / 20 ” - Specials, shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple was recorded: “ Gabby: a story of courage and hope. ” </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> In the videos, Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in his hospital bed, with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on the forehead. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> You can only one or two finger, if her husband encouraged. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while their therapists, showing them how simple movements. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> A nod of the head. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> A Zucken with the lips. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> And then, their first words: “ what. ” </seg>
<seg id="1432"> After a few days of whispering Giffords another word: “ toast ” and you would like to see their breakfast is changed. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> In the video, the NBC show took place, show that music has an important role in Giffords&apos; recovery played: you see, such as the members of Congress, along with the therapist to Cyndi Laupers “ Girls Just Wanna have fun, ” and Tom Pettys “ Free Fallin ” sings. ” </seg>
<seg id="1434"> In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords, the two hours every day with therapy needs to go to the day of the attack cannot remember. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Her husband said that it was Giffords on March 12, a daily newspaper in an article on the attack had read it off, and for the first time after the six people asked during the attack had been killed. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and will forcibly treated while he was on trial is waiting. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> “ Many people are dead, ” Giffords told Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> “ Tough, tough, tough. ” </seg>
<seg id="1439"> In the course of his wife, Kelly told Sawyer, she said: “ I have been taken. ” </seg>
<seg id="1440"> “ So, I would say, “ Gabby, you cannot be defeated ”?, ” said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You will only be taken. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> And you will get through this and you will you recover and you will come back stronger than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Troops feel sympathy rather than respect </seg>
<seg id="1444"> The event was a Wall Street - Gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> On cue, collected a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> “ The servicemen and women have been seen as a hero, ” said David Saltzman, the Spendenaktion organised in the spring. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, on the Stabchef and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> “ They were introduced as orphans, ” the officer wrote in an e - mail. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I am sure that the organisers have meant well. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I know that. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> But it was no respect, not really, it was sympathy for them. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring american public. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> The troops are showered with praise for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> But the praise has its price, say Dienstangehörige. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> The public is acting increasingly, as do the people in uniform of suffering. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> “ We were not sacrifice, ” said Brigade General B. Sean MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan soon after. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> “ But it seems that the only way the support of one of us in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate. ” </seg>
<seg id="1460"> The issue is particularly sensitive for military leaders, not ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve, seem to want. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> They have also recognized that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War clothed, much worse. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> As a result there are discussions about compassion on the quiet and private between war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> After his two sons from fighting with the marines have returned, warned the Colonel (a. D. Mark Cancian them from that people outside the world of their military service from two different perspectives could see. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> Some of them with a sense of awe, since they rebels defeated and to exotic places have visited. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Others wonder whether a “ angry, violent veteran under the surface, ” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return, a senior Staatsposten in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly erfragten, whether he was unable to immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> “ If you talk about your service, they must be the negative impressions argue, ” declared Cancian his sons. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> The lack of ease of the military is rooted in a lack of interest on the part of the Americans in the war. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Services on the battlefield, a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is rarely as praise singled out. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> “ We as a nation estimate military heroism is not more so, as it has been in the Second World War was normal practice, ” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Instead, the focus of the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> Troops find recognition for the number of attacks, they are suffering, the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> The military is the increasing pressure to crack down on rape </seg>
<seg id="1474"> This week to decide an important hearing about whether 28 men and women because of non - intervention in a rape before the military court to be charged. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Elizabeth Obergefreite Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped at night by a Soldatenkollegen. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego, the dinner with a friend, as a male colleagues, who was the one 12er Pack beer in itself. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> He asked her whether to accompany a drink in their rooms. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> “ My alarm bells to, ” said Lyman. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> I thought: “ no, no, he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> He is from Texas, ” she said. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> “ I wish I had on my gut instincts. ” </seg>
<seg id="1484"> A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and they were raped, it claims. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> This week, on 18 November, wait Lyman and 27 other current and former Militärangestellte anxious to a trial with an historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a charge against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, have to be in court are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not widespread rape in the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D. C., comprised of the lawsuit initially 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of which claim that they are of Soldatenkollegen raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or a reasonable case law after the alleged attacks to provide. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Burke says it is monitoring the supreme military command, because the problem there will begin. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> “ The military is hierarchical ”, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> “ But who are the individuals in the position, the culture of retribution to eradicate the lead. ” </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Burke also says that since February, it has been in contact with almost 400 more survivors, many of them may be part of future claims. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> Your strategy: instead of claimants, so to speak, for all their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many more complaints to submit to keep up the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> The team of defence for the Department of Defense, led by Bundesstaatsanwalt Neil MacBride, has made a request for legal action. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The files of the court, the Newsweek, lead, in detail, the defense to, first of all, that the military does not of current or former soldiers for injuries can be tried in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> Because of a law of the Supreme Court in the 1950s, the so - called “ Feres Doctrine, there is the government not for injury, which is in active service, the soldiers to be added. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> “ The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs, ” says the document. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> The Department of Defense refused any comment on this story. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If women are still not to the service in the fight are permitted, it is only on behalf of the distinction: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams play by female soldiers increasingly important roles, especially in the contact links with local women in the war zones. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The result: between the two wars died 150 soldiers, two - thirds of them in hostilities. </seg>
<seg id="1502"> It is time for the military modernisation, says Burke. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And it is in their fight not alone: three further apart from their complaints are pending. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> At Yale Law School, the veteran ” Legal Services Clinic lawsuit against the four main military academies, because of alleged promoting a hostile atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> This independent collects the not - for - profit Vietnam veteran of America a legal case against the military government, to be the diagnosis “ personality disorder ”, the rape victims received it from the service to a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati, the Service Women &apos;s Action Network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Her group, in December, a complaint against the veteran Administration (, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in dealing with entitlements for people accusing felt, in the service of sexually abused. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, a number of leads. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (, Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse), Department of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> But the majority of abuses are not registered at all and the estimate of the Pentagon &apos;s own account of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases, on the face of it a year. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The report, which was published in March, also investigates the Strafverfolgungsraten: 2010 came 20 per cent of recorded cases in the military in a court of law, only half as many as in the civil law. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> The plaintiffs in Burke &apos;s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> In case they Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> That night, she says, she was 11 times, asked the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and military commanders to tell. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> You had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was by a judge heard. during this hearing, it was after the sex asked before the attack with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Six people said as Charakterzeugen on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of will, in the end, was acquitted. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> “ I remember the day when the verdict was read out, ” Lyman says. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> “ I thought that would go into labor. I ran screaming from the courtroom. ” </seg>
<seg id="1519"> “ They brought me to the psychiatric unit and I remember that I, when I came out again, to my commander said that was not his trial. that was my procedure. ” </seg>
<seg id="1520"> Lyman has been asked to visit Militärpsychiater will, in the end, a personality disorder diagnosed and for dienstunfähig said. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> In January 2010, she was dishonourable, so that they do not support. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Whether the complaint that the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> However, it says: “ I believe they are making progress. ” </seg>
<seg id="1524"> What between them and a verdict is, is this doctrine, criticised the will, for the first time, was called into question. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> I am a critic throughout their life the Feres Doctrine. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> The military is still lagging behind a decade later, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence, the liability. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> He adds: “ the odds are against them … but it is important for them to try. ” </seg>
<seg id="1528"> These things will only change, if good people are ready to fight. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> If the item is not hearing their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> “ We are going to the military, in this regard, continue to fight until reforms ”, she says. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Or until we die, whatever the first. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Walls have eyes: how researchers see you on Facebook </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Before the new face of the right - wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, just one of many boys who their anti - Einwanderungsmeinung online broadcast. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> Despite Breivik acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has a great deal of time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, the extreme right - wing groups on the part of social support networks. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> After the tragedy of this past summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> But, as we find them? </seg>
<seg id="1538"> This is easy, you only have to connect on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> “ We have found that it was not difficult, to go to them, ” says Jamie Bartlett, the Hauptautor a recent report of the british Ideenfabrik DEMOS, on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Facebooks hide - and - seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch Bartlett, says that the researchers simply Werbetool the side have to use their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy decide exactly - as retailers have done for years. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> Bartletts team found half a million fans of far - right groups throughout Europe and visierte it with Adds, but rather than with a new band or a new Diätprodukt to effect, invited the Adds users to a survey in which after their level of education, their attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future was asked. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues in the situation, more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right - wing parties in 11 european countries to question - without even to her office would have to leave. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> “ It is a fairly new research method, ” says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Some of the results come as a surprise hardly. online promoter of far - right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> But in a kind of surprising distortion, “ those who make their online activism with an off - line activism combine sensible, democratic and less violent than those who are behind their computer screens to sit still. ” </seg>
<seg id="1546"> DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is a new tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and political scientists use the hand, study it all, of health issues to Gesellschaftstrends as in “ Likes ”, text messages and Statusaktualisierungen. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> With more than 800 million active users, on average, three content per day add, generated Facebooks “ Datensupernova ” a Forschungsboom, the number of scientific work by the name of this side of the title in the last five years, almost 800% increase. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that this side of people studying, usually with his Clipboard on the road is not achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> “ If he had previously tried to people of the British National Party to ask, it was very difficult to identify them. ” </seg>
<seg id="1551"> “ You had to inform the first of the party and they never would have access to, ” says Bartlett. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> “ Facebook is everything away, you will go directly to them. ” </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Others say that the side offers an opportunity to social health problems to identify and resolve. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who their Vollrausch on Facebook, significantly more than the Problemtrinken tend to students who remained silent on the issue. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> Moreno is proposing that equal students, for example, the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they make many Statusaktualisierungen postet. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> “ You can &apos;t solve a problem if you have not heard of, ” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co - author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development on Children&apos; s Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> “ We have found an opportunity to vulnerable children to identify the, not been found. ” </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Facebook zapft also constantly the data of its own people. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> The Datenteam the side has statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentine &apos;s Day, turnout in the 2010 mid - term elections, and a National Glücksindex produced (and the first data have been used on the all - access Facebook has perfected the digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great Datenfundgrube for other for research purposes, to make.) </seg>
<seg id="1560"> But the users of Facebook, know that the side observed them, whether they want it or not, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allowed one of the side &apos;s own personal data auszubringen. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey, from which they do not even know about? </seg>
<seg id="1562"> While researchers have strict guidelines laid down as to how they collect data offline to online is allowed to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> “ I do not believe that many users at all reflecting on the fact that researchers could study their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he public sides of students on Facebook investigated. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> “ What it is, it was only for them and their friends. ” </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Then there is the question of methodology. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Even offline, there is no guarantee that a Forschungsteilnehmer absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a Nutzerprofil and in speeches are true. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> “ What you on Facebook says and what is outside of Facebook, are two different things, ” says Selwyn. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as Technologieforscher that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best Forschungswerkzeuge is that everyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> “ There is no substitute for the real world and with real people to talk to, ” he says. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> “ Social research to turn to the social care and a lot of social life is still offline. ” </seg>
<seg id="1572"> “ Cold and inhumane ”: in other Behring Breivik appears to be the first time a public court </seg>
<seg id="1573"> In other Behring Breivik, the man, the two Amokläufe, in which this summer in Norway 77 people have been killed, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a “ resistance fighters described. ” </seg>
<seg id="1574"> “ I am a Militärkommandeur in the norwegian resistance movement and a Tempelritter Norway, ” he said before a court with more than 500 people. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> “ I object to the court, because your mandate of organizations have received the Hassideologien support and because it has the support of multiculturalism. ” </seg>
<seg id="1576"> “ I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty. ” </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Judges Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he “ Breivik, not the possibility of wanted to give this hearing as a platform to use on his views. ” </seg>
<seg id="1578"> For the same reason, he refused to Breivik wrote in advance of a speech mitbrachte, permits to at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 weeks in custody, he retains four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks will be closely monitoring. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Some arrived in the hope that Breivik in the eye can see, some wanted to the confirmation that he was behind bars. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> All took part, with the aim of everything on a Wegschließen. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> “ I thought he looks cold and inhumane ”, told a survivor of Utoya the norwegian broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> “ It was uncomfortable, but for me, it is a bit, when I saw and heard the suspect. ” </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted throughout the hearing, he looked calm and professional journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> In spite of Breiviks bizarrem saying that he would be part of a larger “ resistance ” movement, the judges came to the conclusion that he is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It may be for some that the attacks on 22 July what appears to be the work of an individual was not the extremists and a group of radical. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> But making it easier to automatically the sadness and the confusion that an entire nation still feels? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> “ I wish that he sees as a monster, but it does not, ” said the members of a victim. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> “ It would be so much easier if he did. ” </seg>
<seg id="1591"> 7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, this week in a theatre was shown </seg>
<seg id="1592"> After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some of it with Henry Ford and raised the Technikgenie as a large, modern inventors. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> What Apple &apos;s fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs - interview, which this week in particular Filmvorführungen on the major markets dusted off, is how much the creative head networking and routines understood. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self - appointed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the eager to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who thought that many managers in “ a disease of thought ”, “ a really great idea 90 per cent of the total work … [but] there is a huge amount of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product. ” </seg>
<seg id="1595"> Bob Cringely 1995 developed the tv series “ triumph of Fachidioten ” as a result of the personal computer, and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs, in one of the rare, detailed talks led. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> At that time, and 10 years since jobs from Apple. and he has already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was on the broad adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> While a small part of Cringleys interview in Fachidioten has been used, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of the interview in the supply were missing. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> Jobs death only after it was also found that a full copy of VHS - in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> This slightly revised film footage that forms the basis for the 68minütigen film “ Steve Jobs: the Lost, ” the interview this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark - theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> For someone who is well - known for detailed interviews detests seems surprisingly busy jobs here in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> And incredibly interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> In the course of the interview, it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen, in which jobs clearly weighed up his ideas and accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are also moments when jobs, ” perfect to days when he apparently impatient Cringelys responded to questions and anschubst more quickly with issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included seems the lost interview somehow incredibly far - sighted, if jobs assessed what other companies believes is right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is one thing to posthumous awards the career jobs ” to read, but jobs here as the greedy dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> He has a vision of how things might be and should be. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Just after he has said all had, and he made it. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews: </seg>
<seg id="1609"> As he learned to do business: </seg>
<seg id="1610"> “ Throughout the years in the business, I always ask: “ why are you doing things? ” and the answer that you always have, is: “ oh, so it will be easy. ” </seg>
<seg id="1611"> No one knows why he is doing what he is doing, no one in the business think very carefully about things. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I have found. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> Jobs his efforts on the accounting for Apple to streamline. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> Perplexed, such as cost record - usually began with “ Standardkosten ” at the mere suggestion put out, and then with the “ anomaly ” - it developed the automated factory, who ensured that the Geschäftskosten to micromanage being identified. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> As the Pope veralbert: </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Jobs told of the “ blue boxes ” that he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device which we have been in the telephone company slip and long - distance calls for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> On the device much has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm, the blue as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box, making it a gebührenpflichtiges phone use, and then make a phone call from an AT &amp;amp;amp; T network to another, while so many satellites as possible durchschleifen. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> “ We sent about a half - dozen times around the globe and if we telephone grölte, there was a minute later in the telephone next door out ”, tells kichernd jobs. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> “ We were young and we learned that we ourselves can make something that billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world can control. ” </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing, which is a huge thing can control, that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them, Apple would be. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> Jobs told further away from a glorious gimmick, the Wozniak and he almost pulled out, as they are in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican phoning and with the Pope wanted to talk, while it as best they could, Henry Kissinger nachmachten. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> As several members of the catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night, have been called in to deal with the american diplomats, had the two loslachen before the Pope himself up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> As he has been in the technology verliebte (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called): </seg>
<seg id="1625"> At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, in order to build a Frequenzzähler, seeking to Bill Hewlett in telephone directory and called on it to. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Shortly after her 20 - minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part - time at Hewlett - Packard. </seg>
<seg id="1627"> “ This has had a remarkable influence on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated. ” </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Later, Jobs one of the HP - the research laboratory of the company in Palo Alto, where he visited “ the first &apos;s desktop computers, ever made ”. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher Röhre and I verliebte me in it. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> I would, if HP as a teenager and climb to the top of this machine, and programmes, they write. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> How innovation improved: </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Several times in the interview talking about jobs and about how to spontaneously inventing new products. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Early in his career, when he some einbaute situation, he was asked by a customer, the whole computers assemble them. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> He was working with a payment of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the ready - made equipment drawing board. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Later on, Apple he will recall the problems in the development of a Computermaus: </seg>
<seg id="1636"> “ I remember very strong arguments … they screamed at me, that it would take five years to a mouse to build the $300 would cost] and I went out and found a manufacturer. ” </seg>
<seg id="1637"> 90 days later we had a mouse, for $15 to construct. that was amazing credible. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On large companies that continue: </seg>
<seg id="1639"> Long before he revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in stumbling and control over their shares lost. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> “ We say, you are working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better Kopierer or printers, so what? ” </seg>
<seg id="1641"> You have the Aktienmonopol, so is the company was more successful. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Sales and marketing make it successful, so there are such people [are] at the end of the day, the companies and the product, with which the people from the decision - making process. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> The Produktgenie, which led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products, wiped out - Handwerkskunst necessary. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> That happened in Xerox … </seg>
<seg id="1645"> Xerox had all the computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> We have ten times more can be, the Microsoft of the 1990 &apos;s can be … </seg>
<seg id="1647"> You have the defeat by the victory. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> About innovation as an art form. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> “ It &apos;s a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product … if this great idea, they are changing and growing. ” </seg>
<seg id="1650"> We are learning a lot about its nuances. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> It must be votes, certain things that you can &apos;t do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> We must see 5,000 terms, these concepts, and all of them together … </seg>
<seg id="1653"> In the end, it amounts to the taste, what it comes down to is that we try to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to these matters to the together, what you do. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> We are always shamelessly steal in the grand ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> Part of what makes Macintosh great was made, that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> It would not be in the computer business, they would have been in other areas of fantastic things. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the Gesundheitsgesetze, as a court case takes </seg>
<seg id="1659"> On the same day that the Supreme Court behind closed doors to the politically teilende question about whether it is a challenge to the Gesundheitsgesetze by President Obama will hear, made two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and finally there is Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the Chancellery gesponsort, that was the case in court. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges are meeting to discuss met on the petitions for consideration. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> One of the cases handled an appeal by the 26 states against the far - reaching reform of the healthcare system, the last year by Congress approved a law in the conservative activists across the United States on the slogan. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> The judge agreed with the hearing on; indeed, in March, a 5 1 / 2 - hour Grundlagendiskussion expected, probably the result will probably boost the Präsidentschaftskampf 2012, at the time, in which the court &apos;s decision is made public, will be in full swing. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The lawyer, the courts, and will maintain that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, Attorney General once under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Clements&apos; s cabinet, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies, the annual dinner of the federalist society, a veteran group, which the defence of conservative principles. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Another was the sponsor Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the enormous process is involved. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> The dinner was held a few hours after the court on the debate, in a Washington hotel. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, America &apos;s the Fraktionschef of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health - care reform </seg>
<seg id="1669"> The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years events the federalist society. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> And it is not against moral rules. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> In fact, the judges by the code of conduct, free of the actions of the lower Bundesrichter. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> They were there, they might well under the principle 4c Code, which states: “ a judge can get near law and other organisations to take part, and the judge, according to a spokesman for guest or programme does not a guest, such events. ” </seg>
<seg id="1674"> Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the with the case of related practices, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this, morality - and - Regierungsaktivisten alert. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> “ The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code gives the complaints by some judges lie, the court seems to play by the same rules for all other Bundesrichter apply, ” said Bob Edgar, President of the common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> “ The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trials at the court. ” </seg>
<seg id="1677"> Your attitude and their support for this event a Spendenaktion undermine any right to impartial and are not acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics, who say they are Gerichtsangelegenheit too easily with groups that are off the agenda, such as the federalist society, mix. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And the wife, Ginni Thomas ” is a well - known conservative activist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> However, the Conservatives that Judge Elena Kagan was a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> Kagan was Generalstaatsanwältin under the Obama administration, when the first Gesetzesanfechtungen in the first instance in court. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Your critics urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias to withdraw because they are too much in defending the law committed to be impartial. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Kagan is not about to do that. </seg>

<seg id="1749"> Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible cuts in the defence </seg>
<seg id="1750"> Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he is warned that automatic budget cuts will weaken national security unnoticed, he delivered a financial chain reaction in the halls of the Pentagon &apos;to the battlefields of Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The Pentagon has already carefully cuts to the tune of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts to $600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress does not end up in the spending. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> “ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung, leading to a so - called seizure, would lead to 23% across - the - board cuts and an end to many new projects. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> “ Such a high level of reduction, carried out in such ill - considered way, most of our ship - building projects and unviable, you can not three - quarters of a ship or buy a building and other efforts to modernize seriously harm, ” Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> “ We would also be forced to part us from a large part of our civilian staff to separate and, since the reduction as soon would be implemented, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, the goal is to be achieved. ” </seg>
<seg id="1756"> “ These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage. ” </seg>
<seg id="1757"> The cuts were, in the end, the combat forces take, ” said Panetta. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> “ While the Kriegszeitkontingente in the war on terrorism, by the seizure are not directly affected, the serious interference in the Grundbudget the Kriegsbemühungen adversely affect, ” Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> “ Recruitment were to be cut back, leading to delays in the attitudes and the Einstellungsaufsicht, supporting the war. ” </seg>
<seg id="1760"> “ The salaries of the staff would be cut, with late payments to Kriegszeithändler leads and the legal and political support would be disrupted. ” </seg>
<seg id="1761"> The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> “ The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would be a rapid decline of the United States as the world &apos;s leading military power in the world. ” </seg>
<seg id="1763"> “ We are strongly against these draconian action, ” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, they Panettas letter published. </seg>

<seg id="1765"> “ The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed. ” </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure on a compromise on the budget will increase or demands will increase the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, even though he has many years of experience in the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he was the head of the Pentagon &apos;came, and I know that he is facing tough decisions. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> At a press conference last week, the defense minister malte a gloomy picture, which might face a military shell, but without a core. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> “ It is an air - without enough trained pilots. ” </seg>
<seg id="1772"> “ It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are in a position to the mission, ” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> “ It is a force of morality and alert and is not in a position to provide it with potential opponents. ” </seg>
<seg id="1774"> “ You can be a really angry. ” </seg>
<seg id="1775"> In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led Panetta new details, such as reductions of “ significant operational risks creating: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global work and Eingreiffähigkeit, leading to an unacceptable risk in future Kriegsoperationen leading. ” </seg>
<seg id="1776"> And Panetta said that some of the biggest Verteidigungsprojekte the removal could fall victim, including those that already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> That list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a proposed new Bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new Bodenkampffahrzeug, the Army and Navy, in need of the Humvee to replace. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> The further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years, up to save $80 billion, but the supporters say, an important next step in the build - up is, so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> How a lie exposed </seg>
<seg id="1780"> A look at today &apos;s headlines shows how serious and widespread fraud and lie in day - to - day life. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The republican nominee for president, Herman Cain, is busy, and allegations of sexual harassment by several women Mr. both sides accuse each other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The leadership of Penh State is the Meineids accused, since they are supposedly reports has withheld, under which a retired Footballtrainer sexually abused young boys. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> In the last week has been on an open microphone mitangehört, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the US President Barack Obama to claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Lies destroy careers, shaking countries. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he Verleugnungen - the very quickly by incontrovertible evidence refuted. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> The former presidential candidate John Edwards is the violations in the Kampagnenfinanzierung accused in connection with the cover - up of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> And then, of course, no one forgets that it has experienced the media circus, the President Bill Clinton, when he during his second term in office in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> There have been incidents in which teachers to their students the Prüfungsantworten set so that they themselves in their Leistungsüberprüfungen well launched. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Mentors, the opposite teach should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> How much deception we see? </seg>
<seg id="1792"> As studies show, lie us every day between 10 and 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Many of these lies, but as lies. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting of lying to us. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Lies to see or “ lies ” is a highlight, to learn for every human being is important, both for personal and also for professional reasons. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> Far from a parlor game such as Scharaden away, where the goal is, “ who you! ”, this is a deception Enttarnen a serious knowledge, based on scientific data over the past six decades of prestigious universities have been collected, the wide - ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> The result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies exposed. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> Lies a look in the eye. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> You stottern, suffused with zappeln stammeln, and not always. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> This may, however, are not that this liar difficult to detect and expose. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, when he heard about the structure of the claim, the subtle Gesichtsausdrücke, and timing is learning. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> I have a couple of years spent the scientific results of the broad and ever - growing area of the passport to investigate, and it is clear that the Enttarnen a deception a modern ability is easy to understand, and we in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world helps, especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> Good liar are very good, other people to assess their interests and their own emotions to dominate and they intuitively sense that other perceived to be. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> Thanks to the research, we know the extrovertierte people more often than people lying introvertierte that men are more likely to have “ selbstorientierte ” lies serving up than women, whose lies more in other “ follow ” - in the rule so that they want to protect the feelings that married people lying to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell lies, are usually “ fat ”). </seg>
<seg id="1805"> We also know that, if a person has been exposed as a culprit, others are less feel guilty, this person to have lied. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> As you can see whether someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="1807"> The first, by the normal behaviour that person. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> This is known as the “ Baselining ”, the starting point. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It is a point of reference for the future assessment of changes. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> You are watching the attitude, the laughter, the Stimmqualität their trial. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> You should know better, when someone is normally constantly walking along, so that they do not unfairly, if it during a meetings with the foot along. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Then you look at accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> When you look at these accumulations, the alarm bells ringing, not as proof of a passport. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> People who deceive bogged down, perhaps, to try to their history, to recall, perhaps, their feet in the direction of the door or reject it in terms of the outcome, change their position in a significant way or show a “ relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch ”, that deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in the attitude, if all the hard questions are over. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> Asking the signal often wrongly, that a Einstellungsgespräch is over, only to this relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> You also look at the language you trial. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> By Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was killed on the live and a national search for her. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> People can also be deceptive distanzierende language: “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman … Miss Lewinsky ” or if there is a question repeated knifflige in its entirety. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Some people use “ qualifying language ” when they knifflige a question to answer is: “ now … to tell you the truth … as far as I know … in good faith. ” </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In this way, the response will be more wahrnehmend as objectively, which often set the alarm bells ringing. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> There is no Zaubermittel to Enttarnen of lies, but we can learn skills, thanks to a passport is possible. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> Thanks to these skills, anyone can fall prey to fraudsters are rare, both in the private - as in the workplace. </seg>

<seg id="2047"> Is it not a little bit of pressure from your visit? </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Some of the greatest shows that we have in the last 21 years off to have occurred in the last two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> We have a few Riesenshows in Sao Paulo played and we hope that the us fit for this concert in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Really, we have an appetite there to play. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> We love this country, we like to surf and are from the jungle enthusiastic. in favour of Costa Rica to the best country in the world. </seg>

<seg id="2054"> My friends are always on the surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. along with Mexico are excellent places to surfing. in this way, people who love the surfing, we have heard about it. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> With a look at the tour &apos;s Riesenshows with many songs. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> What do you have plans for the event in Costa Rica? </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Because that is where we never have played, we also have no borders. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> We are going to try to make the best show to give with many different songs, we want a few songs from each album and play our fans and a good variety of repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> Her repeatedly never your repertoire. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2061"> I think this is, in part, because we have nine records and more than 120 songs can play each other like. a song, so the decision as to which we will play, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> If we have two or three song, which we have not played the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and they come as a surprise to us, because they remind us of the reasons why this song &apos;s fallen, otherwise they could be forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> With this tour celebrating your twenty years of history. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> If it looks back, you find it hard to believe in your success? </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Yes, Total. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> First of all, I think that none of us has advocated once in a great rock band to play, and this for over 20 years, which looks like a dream. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We are also to this blessing and it is great to still be able to make music together. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> We love and we are thrilled to music. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> We are in luck, to the places in the world able to travel, which we have always wanted to visit again. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> Things could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> Which meant it for you, in the birth of Grunge participated actively? </seg>
<seg id="2073"> It is always a privilege to this group of large band. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> We are good with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> It is surprising and unusual, if a movement from a group of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Now and again, a band from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups at the same time from the same town. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle - group. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Sometimes we are still together. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. we look forward, still with all of them to be a friend of mine and it does us credit, part of this that have arisen Seattle - Sounds. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> It is also very unusual for a band like your with the same musicians so long zusammengeblieben. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Yes, four of us play for 21 years together and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us, this alone is much more time than many band in time. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> First of all, I think that we are all happy, still alive, and also let us care about each other. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> We are all close friend, which is why the musical ways have opened up for all the freedom to experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> A familiar to the other and the music, it could not be better. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> Your relationship with the glory has not always been easy. on the other hand, why didn &apos;thanks to your success always do what their wolltet. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> It will take place as a balance? </seg>
<seg id="2087"> The way we are up to it has been made easier to find a balance. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> We are safe, not too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to decline. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> As long as we keep in mind that the people because of the music, reminds you of the fact that you get the music and what it has set up must respect, without keen to be a famous rock star to be; that has put us in any case never interested. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The memories you have in your other Mother Love Bone? </seg>
<seg id="2091"> I think we have a very good song written at the beginning and it was great. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> We were three years a band, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had issued a record. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> We were disappointed, took so long to have, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD) with us the band built, a friend of mine when I hear a song or photographs see, I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he me laugh. it was always a pleasure to work together to laugh and on music and football and many other topics to talk. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> It was an extraordinary person and we miss him. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> The domestic bond Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> It is true that their work is aware of, in particular, Eddie Vedder and the band for the opening of selected have? </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Yes, the production sent us videos by several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer, which will certainly exciting. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Why change her the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live? </seg>
<seg id="2099"> That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> By whom you be as Bassist influenced? </seg>
<seg id="2102"> By so many + </seg>
<seg id="2103"> Among the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski … </seg>
<seg id="2104"> There are so many that I all afternoon on the Bassisten, I like to talk. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> How has it, Pearl Jam, which did Grunge to keep alive, even though it is not a fad? </seg>
<seg id="2106"> I think we all we do not feel very connected with the word “ Grunge. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> When I think about it, the band fall to me, which I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all the other came up at the same time, if they still are important, I think that is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and band as Mudhoney now make music better than ever before. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> First of all, it was their music blacker, now it is positive. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="2110"> This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album, which could prove a bit lightly, but there are also other songs as the end or just Breathe, as the song &apos;s very dark, even though they also something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> Both were in tears when I heard how Ed it played: they are very dark song. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> I believe that if you are older and a little Traumatisches in your life happens, for example, if you have a family member or a friend loses - influenced the your artistic creation and your music, and these two song embody the clear for me. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> However, I also believe that it is a happy person and still dark music. </seg>

<seg id="2187"> Park or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2188"> The architects, in addition to the bickering over the fees with the tender. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> In the mid - 1980 &apos;s, at the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> The brochure described the mountain as a huge Park in Barcelona city. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the Park, in the eyes of many again to the ceiling of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in the North - South spread, but upwards (mountains) and down (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="2194"> The classification Collserolas as natural park plays with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> As an example, served is no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> So far, it was, as the city in September a Riesenausschreibung, consisting of 16 competitions, for further Zugangstore after Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> No doubt, a gateway to the concept of a park. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Either that, or someone, gates into the country. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> The question is: Collserola, parks or mountain? </seg>
<seg id="2200"> The announcement is not only from organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city of the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste, which is in the lift, can turn. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> And it is this fact is the stuff of one of the rare common ground between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors, on the project. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> “ It is necessary for Roldán, ” after the attack on the coast on the “ front of the mountains ”, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, not pregnancy. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> “ We should start from the principle that Barcelona is the greatest Park beach. </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Among other things, because it is easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Collserola is more complex, ” judging from the architect, for the title of “ the gates of Collserola ” a “ collective ” case: we must not “ as access to a park, but as a ring - fencing of areas in which we need to act. ” </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a “ intellectual challenge, ” the “ some risks ”. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Risks from the “ uncertainty, the creation of a public space today brings with it ”, according to the experience in the 1980 &apos;s, in the area of the Forum of their “ swan song. ” </seg>
<seg id="2210"> The first fear is the limit on what must be developed. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> “ This limit always means, the next step ”, i. e. it. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> “ We must think about new urban planning tools, because the current [with reference to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can become a real catastrophe. ” </seg>
<seg id="2213"> Modol, which is close to the issue, says simplified, the side of Collserola towards Vallesana is, “ can be understood as a park, in the sense of not Barcelona ”, and for purely topografischen reasons. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Modol recalls that it has a study by the Patronat de Collserola that are not “ should fall on deaf ears, ” though he is grateful to the town hall that his body the opportunity in this project “ from the outset. ” </seg>
<seg id="2215"> In addition, it says that the proximity of the mountain to the town of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects, participate in the debate, even though he “ doubts ” to say whether this technical profile the first launched in multidisciplinary teams (“ exactly the right, ” he says “ we should guide) architects should only be a tool. ” </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, as in the offering of a global view of Collserola lacked: “ there were 16 competitions in the cross - section of advertised, ” he says, “ on the axis mountains - sea, but there are no Längsschnittperspektive the area seen in its entirety. ” </seg>
<seg id="2217"> That has, at least in his case that led it to the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architect of the Tors also clash. </seg>

<seg id="2237"> The journey - y de Secretaría Comunicaciones (SCT secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the accident, in which the Regierungssekretär Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed, point out that the helicopter with his whole structure intact directly on the ground geprallt is, without the pilot of an emergency evacuation would have. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> At a press conference said Dionisio Jácome Pérez, the secretary for communications and transport, that the pilot with the launch would have confirmed, the weather conditions are suitable for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> “ The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 - metre - level contact with trees, and the helicopter the hulls lost, appears to show that the helicopter had several Bodenkontakte. ” </seg>
<seg id="2240"> He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he has all the conditions for the transport of the staff. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> He also said that in the investigations in the area in which the machine decrepit, was not Hubschrauberteile were found. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> “ In the search, no aircraft spare parts to other areas, the surcharge was the whole structure. </seg>

<seg id="2251"> Weather conditions: </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The appropriate AICM recorded weather conditions at the start of Weiterflugs towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state drew some low - hanging clouds. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> Elected flight paths: </seg>
<seg id="2254"> It is possible that the team because of the clouds to a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley selected. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> Aufprallstelle: </seg>
<seg id="2256"> The Aufprallkoordinaten and the last of the helicopter Radaraufzeichnung agree. it might be before the impact of either a loss on the plane or a deviation from the flight. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> The scattered remains of the aircraft in a limited area: </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The right up to the present day, this information indicates that the helicopters from gerader seitlicher aufgeprallt and direction. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> The pattern of scattered Flugzeugreste suggest that the helicopter with its intact structure on the ground aufgeprallt was. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> No evidence of fire or explosion: </seg>
<seg id="2261"> The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene would not to fire or explosion. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The latest findings point to several Bodenkontakte. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In the on - site investigations were aircraft spare parts of 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is abschüssig and has a Schrägung of seven to 30 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter likely to break. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> Some information indicates that the helicopter several Bodenkontakte could have had. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> After a minuziösen search in an area that is on the field at the scene abgesperrten went beyond, could not be found scattered aircraft spare parts for the adoption of more that the bodied Flugzeugstruktur against the ground. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> MSS presents a Forschungsprotokoll for the location of the gene for obesity levels </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Mexico &apos;s Social Security Institution you is leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity among children and young people, the specialist the IPN is supported. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The Instituto del Mexicano Seguro Social - IMSS Social Security Institution (Mexico) has announced that it is a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title “ genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence, ” opens with the genetic markers associated with obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Miguel Cruz López, head of the de Unidad Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus biochemistry) to the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Nacional Médico Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, Krankenpflegern Ernährungsspezialisten, and social workers was built. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> This team will be supported by specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) Instituto Nacional del Politécnico (IPN.) </seg>
<seg id="2272"> The public is invited to take part in the study, interested parties can to sports the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 p. m. tests with children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> He stressed that the investigation on the football field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) started and since 8 October on the football field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> If the aim of 500 - 600 Untersuchungspersonen is achieved, will the study on the football field of Independencia (in the south) Hauptstadtbezirks continued and in Morelos (in the north) Hauptstadtbezirks concluded. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> He said that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said there will be three thousand seeks to ensure that children and young people in the age of six to 14 years with the understanding and under the supervision of their parents food - related to fill out questionnaires. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> You will also be questions about their physical activity, and their family Krankheitsvorgeschichte to risk factors, diabetes and renal insufficiency could lead to, to control. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> He also that these Saturdays the Untersuchungspersonen measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), their blood pressure control and Blutwerte as the Glukosespiegel, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes in connection with childhood obesity) were determined. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Cruz López pointed out, this would take place at the concern of the health service personnel on the alarming weight gain of young people. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> “ The Gesundheitsumfragen from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the percentage of obese 77 per cent of boys and girls from obesity to 47 per cent had increased, and the obesity has increased dramatically, ” said the expert of the IMSS. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> He has said that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the mexican population from the other peoples unterschiede. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> He stated that a (e) of Mexicans (in) on average to 65% indianisch - american, european and 30% to 5% of african origin is in their genes with diabetes and obesity, reflected. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> In general, he said, the genetics of obesity, the inability of the surplus to us, the prospect of Energy (calories) to burn, so that those in the form of fat stored. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The researchers said the direct benefit to put research participants would be a full investigation into the children, in the states, whether this a level of obesity or obesity. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> It would even the existence of dark Hautfalten on their backs and on Innenarm Akanthosis (), on the likelihood of Stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> All information would be kept confidential and the parents in writing from the doctors told the doctors say the parents all measurements and beat them lifestyle changes for the prevention of disease are appropriate. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Cruz López said that there would be three fundamental factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible: lack of exercise, the lack of movement in daily life, for most of the day in front of the television to spend and means of transport to use short routes, instead of walking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> The high caloric intake, in other words, an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and analysis (Tamales, bread, hamburgers, pizza, etc.), along with a high - fat and Eiweißaufnahme, as well as the field of genetics, which in this research project to be analysed. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Asphalt of the UNAM prevented bumps </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of chemistry in the mexican UNAM university developed with Polymeren Asphalte modified to the mix more resistant to weather and temperature changes to make </seg>
<seg id="2291"> In the message, the road surface, respected, would it not be necessary, nearly 200 000 bumps to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the appropriate Asphaltbelags were to happen, the number of bumps significantly reduced or even fully be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> In his presentation “ bumps from a technical point of view, ” he at the International Year of Chemistry, that he was aware that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing a similar to the asphalt mix, but more of a mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot, such as in some towns in the north of the country, should be used to the behaviour of the surface of improving the incidence of Schlaglöchern to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung is, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so - called Asphaltene - and the other is part of a low - the so - called Malthene. along the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, 120 degrees, it is very zähflüssig and almost 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures is crumbling. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> “ This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform, but one day, depending on the weather and temperature change ”, the engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> The researchers FQ said, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface, which is made up of six Materialschichten zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Between the top layers are some Verschleißschicht from asphalt, from small, in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> Every single piece of this Verschleißschicht, bathing in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> If the vehicles to travel and forces are produced, allows for this class is a good power in the road surface. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> “ If it would be modified asphalt, would the forces is even more to distribute, ” said the engineer. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> “ On the Verschleißschicht ”, he tells us, “ is a final layer, the so - called Tragschicht, from the tiny stones, i. e. of sand, also in the asphalt bathing. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Since this shift is in contact with the tyres are, they need greater force than the mechanical Verschleißschicht and friction. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> The road surface this most forces receives and distributed, needs the Tragschicht also a proper thickness and the material from which it is, will need to be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> The weather conditions, in particular, humidity and temperature, are other important factors taken into account, and above all the water, ” he said, “ because it undermines the behaviour of the Verschleißschicht considerably. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> If the terrain is wet, water in the class and is just back from difficult. created the weakening of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of Schlaglöchern. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> If a pothole ”, he said, “ will be the first Deckschicht flattened, while the Verschleißschicht only then will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that at the first sign of appropriate Wartungsprogramme maintained. ” </seg>
<seg id="2308"> The member of the Sistema Nacional de Mexico &apos;s innovation Investigadores (national) said that the Fahrzeuglast another important reason for the actions of Schlaglöchern. must therefore be the size of each layer on the surface is in relation to the Fahrzeuglast and it is important to ensure that to avoid frequent Schlaglöchern this rule will be met. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> Rafael Herrera pointed out that there are still many research would take, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries, even on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without using high temperatures repair. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> What was lacking the candidate del Valle to the new Miss Colombia? </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Analysis of the factors that impact that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia could not get. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> El Valle receives his 14. Misstitel. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> This time, Melina Ramírez Serna, on the Gewinnerpodium, a Silberkrone and the bond, which it as the new Miss Colombia, addiction. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the Zeder in itself, is already on the &apos;s Department of 14 Misstitel and Melina is linked to the legion of Valle del Cauca, the crown almost in the hands of. proclaimed to the Misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The big question that arises today, many are asking is: what was lacking? </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Because the result is in line with the decline of a large, the favorite in each trial had shown that they have everything for the new Miss Colombia. will not be in vain to Queen of the police force and for Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue was elected to the title, the Schönheitsköniginnen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The first factor that is as crucial for the decision by the jury, the first Miss to appoint, is that it is the answer to the question, “ what kind of book, you most and why? ” from Murillo Martín Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, who were not convinced. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> The young woman from the author of Valle del Cauca replied: </seg>
<seg id="2320"> “ I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of a civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book, most of my childhood, the “ small ” Prince is a very deep book. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> At the moment I read “ guilt and atonement. ” it is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a russian girl, a wonderful book, “ passions&apos; says. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> A response that did not like, firstly because of the term “ civilise &apos;and secondly, because it was not specific, had declared in what way each of her book, “ they had. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, calm and to feel happy with the result, “ the universe is wise, it is done and what has to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> And for all the people ask: lest a little “ small Prince. ” it is a great book. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is high. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the Bevorzugte, all of which Beifälle einheimste and in the run - up to all get prices (catering competition, Oster Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte dressed and Reina Madre), “ the other candidates are jealous had made, what the Queen stresste, which therefore on the stage not shine. ” </seg>
<seg id="2327"> And it noted in her first presentation to the swimming on the shore of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the Krönungsfeier. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> Although they both appeared safe, but it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of the Magdalena and Atlántico displayed. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme “ Como en Casa ” in the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina to been crowned Miss, “ shows that the candidate, the competition during the most prices wins, ultimately not Queen ”. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> Valle was also at the end of the press from the way - a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> Another hypothesis is that the Valle Jurie about their interest in the social work not convince, which ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> There must be a reason that two days before the make - up of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who is the social affairs of their country. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> “ Beauty alone is enough for Miss Colombia. we need to look beyond the Körperliche, focusing on the social sense to focus on the fact that they are already taking part in the competition had worked on projects, ” she said. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis, is in the Magengegend said, had sinned. but this is inconsistent, because the jury chose it as a candidate for “ natural beauty ” with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> The coach of the queens, Hernán Jorge Orozco, admits that Melina not the best body, that it would be better, “ but their problem with the fibrosis in the belly, which for me to be honest hard to say was, put their scoring on the last day. ” </seg>
<seg id="2336"> In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos the view that the mistake the woman of Valle del Cauca, the surgery, which they had been subjected to. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> “ Operations are: ok, but Valle did not know how they can do it properly. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Your body is never a strong side here, and she has had to pay. ” </seg>
<seg id="2339"> Because of this prize, which was the first time the national beauty contest that arose after the appearance in swimming a cruel to forecast the true in the night. it has been getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, so they do not benefit from the crown. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact is that their Herrschaftsjahr Melina from today, not as the Queen, but as a Princess, a position that will, on naming the national beauty contest Colombia in one of the international competitions. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But will it as one of the Queen, which despite its overwhelming outburst of Cartagena, escaped the crown was to go down in history. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> That was the work of the doctor, the body of Alfonso Cano identified </seg>
<seg id="2343"> A Lophoskopist from Cali, as the man who “ Alfonso Cano ” identified in history. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> The work of these officials is playing a key role. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> On November 4, a Lophoskopist the fraud investigation unit, the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who the identity of the head of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de FARC (Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: “ Alfonso Cano ” by comparing fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, had this week Eliazar González on call, a man from the Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations cooperate. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> At the beginning of his career, González was working in communities of Chocó, where he often spent five days in the jungle had to go, the place to achieve, in which the bodies that were he to identify. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> 2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses he Lophoskopie, that is the study of the skin, the friction is exposed, i. e. the hand and Fußflächen. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> In the week of the action against the so - called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out, clothing for at least three days only. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> Nothing much - awaited him. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Friday night, it flew the helicopters after Palmira of Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that was the suspicion that one of the men, the oldest of the guerrillas of the world saw, could be why it should Zehnfinger - Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
<seg id="2353"> He, however, with the Untersuchungste the place, in which the body found him, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures, which he had seen in the media, not in the slightest. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> He did not have a beard, was like a farmer dressed, the area was no glasses and was much thinner. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> But fingerprints don &apos;t lie. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a Taschenlampe Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the Abdruckblatt. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He was right: it was “ Alfonso Cano. ” </seg>
<seg id="2358"> The same night, this from Puerto Tejada, the man in charge of defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, say that there is, in fact, the head of the FARC. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> On Spurensuche </seg>
<seg id="2360"> For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali, the tribute that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference about the use of “ Cano ” against that very important. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Many people are aware of our work is not. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which is a key factor in the break - up of a crime can be. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support in murder investigations and Raubsachen and confirm the identity of those arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> When they were arrested, many criminals false papers before or they do not. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> We are taking the fingerprints and looking for this in the database. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> The researchers told us that, when it comes to a theft of a piece of wall from a house down, as the thief had just at this point with his hand aufgestützt, one with jewellery and money fully gestopften Safe herauszog. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> “ The walls are difficult, because its surface for fingerprinting are inadequate, but in this case, we were able to carry the imprint of the rest, and the criminals who participated in a number of thefts, identify, ” he reminded himself. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> With the help of the fingerprints can also Mordverdächtige or discharged. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Recently, a death surrounded by Schnapsflaschen found. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> The investigation was suspected that a family member tatverdächtig could be, and actually voted a fingerprint on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Although this is not guaranteed that it is the murderer, so it is with the place where the crime was committed, in context. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> A Daktyloskopist the CTI declared that, “ the fingerprints of chemical and physical Reagenzen taken by the object. ” </seg>
<seg id="2373"> If it appears, is a Pflanzkelle or a bond for carrying used. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> Then the prints to Asif sent, that is the Verbrecherdatenbank, or to Personenstandamt. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> “ The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented, ” declared the expert of CTI. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> He said that not everything is so, as in the tv series SCI them out to be. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> As gold is not all that glitters is also not everything that touches, a fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> But it can be used, if you have a relevant comparison. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> The “ indignant ” call on the authorities in New York out </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Hundreds of demonstrators were in tents on the &apos;s Zuccotti Square. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> A large part of the Räumungsbefehl came after and changed its location in a nearby park. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street demanded this Tuesday, the authorities in New York, when it with a court order again tried to the Manhatten - place to enter, after the morning after the place had been evacuated and have tried to another place in the Big Apple. </seg>

<seg id="2459"> The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and head of the christian democratic party, without any real difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> The future of Europe was not included in the programme, but, in the autumn of enforced, particularly those activists would be enough to make the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> In the Bureau Präsidentschaftsantrag proposed by the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> Under 1001 delegates had only nine voted against it, ten had abstained from the vote. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> The several minutes - long standing ovation, on the basis of their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro - minded finance minister, no doubt. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The Hauptidee the Chancellor, as well as the subsequent Antrage slogan: the answer to the crisis is “ not less, but more Europe. ” </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Not only because Europe peace means, but also as “ nine million jobs directly from the euro are dependent on. ” </seg>
<seg id="2466"> For the Chancellor is “ the time for a breakthrough in Europe ”. </seg>
<seg id="2467"> This could be through more control of the European Union reinforcing overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro zone to come, as well as it could, however, in the election of the president of the European Commission, on the basis of a general vote lead ” to Europe a face ”. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> However, this is definitely one of the approved by Congress, which clearly Antragsvorschläge Wolfgang Schäuble godfather. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 soon on this revolution: some Groβ - Britain, is opposed to the cause, and the Leitenden believe the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The milestone, however. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> Likewise, the delegates in a vast majority of the proposal of the weighting of any country in the ECB &apos;s Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, rejected what appears to be a more powerful the position of Germany. </seg>

<seg id="2473"> As far as the Europe - request the relevance of the “ Franco - german ” a clause, calls on Angela Merkel France not to the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> At least not directly. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> Because this serves as a reminder that, Leipzig two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> What represents the fraud at Krankmeldungen? </seg>
<seg id="2478"> After the family benefits take (UMP) and the government now Krankmeldungen in attack. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, arrive for a visit Familienbeihilfekasse and made a speech on the already - since 2007 has always recurring theme of the fight against social fraud, as well as economic dependence on the state. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> This attack to accompany the of the will, the economy in a Härteprobe, on the other hand, not just as a harbinger of the axis of the right - wing presidential campaign, will the majority on Arbeitnehmerkrankmeldungen focus. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> First, with haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a Krankmeldung by workers in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company the pay of four days, would lose, so at least 15% of its monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> A Maβnahme which, according to the newspaper, “ Les echoes ” threatens to provoke anger, however, would help, 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> And with a different Maβnahme more symbolic nature: the state officials were accompanied by a unvergüteten Karenztag in Krankheitsfalle give (so far they have, in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist). </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Meanwhile, these questions in the debate, sparked the majority also anew the Betrugsthematik, this time at the Arbeitsabsenz associated with abuse are targeted. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> “ Inspections will be much more important, and furthermore, these rückzuvergüten, if this is called for, ” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 before the microphone to the station RTL. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> As in other cases, the effects of this news about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krankmeldungen a little unproportioniert. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> This is, in fact, already since 2002, the subject of permanent observation and political offensive, the most common have borne fruit. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The French are not more ill more often than those elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> However, our first in the nation - wide paragraphs. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM were in 2006, more than EUR 237 million Tagesabfindungen paid off. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> The Gemäβ Wirtschaftsforschungs Dokumentationsinstituts - and the health system, the Tagesabfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of the health - care costs. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave, as well as industrial accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube, the heiβt 6.2 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> And so, 2.5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> In the year 2010, the French to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting group, on average, only 14.5 Krankentage granted. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> An average of certain differences covered up, a different, in 2007 of monster. com, a website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40 000. surveyed, french workers, not a single Krankentag had. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of the Krankmeldungen in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, between 15% and 15 days a month ago, 15% of between one and three months and 11% over. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Compared with its european neighbours, the french workers is not more than elsewhere to disability benefits. </seg>

<seg id="2500"> The fraud at Krankmeldungen is a very small proportion on the black market. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> On the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> The encouraging the legislation since 2002, means that it controls on systmatische Krankmeldungen are 45 days. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> In 2008, the CNAM (public college education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks that 13% of 000 of past, short - term Krankmeldungen, the heiβt in 37.050 cases ”, abusive or too long. ” </seg>
<seg id="2504"> In the systematically controlled Krankmeldungsfällen of more than 45 days the long term if you were among 1.2 million 11% of “ unangepassten or unjustified ” cases, heiβt 132.000. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Overall, this is 169.000 “ unjustified ” cases to millions of workers, a Krankmeldung. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> A paragraph, the only a weak Ausmaβ against, for example, that of the undeclared work represents. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> According to the UMP members Dominique Tian, author of one published in July Sachberichts with regard to this issue, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro Steuergewinnausfall per year, i. e. more than the total cost of Tagesvergütungen, and thus far more than the Defraudation that. </seg>

<seg id="2522"> The canadian company is living in a recipe to the death. </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Only 9% of Canadians who are, in fact, with their doctor to speak on the conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements for this purpose. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report of the Royal Society of Canada, to the six experts were involved in various disciplines, among other things, ethics, law and medicine, are related to each other. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> This panel recommends the government, so the penal code to amend assisted suicide and to allow euthanasia, where this election, and in patients than in the situation, to make such a decision. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> As a prelude to the experts cite a recent survey of the independent society EIU, the Todesqualität in 40 countries of the Erdballes compared with each other. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Although Canada is in the 10th grade centers, the study noted that “ the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to broach the subject of death ”. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts. </seg>

<seg id="2716"> Is immigration burden or chance for the economy? </seg>
<seg id="2717"> The of Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s immigration policy has been criticized from many corners - of - police, judicial and governing bodies, as a result of the figures derive policy, a combination of this policy with the status of a “ country of human rights ”, as France call themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> Recently, the foreign students directed against harassment of administrative side the Wochenschauen marked, the interior minister had in passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France “ no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad need. ” </seg>
<seg id="2719"> But this policy was rarely, from an economic point of view. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> On this issue is a wide consensus between right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> By right - wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, the mood in 1976 had stated that, “ 000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, it is not a problem for a country should be, ” by left - wing side by Michel Rocard, the 1990, France had expressed “ could not the whole of poverty in the world. ” </seg>
<seg id="2722"> One difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The fear of the invasion of national land by hordes of polish plumber was in 2005 on both the right and left. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> By both camps were immigrants as a burden for the economy and the french society. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> The only difference is the extent to which the Groβzügigkeit, be towards immigrants are willing to admit. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on trite, the co - development would like it, our “ Contrary to resolve. ” </seg>
<seg id="2727"> This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may be on the elections effect; but it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> As the economists and Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work, the latest findings on the immigration together (Exceptional People: how Migration Shaped our and our World Will Define Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.) among the specialists, there is a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood on economic growth, jobs and wages in the destination. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The immigration would limit the growth of calm and the labour market. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that this risk, the indigenous workers, particularly the less skilled, substitutes, putting pressure on their pay. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> However, experience shows that the migrants in fact much complementary than than the local grounds, as they schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> The low - skilled immigrants working in sectors, the local grounds little annoy, the higher quality among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the supply line. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> Positive Lohneffekt </seg>
<seg id="2734"> As well as a surgeon difficulties would have in a country to work, where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Giovanni Peri, in this way, calculated that a 1% disabled rise in the flood of miteinbezogene, a long - term increase in wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> And this does not take into account the fact that the of the immigrants&apos; s diversity of Ideenschöpfung, as well as the economic growth is the (high proportion of immigrants from naturalized american Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been of immigrants founded). </seg>
<seg id="2737"> The migrants are also a net to the social security system, in european countries, on average, for a total of about 1% of the entire budget. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that one at the age of 30 years after Germany einwandernde person the public budget, on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus spending) of the 150,000 euros. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate the intersection with the lack of “ teeth ”. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Question teeth, the immigrants would shock, however, exactly the opposite effect. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> Europe has a democracy, so it remains, european democracy to rethink </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate asset. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The european continent itself should remind you who is after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the whole of the 20th century the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, the gulag, but also in Franco &apos;s Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece has had to endure. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Some were believed that it would be sufficient, the right to vote, to representative possible way to democracy once and for all of their enemies will prevail. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> We know since Napoleon the “ small ” that it is a feature of the state of mind. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> The general right to vote, the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can just as well for the “ repression ”, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers, and control a training, education, economic and social spirit, a jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is also very much and, first and foremost, political and democratic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2749"> The attitude of the greek Wahr - wrong - referendum would have been in this regard twice: once the insightful nature of the need for a strong return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the alarming sense of their inability to deliver their Unangebrachtheit. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> This ambivalence should be seen as outdated. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today have shifted, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer moving in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> We have nothing to gain, to the success of the national referendum, which, depending on the needs and in or order was organised. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> A Freischein for the european or a giant leap with their eyes in the hollowness of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from right, clear and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at the european level. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, incidentally, has already no longer, where the list to end - as it is only a single crisis, and that there is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> It is the whole of Europe, the dictates of the markets and rating agencies prevents that under his impotence and his Solidaritätsmangel suffers. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> It is the whole of Europe, which humiliated at international level. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> It is concerned about Souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and every single one of the nations connected him. </seg>
<seg id="2759"> The urgency is the sovereignty of the leadership of the european project back. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Because it is on the set, whether the Europeans the burden of debt reduction from the markets to a future through investment at hand. </seg>
<seg id="2761"> The exit from the crisis has decisions at the european level on the condition that is not complete without democratic Rechtmäβigkeit can be passed without sure to destruction. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time to tackle, today, one in the european economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> I agree. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> But this without political integration and greater democracy, as they have in mind - present, would be a new folly and another dead end. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> We need a new stage of european integration. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> In the Republic of France to create, it took the fact that Republicans to “ create ”. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The revolution of the interests of alone, it is not enough. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> This instruction is still valid. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> On the economic front, we need a more integrated Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe, creating a truly european sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> We need Europeans to Europe. </seg>

<seg id="2859"> The Nord Stream gas pipeline, at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe directly with Russia, has been in operation. </seg>
<seg id="2860"> You should gas for the equivalent of 30 million households. </seg>

<seg id="2866"> And it has the possibility of the construction of a third line of which led to themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge Bauwerkes as a victory. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The project has been in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> The Nord Stream pipeline is a direct flow of gas to Germany, and in preventing any Trassenverlaufs through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> For that reason, these two countries a little of their power: for them, it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia, by threatening to gain access to western european markets, to close down. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Warsaw, most in the debate, was not to be avoided, the Nord Stream pipeline with a “ new german - sowietischen pact ” in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Western Europe has to support this russian project an even higher security of supply. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> But at the expense of starvation of a european energy, because the project is blazing a trail between West and East Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Russia has it in barely five years ago, to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out. </seg>

<seg id="2886"> “ In the event of an accident we close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute, ” stated Mr Müller. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In the event of a leak in the pipeline leaks out of the gas in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> This case is of designers, however, is likely to be seen as a little, since the Schweiβnähte on consistency of a leak per 100,000 years been estimated. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> The state surveillance of the gas pipeline, both by a robot submarine, the external Observationszwecken by a Seeschiff from is managed, as well as by a device, in the heart of the pipeline is circulating. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, is in the heart of the pipeline and gas pressure by the move. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when they arrive very specific information about possible deformations in the metal. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> The pipeline was designed to 50 years to work, without the slightest repairs will be subjected to. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> This 200 cash to the access - 100 cash to the Austrittsstelle. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Five companies have to implement this project their forces. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> The Leitungsführung, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, the 51% of the shares. </seg>
